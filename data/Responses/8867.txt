Questions

II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?

  Q1.   [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access
        online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
         NO


  Q2.   [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide
        online services across borders in the EU?
         NO OPINION


  Q3.   [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are
        you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests
        per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
        concerned.
              It is common to receive requests for multi-territory licences and indeed tens of
              thousands of such licences for literary works are issued annually by rightsholders
              in the EU/EEA/EFTA, throughout the world, or to groups of countries that share
              the same language.

              Collective Management Organisations also issue such licences, working in
              collaboration with their counterparts not just in the EU but throughout the
              world.

              Individual members will provide detailed answers to this question.



  Q4.   If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be
        the best way to tackle them?
              For literary works, market-based solutions offered by rightsholders or Collective
              Management Organisations and other licensing agents, on a voluntary non-
              exclusive basis, work well, allowing wide user access while helping to protect
              against illegal use.



  Q5.   [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
        reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in

                                                                             Review of EU Copyright Rules




        question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service
        provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain
        European countries)?
        NO
               Cross border licensing already takes place in the EU, where there is a suitable
               demand and rightsholders are able to produce a reasonable case for their
               business to do so. Copyright is not the key barrier to cross border access to
               content and services, but rather it is limitations resulting from exchange rates and
               taxation rules that need to be resolved.



  Q6.   [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in
        cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you
        would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient
        (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying
        to access)?
        NO OPINION



  Q7.   Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions)
        are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single
        Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
        YES – Please explain
        6.    It would be helpful to extend the Services Directive to apply to both intellectual
              property and services related to delivering intellectual property, in order to
              improve content availability and protection for rightsholders. This would include
              service providers, platforms, search engines and social media websites offering
              copyright content, who should take more responsibility in raising consumer
              awareness of the protection that copyright offers, including by assisting users in
              finding legitimate content, advising them on the ways in which copyright can be
              infringed and available sanctions and directing consumers away from infringing
              content. We believe that such stakeholders should work more proactively with
              rightsholders to create an environment respecting legitimate content, which
              would enhance the end user experience, leading to an increase in consumer
              choice as well as providing opportunities for innovation and development of
              content and services that facilitate the smooth circulation of content legally
              available or sourced.



B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or
not) in digital transmissions?

1. The act of making available

  Q8.   Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
        disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
        YES
        7.      For civil proceedings, ALPSP and its members believe that the scope is clear and
                that the conflict of law principles mean that copyright can be enforced
                adequately. For criminal proceedings the competence of enforcement

                                                                                        ALPSP Response
                                                                           Review of EU Copyright Rules



                authorities is sometimes unclear. There would be economic benefits if there
                were greater cooperation and coordination from all involved parties in
                delivering digital works and enforcing illegal use of such works.



  Q9.    [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the
        “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are
        considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights
        or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of
        injunctive relief)?
         NO
         8.     ALPSP is not aware of practical problems regarding the definition of
                “authorship” in the EU with regard to “making available”.

        9.     A “country of origin” rule would substantially weaken the usefulness of the right.
               The right is most useful when an infringement action can be brought against
               someone who does not make an unauthorised reproduction in a territory, but has
               done so or assisted/facilitated the making of the copy in another jurisdiction.



2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

  Q10. [In particular if you are a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to
       a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
       problems for you?
         NO
        10.     For literary works, the two rights (reproduction right and right of making
                available) are mostly held by the same rightsholder or its agent, so in practice
                there are few, if any, practical problems.

        11.     However, it is still useful to distinguish between the rights, particularly where
                the user wishes to acquire a licence only for reproduction rights, but
                subsequently may wish to add “making available”.

        12.     The differences between the two rights reflect different user preferences and
                allow scaled pricing and customer segmentation so that the customer can elect
                which right they need to carry out their activities.



3. Linking and browsing

  Q11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
       copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of
       the rightholder?
         NO
         13.    Hyperlinks leading to an authorised copy of work should not be subject to
                rightsholder’s prior approval, provided the rightsholder can set restrictions on
                access to the material.

         14.    Automated access restrictions, such as crawling restrictions, must be adhered to
                by search engines.

                                                                                      ALPSP Response
                                                                         Review of EU Copyright Rules




         15.    Those producing legitimate content would, in most cases, be satisfied to see that
                links to that content were raising awareness and assisting in the discovery
                process.

        16.     However, providing links comes with a responsibility to ensure that the content
                being linked to is legal. Requiring permission to include a hyperlink will not deal
                with those who deliberately supply a link to illegal, pirated content.



  Q12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
       other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the
       user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
       authorisation of the rightholder?
         NO
         17.    Reproductions which are both temporary and incidental to an authorised act
                should not require additional consent.

         18.    However, it is too simplistic to assume that all “cache” memory copies are
                temporary and incidental. This should be considered on a case by case basis and
                should be left to national courts to determine.



4. Download to own digital content

  Q13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell
       digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
         NO OPINION


  Q14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of
       providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please
       specify per market (type of content) concerned.
         19.    Licence terms should prevail for literary works. Both for books and journal
                articles, content is now being licensed by chapter, extract and dataset. Users
                receive electronic works and other subject matter under a variety of conditions
                including temporary access, streaming, discounts, bundling of print and
                electronic copies, time restricted subscription access and special formats.

         20.    Regulations may reduce consumer choice, particularly at the lower cost end of
                the market.

         21.    Laws forbidding restrictions on resale may lead to higher prices and fewer
                consumer options and make rightsholders cautious about entering new digital
                markets and trying new business models.

         22.    In addition, where there is International exhaustion of rights, such as for
                academic textbooks, a resale right may lead to publishers implementing the
                same pricing structure across all territories meaning that not all textbooks will be
                available at lower prices for markets with lower purchasing power. Academic
                text book publishers will have to factor in the anticipated reuse when setting

                  prices, making the initial copy more expensive and therefore increasing the risk
                  of piracy and unauthorised use.



C. Registration of works and other subject matter?

    Q15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
         works and other subject matter?
           NO OPINION
           23. It is possible that a voluntary registration system could be useful. However the
               drawbacks of such a system for both rightsholders and users should be fully
               considered – see answers to the following two questions.

           24.    There are alternatives to such a registration system, which may prove much more
                  useful for the end-user, such as the Copyright Hub1 and initiatives such as the
                  Linked Content Coalition2 and the Content Map3.



    Q16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
          25.     The potential benefits would be that rightsholder and ownership information
                  would be available and searchable and that users and rightsholders would
                  therefore be able to identify potential licensors more easily. However this is
                  exactly the framework being envisioned by the Copyright Hub (as paragraph 24),
                  a system which will work with the already extensive databases of content and
                  rights in existence across the creative industries.



    Q17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
          26.    This would be an extraordinary heavy burden on both creators and publishers.
                 The most disadvantaged by this system would be individual creators and other
                 smaller rightsholders, who may not be aware of the system. This could put them
                 at a competitive disadvantage and distort the market.

          27.    For larger rightsholders, it could well prove too expensive if every title has to be
                 registered (particularly manually), especially if there is no simple and
                 straightforward way of registering change of ownership and reversion of rights.

                  Finally, a registration system could violate essential rights under Article 5 of the
                  Berne Convention.




    Q18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
                 In Germany, for instance, already based on §53a of the German Copyright Act,
                 publishers who wish to reserve the right to authorise document delivery by public
                 libraries individually by offering reasonable licensing terms (a kind of “opt-out”

               from an otherwise applicable statutory license administered by VG Wort), must
               make their choice “obvious” to the users. In practice this is met by publishers
               notifying their offer of licences on reasonable terms through the EZB, a database
               of library content resources that lists over 9,000 journals in this way. The EZB
               (apart from its other functions) also operates as a registration agency for those
               publishers that make use of this facility by offering a voluntary registration
               facility of titles/journals. This is developed jointly by the German Publisher
               Association and the University of Regensburg, where EZB is housed. For more
               information see: http://rzblx1.uni-
               regensburg.de/ezeit/ppVabout.phtml?bibid=AAAAA&colors=7&lang=en&vid=&.

               Other advantages of voluntary registration are special damages and
               presumptions could attach to registration. Registration could allow rightsholders
               who offer older works for licensing to “reserve” their rights for individual
               transactions that might otherwise be administered through voluntary collective
               licenses. Registration of use with information about the work used would be
               appropriate for use of orphan works under an exception or statutory licence.



D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

  Q19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
       sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and
       permissions databases?
               We suggest that the EU should follow the UK and develop an EU Copyright Hub,
               or a simple extension to the UK Hub itself.

               We would also like to see the EU encourage adoption of appropriate standards,
               perhaps as an enabler for their development and adoption.



E. Term of protection

  Q20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
         YES
               ALPSP sees no need to change the term of copyright protection as we see no
               difference in work required to create and publish copyright content between the
               digital and analogue environments. It is the distribution, availability and ease of
               duplication of such content that has changed.

               At the other extreme, public domain or mandated unfunded open access does
               not lead in practice to wider or sustainable access. It may actually make the
               content less easy to access for the general research community and thus make the
               length of copyright protection less relevant.

               In practice, orphan works legislation and industry-led solutions for out-of-
               commerce works provide adequate mechanisms to allow access to older works
               that lack a significant market or a steward or interested custodian, including by
               reason of expiry of time. In the field of ALPSP publishers, publisher-agreed or
               negotiated embargo periods may often substantially reduce the significance of

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

  Q21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
       copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
         NO
               While there is some potential for confusion, particularly for end-users, it is
               important to preserve the diverse legal and cultural traditions of the Member
               States. It is also doubtful whether a single EU-level framework could be devised
               to account for all variations.

               In practice, discrepancies in the application of exceptions and limitations can be
               easily dealt with through licensing agreements.

               At the present time, there are no such circumstances that the scholarly publishing
               industry is not able to address, though problems may arise in that some are not
               willing to consider, far less discuss, market-led solutions.



  Q22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
       level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
         NO
               Within the EU there are many different cultures, market traditions and stages of
               market saturation of available copyright-protected works. It would be
               inappropriate to take action at EU level which could prevent member states from
               introducing equally effective exceptions at local level which are more sympathetic
               to local norms and needs.

               Whilst an exception in a particular Member State may be unproblematic, in
               another it might create a conflict with the three-step test, due to different
               market conditions. Even if, at EU level, an exception may be agreed and made
               mandatory, the interpretation of the wording would still require guidance from
               local courts leading to inevitable local variations.

               It should be open to Member States to provide that any exceptions are capable of
               being overridden by contract. Limiting freedom of contract would decrease
               consumer choice and interfere with cross-border trade where licensing
               agreements provide balanced solutions and certainty of subject matter.

               Member States should continue to be permitted to address their national
               legislation as they see fit. If some/all exceptions were appropriate in all Member
               States, the harmonisation would have happened naturally already.



  Q23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
       catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
         NO

                                                                          Review of EU Copyright Rules




               There is no compelling case for introducing new exceptions at this point in time.
               New limitations or exceptions require clear, compelling and widely agreed and
               acknowledged evidence of their necessity, which is simply not the case currently.

               Exceptions and limitations should address either public interests that are deemed
               outside the ambit of markets or concepts meant to address market failure.

               Exceptions were particularly useful in the past where it was difficult for user and
               rightsholder to have direct contact to make contractual agreements. This is
               clearly not the case in the digital world.

               Users and rightsholders can tailor-make and agree solutions in a dynamic way
               that maintains pace with the market and technological developments, something
               that legislation finds difficult.

               Exceptions are blunt instruments that can inhibit the development of market-
               based solutions. Implementing new exceptions prematurely would stifle business
               innovation and the ability of publishers to develop new products and services
               with new markets and consumer needs in mind.



  Q24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
       flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
         NO
               The existing EU regulatory framework is flexible enough.



  Q25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national
       courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
       in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
       explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an
       approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
               Fair use, even in the United States, with years of case law, only offers an
               exception from copyright infringement for the individual user’s case. It does not
               provide any legal certainty or predictability for both users and rightsholders, and
               encourages litigation (see for example the long-running litigation over Google’s
               unlicensed scanning of library materials).

               In ALPSP’s view, “fair use” is evolving in a direction that is no longer oriented
               towards copyright cases that involve only a single user and the incidence and
               effects of copying, but is instead being deployed to address phenomena that
               could be described as systematic copying, or copying with a cumulative effect that
               is detrimental, even where an individual instance would have been fair; also,
               increasingly copying is suggested to be fair that is predictable and not
               spontaneous.

               The concept of “fair use” shifts the decision from the legislature to the judge and
               is not in the interests of sound societal decision-making about copyright
               permitted acts in the EU.

    Q26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
           NO
                 As already mentioned, differences in territoriality of exception and limitations
                 can and are resolved by contractual provisions.



    Q27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
         border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
         compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
                 The user should primarily be responsible for payment, but the entity providing
                 the copy should also be primarily jointly and severally liable. The provider would
                 then have clear incentive to ensure fair compensation is paid to the rightsholder.

                 In practice it would be an extremely difficult task to define such a provision given
                 the complexities of cross-border usage in the digital age; pragmatic, market-
                 based solutions are likely to be more successful.



A. Access to content in libraries and archives


1. Preservation and archiving

    Q28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when
         trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your
         collection?

          (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
          libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
           NO


    Q29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
                 Access problems may be better solved through public-private partnerships, rather
                 than through unilateral beneficiary rights or exceptions.

                 Some examples in the scholarly publishing field include the not for profit
                 PORTICO4 and CLOCKSS5 which have provided enormously efficient ways to
                 archive and protect scientific content, published in electronic form.

                 These illustrate that, in the digital and online world, exceptions achieve little if
                 there is no enabling framework – a point publishers have also repeatedly made as
                 part of “Licences for Europe” in the context of Text and Data Mining for non-
                 commercial research purposes, and also in the context of the 2011 MoU for out-
                 of-commerce works6. The same point has also been made in relation to access for
                 visually impaired persons in the run up to the Marrakesh Treaty facilitating access
                 for the blind and print disabled.

               Exceptions alone would not have accomplished such comprehensive preservation
               as is being undertaken through PORTICO, CLOCKSS and other archiving and
               preservation services.



  Q30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
       activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
               A legislative solution is not necessary at this point in time. For non-orphan works,
               rightsholders should be consulted and asked for consent to copies being made.
               This way the market finds new ways of making content useful and accessible.
               This has been very successful in scholarly publishing where digital migration has
               changed dramatically the way content is distributed and used, with a positive
               impact. An alternative are public-private partnerships which can adapt to change
               in the digital world.



  Q31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
               No further comment.



2. Off premises access to library collections

  Q32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when
       trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,
       including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and
       private study?

        (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
        when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the
        collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the
        premises of the institutions in question?

        (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional
        users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the
        works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
               Remote access is standard in many licences and is often cross-border. It is
               negotiated and can affect pricing and other licence terms. For users not affiliated
               to academic institutions, walk-in access is often available (for example through
               the Access to Research initiative in the UK), and content may be purchased
               through numerous pay-per-view and rental services, in addition to document
               delivery services provided by national libraries or library consortia.



  Q33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
               Difficulties can be best solved by market-based solutions. Rightsholders can issue
               cross-border licences.

  Q34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
       activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
               Legislation is likely to stifle innovation and the development of new business
               models where appropriate.



  Q35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
               No further comment.



3. e-Lending

  Q36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to
       negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of
       books or other materials held in your collection?

        (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
        when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
        borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

        (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to
        enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
         YES
               Publishers negotiate cross-border e-lending agreements with individual libraries,
               library consortia (national, regional or local), and with Collective Management
               Organizations for limited forms of document delivery that could be described as
               “e-lending”, but really is a form of document supply on request/electronic inter
               library loan. Specific terms are negotiated and in many cases, non-commercial
               supply of individual journal articles on request is permissible to researchers,
               students and academics, while preserving the market for commercial supply of
               journal articles at publisher-set rates.

               Individual members will provide further details.



  Q37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
               Ensuring that rightsholders can contract across borders and ensuring that local
               law is followed by libraries would greatly facilitate e-lending.



  The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

  Q38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the management of
       physical and online collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems
       have you encountered?
               No comment.

  Q39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional
       activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises
       (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
               The supply of documents on demand and at a distance (i.e. not for pick-up in the
               library) puts libraries into competition with publishers in ways that were not
               present in the traditional role of the library. Providing library services at a
               distance also creates competition between libraries.

               Publishers have developed licensing solutions that address these new features in
               bespoke licensing arrangements, consortia licensing arrangements and even
               national access licensing arrangements.

               Where electronic resources are concerned, licensing terms and negotiations
               usually provide for adequate ways of resolving the operational needs of libraries
               as key purchasers of content. Where libraries, however, convert print and offline
               materials acquired for on-site use to digital format (via scanning or OCR) and
               offer them for delivery at a distance, the potential for a conflict and unfair
               competition exists, for example with publishers’ commercial document delivery/e-
               lending services.

               The quid pro quo for participating libraries and consortia of libraries is that they
               agree on a process that is designed to minimise the abuse of this preferential
               access beyond the intended classes of persons (academics, researchers, students,
               certain social services or government departments as may be agreed).



4. Mass digitisation

  Q40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation
       projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your
       country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
       concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of
       commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
         NO OPINION
             The MoU of 2011 does not just involve national libraries and collective
             management organisations, but also authors and publishers. It is stated clearly in
             the MoU that all relevant parties need to negotiate any mass digitization projects
             on a voluntary basis.

               The collective management organisations then facilitate implementation of
               underlying principles that have been agreed locally.

               It is important to recognise that, unlike orphan works, out-of-commerce works
               are not a homogenous class of works: their status is due to a multitude of factors,
               cultural, social, historical, or the specific choice of the rightsholder. Thus, unlike
               orphan works, a one-size-fits all solution is not appropriate and requires a
               balanced approach, particularly where cross-border access is concerned. For this
               reason, ALPSP wishes to emphasise the feature in the 2011 MoU that mandates
               an “opt-in” system for out-of-commerce works that are used very intensively or
               frequently. This is a flexible test that is designed to provide a yardstick that allows
               a rightsholder whose works are used intensively or frequently to bring the work
               back to life with new authorised editions. The other effect of this is that the fair

               compensation can be kept relatively low for out-of –commerce works that are not
               used intensively or frequently.



  Q41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of
       content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
         NO OPINION


B. Teaching

  Q42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
       specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching,
       including across borders?

        (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
        the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
        across borders?
         YES – Please explain
              While education is generally a copyright-compliant sector, it is still important that
              national exceptions provide carve-out for works where teaching is the primary
              market. This is already in existence in Spain, France, Germany (partly) and
              Hungary.

               Where there is no carve-out, there is the potential that the exception may be
               applied in a way which contravenes the Berne three-step test.

               It is unacceptable to try and use an exception to by-pass the educational materials
               market i.e. to avoid buying text books and materials purpose-made for teaching.



  Q43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
               Please refer to the answer to Q42 above.



  Q44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for
       teaching purposes? How successful are they?
               Content for teaching purposes is frequently authorised as part of negotiated
               licences with educational institutions. There are also well-established secondary
               licensing schemes available through collective rights management organizations
               such as CLA in the UK.



  Q45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
       activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
               ALPSP does not believe that a legislative solution is needed. Direct license models
               supported by secondary licenses are functioning effectively.

  Q46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
                  Licensed solutions should be encouraged wherever possible.



C. Research

  Q47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
       specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the context of research
       projects/activities, including across borders?

        (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
        the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of research
        projects/activities, including across borders?
         NO
                  Uses of content, including cross-border, are regularly and successfully dealt with
                  by negotiated licences. In addition, there are numerous initiatives aimed at
                  extending access, such as Research for Life in developing nations, Access to
                  Research in the UK and CHORUS in the United States. Use of content is catered
                  for by direct licenses or by secondary licenses via collective management
                  associations. Rightsholders have some concerns about the unauthorized sharing
                  of published content through scientific social networks, but this can be addressed
                  through education and enforcement.



  Q48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
                  See answer to Q47 above.



  Q49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research
       purposes? How successful are they?
                  See answer to Q47 above.




D. Disabilities


  Q50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons
       with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across
       borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

        (b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:] Have
        you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special formats
        across the EU?

           (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
           the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of
           works published in special formats, including across borders?
            NO – Please explain by giving examples
                 ALPSP recognizes that exceptions and limitations in favour of the visually
                 impaired are necessary, and we are fully supportive of initiatives to enhance
                 access that are carefully crafted and proportionate, and do not undermine
                 market norms.



     Q51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
                  ALPSP supports initiatives such as TIGAR7and other collaborations that bring
                  together relevant stakeholders. It is more important that the technology for
                  making digital works accessible to visually-impaired persons should be accessible
                  across borders than the content itself given the territorially-specific nature of
                  most text-based works.



     Q52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How successful
          are they?
                  Support for the TIGAR8 project has begun to improve accessibility across borders
                  and should be encouraged. It is disappointing that not all national bodies for the
                  visually impaired have signed up to support this, which has slowed access to
                  content in certain territories.

                  It is important that exceptions should not stifle market solutions. Public and
                  private partnerships are needed to guide visually impaired people to easiest and
                  most convenient access point.



E. Text and data mining


     Q53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
          obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods, including across
          borders?

           (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
           copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
           borders?

           (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
           the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across
           borders?
            NO OPINION
                The market for text and data mining (TDM) is still in its infancy. Despite this, the
                scholarly publishing industry has responded to market demand and is piloting, or

                  has already launched, solutions which will facilitate researchers wishing to mine
                  scholarly information. Examples include the Publishers’ Licensing Society
                  permissions portal (PLS Clear) and CrossRef’s Prospect content access service. In
                  addition, the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical
                  Publishers (STM Association) has developed a standard text and data mining
                  license, and individual rightsholders are working to implement licenses and access
                  methods to support TDM.

                  Solutions to address commercial needs are also in development, such as the
                  Copyright Clearance Center’s TDM platform and solutions being developed by the
                  Pharma-Documentation-Ring (P-D-R) in collaboration with scholarly publishers.

                  The STM Association Declaration9, issued as part of the “Licences for Europe”
                  process, commits publishers to facilitating non-commercial TDM on subscribed
                  content in the EU, and to developing simplified licensing and access schemes.

                  It should not be forgotten that TDM also has implications for websites and
                  business models. Text and data mining is best managed through licensing rather
                  than copyright exceptions, as licenses offer much greater certainty and security
                  around issues such as the impact of crawling on publisher platforms, the potential
                  for unauthorized redistribution of content, or the creation of derivative products
                  and services from copied content.



     Q54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
                  As noted above, solutions are being developed to meet the currently low level of
                  demand for TDM in the EU. Any solutions must be market-based and involve all
                  relevant stakeholders. A copyright exception is likely to significantly discourage
                  innovation in the market, and will offer little if any certainty to users wishing to
                  access content and perform TDM. Indeed, legislation alone will not solve any of
                  the technology or security issues that need to be addressed in this context.



     Q55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
          activities should be covered and under what conditions?
                  We do not consider that a legislative solution is required as the market is already
                  facilitating the demand for text and data mining under the existing legislative
                  framework.

                  An exception should only be considered in a case of market failure, which is
                  patently not the case at the present time.



     Q56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
                  We consider that the market is already providing solutions which are addressing
                  both non-commercial and commercial needs. Market-based solutions developed
                  in collaboration with all stakeholder groups are essential to enable successful
                  TDM in the EU context.

  Q57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of text or data
       mining methods?
               Technological and security issues are more significant than copyright issues in
               relation to TDM, and these are also being addressed by the market.

               ALPSP would also like to emphasize that it is essential to consider the implications
               of any legislative change on smaller scholarly and professional publishers who are
               not able to provide the sophisticated, expensive solutions that larger publishers
               can. Such smaller organisations will take additional time to provide the
               appropriate technical provisions, but this should not be taken as any indication
               that they are unwilling to engage and facilitate text and data mining.



F. User-generated content

  Q58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems when trying
       to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,
       including across borders?

        (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
        publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
        through your service, including across borders?

        (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the
        way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content
        on the Internet, including across borders?
         YES
               Creators and other rightsholders are not opposed to the incorporation of
               portions of existing works in new works where reasonable, and scientific &
               professional publishing in particular has long allowed this, subject to standard
               rules, with appropriate credit and normally at no cost.

               However, even non-commercial uses can potentially harm creators’ rights by
               competing with legitimate sales if offered on commercial sites.

               Any exceptions or statutory licences should be avoided, or at best very narrowly
               drafted, for user-created content clearly designed for private use.



  Q59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you experienced
       problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
       works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?

        (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that are
        publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)
        through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
         NO OPINION
             No comment.

  Q60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you experienced
       problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have created (on the basis
       of pre-existing works)?

        (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for users
        publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)
        through your service?
         YES
               In general ALPSP members do not publish works created on the basis of pre-
               existing works, except as noted above.



  Q61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
               The scholarly and professional publishing industries have well-established
               conventions governing re-use of pre-existing work, whether through citation or
               quotation, or through reproduction of figures and tables. There are well-
               established systems in place for clearing permissions, whether directly with
               publishers or through intermediary services such as the Copyright Clearance
               Center’s RightsLink service. The PLS Clear and the UK Copyright Hub are further
               examples of significant innovation in this area.



  Q62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
       activities should be covered and under what conditions?
               We do not believe a legislative solution is necessary.



  Q63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
               The scholarly and professional publishing industry has already provided solutions
               to granting rights and receiving remuneration for repurposing works.



IV. Private copying and reprography

  Q64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
       copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
         NO
               Levies are still important in the digital world, particularly on storage devices. The
               small risk of “double payments” does not outweigh the larger risk of no
               payments to authors and publishers.

               Also, if fees are paid to different entities receiving different benefits from the
               work, this is not double payment unless the amount paid is, in both cases, for the
               same use/service.

               Levies are not the preferred option to compensate copyright owners but are the
               last resort where the work is on the market and the user is likely to make
               additional lawful uses of the material. Levies must not prevent or interfere with

               the contract between rightsholders and end users and are not meant to
               compensate for piracy.



  Q65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has
       been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
       private copying levies?
         YES
               Provided the harm is “minimal”, no levy should be owing. However, caution is
               advised before assuming that any harm is “minimal”.

               Unless private copying is fully taken into account, and is part of a user licence,
               compensation should not be waived.



  Q66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services
       based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices)
       impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
       rightholders’ revenue on the other?
               Cloud based systems are developing fast and publishers provide content to many
               users with cloud services. When creating a levy scheme, care must be taken not
               to imply that there is a “flat rate” which would not incentivise quality content. A
               cloud based service presents challenges for a levy scheme as fewer permanent
               copies are made and the storage device could be based anywhere in the world.
               We would suggest that a cloud based levy is based on the number of end user
               devices rather than on the equipment itself.



  Q67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to
       levies?
         YES
               Levies on equipment purchased by commercial organisations should be refunded
               on request (possible in Austria already). Commercial organisations cannot take
               advantage of the private copy exception and internal copying must be
               compensated by corporate licence not levy. There is no reason why commercial
               organisations should pay a levy when the equipment is only used for professional
               or business purposes.



  Q68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
       payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of
       goods or services?
         NO
               No comment.



  Q69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for
       purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue

        transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

  Q70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent
       could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member
       States help to remedy the situation?
               No comment.



  Q71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how
       would these problems best be solved?
               No comment.




V. Fair remuneration for authors and performers

  Q72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of
       mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
       works and performances?
               Scholarly and professional publishing is perhaps an unusual industry in this
               regard. Authors contributing to literary works do so not for financial gain, but as
               part of the recognition and tenure system of institutions. The existing mechanism
               of a free and open market among publishers allows the maximum possible author
               choice in terms of where to publish to best meet their needs in this respect.

               Authors of any type of literary content may register with their local collecting
               society in order to receive recompense for secondary copying of their work(s).



  Q73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?
         NO – Please explain why
              The scholarly and professional communications ecosystem should not be unfairly
              penalised just because its normal behaviour differs from that in other markets.



  Q74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the
       shortcomings you identify?

VI. Respect for rights

  Q75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of
       copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
         YES
               Where a commercial organisation has a proven record of infringing copyright
               repeatedly, or has a business model based upon encouraging others to infringe,
               more efficient enforcement methods would be appreciated.

               Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be encouraged to assist in the removal of
               access to the internet of those with a proven intent to infringe copyright.

               If the same content is the subject of multiple notices, ISPs should filter against
               reposting.

               The Enforcement Directive should extend the presumption of copyright
               ownership to holders of exclusive licences or copyright assignees. In practice, it is
               rarely the author, and mostly the publisher, that will have resources to take legal
               action, and even then it is likely to be larger publishers that have appropriate
               resources. Time and resources are often wasted proving ownership, even where a
               defendant has no basis at all to contest it.

               Rightsholders’ interests can be damaged as much by commercial as non-
               commercial activities.



  Q76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
       intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers,
       domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial
       purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
               Intermediaries and advertisers have little incentive to cooperate with
               rightsholders’ efforts to prevent or act upon infringement.

               Advertisers and intermediaries should be required to take reasonable measures to
               prevent infringements or withdraw services when notified of individual
               infringements or customers engaging in infringing practices on a persistent basis.



  Q77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between
       the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life
       and protection of personal data?
         NO – Please explain
              The balance does not appropriately protect against infringement and allows ISPs
              and advertisers to make money in ways harmful to the interests of authors and
              rightsholders.

VII. A single EU Copyright Title

  Q78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
       establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well
       as a single framework for enforcement?
         NO
               A single framework for copyright is neither desired nor necessary, as it will restrict
               the positive cultural differences between Member States.

               A co-ordinated framework for dealing with copyright infringement in the EU
               would, on the other hand, be very welcome.



  Q79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level
       of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
               The Commission should prioritise the enforcement of existing rules, encourage
               the development of market-led solutions and facilitate productive dialogue and
               promotion of voluntary solutions such as MOUs.



VIII. Other issues

  Q80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please
       explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
               No further comment.
