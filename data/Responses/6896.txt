                          Response to public consultation on the
                          review of the EU copyright rules

                          March 2014

I. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF

Name:                   Broadcast, Entertainment, Cinematograph & Theatre Union (BECTU)

Register ID Number:     BECTU is affiliated to Euro-MEI but is not itself an organisation registered in
                        the Interest Representative Register. We understand that BECTU’s
                        submission will be published separately.

Type of respondent:

BECTU is a trade union of approximately 24,000 members, and is a representative of rights
holders, authors ,independent producers and contributing authors in the film, broadcast and
theatre industries in the UK as well as representing a significant number of employees working in
those industries.

BECTU supports a clear and robust copyright framework and supports strong enforcement of
rights, particularly internet based copyright theft, because of its impact on employment in the
creative industries and on the quality of cultural life.


                                      RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS

II.   RIGHTS AND FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET

Online services and multi-territorial licensing (Q1-7)

Q3 How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and
the type of content concerned.

As authors working in the film, broadcast and theatre sectors, the majority of our rights holder
members do not license “end product”, whether analogue, digital or online for distribution in the
single market. They are contribute creative works to that “end product”, so they have no
experience of providing online services, or of multi-territorial licensing. This makes it difficult for
BECTU to respond directly to these questions.

However, we would point out that a far greater problem for those employed by, or working in the
film and television industry, is easy access to illegal content and the impact which this has on our

                                                 1
members’ livelihoods, their rights and, in turn, the wider impact this has on the longer term
viability of the film and television industries and on the production and development of new
works and services in that sector.

Q5 [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question,
you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider
(in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
countries)?

YES. As far as the television and film industry is concerned, cross border licensing already takes place
within the European Union. Where issues do arise they are not due to copyright but are related to
cultural or language differences. From a consumer perspective, problems are more likely to relate to
the limitations of online retail technology, or restrictions due to exchange rates, or taxation, than
they are to do with copyright.

Making available online (Q8-9)

Q8 Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO. Making available of works electronically or by wire or wireless means should be understood
to take place in both the country from which a transmission emanates and all countries where the
content transmitted can be accessed (not just those that are ‘targeted’ by a website). We support
the more detailed submission on this matter made by the British Copyright Council, of which we
are a member.

Q9 Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect
on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not,
whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not) on your remuneration, or on
the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

YES. The making available right is of increasing importance to our rights holder members and we
think that clarification could be helpful. We do not support any changes to the right which would
weaken the right.

In the context of the recognition of rights, application of the making available right affects the
generation of remuneration for private copying and cable retransmission rights or for other forms
of commercial electronic relays by parties who are not responsible for the original “making
available”.

Two Rights involved in a single act of exploitation (Q10)

Q10 [In particular if you are a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download )
create problems for you?

NO. Licensing different rights together is normal in many fields of copyright licensing, not just
online. It is done efficient and there is no problem in practice.
Linking and browsing (Q11 & 12)

Q11 Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
YES. in certain circumstances. BECTU members are concerned about sites that link to illegal content
and which, potentially, are making money, from that illegal content. Such links should be more
clearly seen as authorising a breach of copyright.
Resale of digital files (Q13-14)

Q13 [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
NO. Responses to this question must be balanced against responses to question 14.

Q14   [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences
of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please
specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The practical consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content would be that:

(a) re-sellers might not destroy originals and this could not be policed, effectively giving free rein to
piracy;

and

(b) the resold file would be identical to the original resulting in prices for the original files being
driven down inexorably.
This would be incompatible with international law because removing digital resale from rights holder
authorisation would involve creating new copyright exceptions to the reproduction and
communication to the public rights. Neither are compatible with the Three Step Test as this is not a
“special” case (i.e. it does not have a narrow scope), it conflicts with normal exploitation and prejudices
the legitimate interests of rights holders.

Voluntary registration system (Q15-19)

Q15 Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

NO. We can see no value in a registration system either voluntary or otherwise.

Q19 What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases.

On behalf of the individual rights holders and SMEs that we represent, we would like the
Commission’s role to be encouragement, provision of expertise and clear guidance, to support
development of standard identifiers through funding and to improve sanctions to prevent the
removal of metadata.
III.   LIMITATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS IN THE SINGLE MARKET (Q21-63)

Q21 Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States

The fact that most exceptions are optional is not, in itself, a problem. Problems arise from
interpretation of the Directives at national level e.g. private copying in the UK.

Q23 Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

NO. No new limitations or exceptions should be added. The existing catalogue is satisfactory. It
may be the case that consumer and users could benefit from their better application at national
level.

User Generated Content (Q58-63)

Q58 (c)    Have you experienced problems resulting from the way that users are using pre-
existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including
across borders?

NO. Such use can and should be licensed as an adaptation, or in the same way as any other copy
of a work. As far as rights holders are concerned, the main issue is that some websites and
services which carry such material, have taken out licences from rights holders to carry user
generated content, while others are not.

Q60 (a)     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you experienced
problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works)?

The first problem is that User Creators frequently do not understand what they have created so
don’t understand that they have rights.

The main difficulty for User Creators and for many individual professional creators, performers and
other smaller rights holders is that they do not know when their work is used and they have no
means to monitor or police the market. Even where they can identify infringements they have
insufficient resources (financial or otherwise) to pursue infringers.

IV.    PRIVATE COPYING AND REPROGRAPHY (Q64-71)

Q64 In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment.

YES, in relation to private copying. It is difficult for BECTU to comment on this at the present time,
While BECTU, like other rights holders in the UK, is in favour of a limited private copying
exception which provides fair compensation, it seems likely that the UK Government will shortly
introduce an exception for private copying with no fair compensation for rights holders. BECTU,
therefore, asks the European Commission to intervene to clarify the scope and application of any
private copying exception, so that there is parity of treatment and fair remuneration for all
authors and performers across Europe.
V.    FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS (Q72-74)

Q72 [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of
mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?

BECTU supports a strong framework of law around copyright and moral rights but we also support
fair payment for use, fair contract terms particularly around copyright ownership and which,
particularly in the film and television industry where we assignment of copyright from the author to
the film producer is the norm, terms which ensure the creator has an on-going interest in his or her
work and on-going payment for the use of that work, in an industry in which licensing models are
increasingly “long-tail”.

BECTU encourages the European Commission to review moral rights and the need for
harmonization of these rights which have an increased value for copyright users as well as for
rights holders in the internet environment. The right to be identified as the author has additional
value with regard to orphan works, while the integrity right helps to maintain and authenticate
works.

Q73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

YES
Q74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address
the shortcomings you identify?
BECTU supports parity of treatment for authors cross national boundaries.

On behalf of certain of its members, BECTU wishes to raise one concern here about the
recognition of certain of our members’ rights and their entitlement to fair remuneration.. BECTU is
seeking recognition and parity of treatment for cinematographers and film editors which are,
recognised as authors in some EU Member States and are entitled to remuneration and respect
for their rights as authors. This is not the case in the UK. This is a more general concern and not
related directly to more general concerns about fair treatment and fair remuneration for rights
holders. We would argue that uneven recognition of authors distorts the single market, resulting
in issues around remuneration, particularly in secondary markets. The true scope of creative
authorship should be recognised and rewarded across the EU and we would welcome debate
around this issue..

VI    RESPECT FOR RIGHTS (Q75-77)

Q75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

YES. The civil enforcement system should be rendered more efficient and the legal framework is
not sufficiently clear. In this context, BECTU supports the detailed submission made by the UK’s
Alliance for IP which states:-
 “Ensure that Article 8(3) is properly implemented in all Member States. The UK implemented Art
 8(3) via section 97A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Using this provision rights
 owners in the UK have successfully blocked over xxx websites which were causing significant damage
  to legitimate businesses by distributing or linking to illegal content. Such injunctive relief, as
  required by the Directive, is not available in all Member States. This makes the ability of rights
  owners to enforce their rights inconsistent.

  Ensure rights owners are able to access the injunctive relief provided for in 8(3) at a speed
  which is necessary to stop the harm the infringement is causing. This is of particular important
  in stances of illegal streaming of live content. For rights owners such as the UK Premier League
  the value in their content is in its live nature. Therefore, they need to be able to stop an illegal
  stream extremely quickly.
  Create an EU-wide centre of excellence dealing with online IP infringement. The cross-border
  nature of online crime creates challenges for law enforcement. The UK realised this on a national
  level (responsibility for IP crime traditionally lying with regional trading standards units) and created
  a national Police IP Crime Unit (PIPCU). Operating out of the City of London Police this unit is
  dedicated to combatting online IP crime. In the short time it has been operationally it has already
  achieved significant success. However, just as online IP crime doesn’t respect UK local authority
  boundaries, neither does it respect national boundaries. A dedicated centre within Europol or
  the EU Observatory on the Infringement of IP Rights tasked with pulling together intelligence
  would greatly increase law enforcement and rights owners’ ability to stop this criminal activity.

  Introduce model rules for small claims proceedings. The UK has introduced an enhanced fast
  claims track for small claims which is designed to makes the court process cheaper and easier. It
  de-formalises the process and allows parties involved to participate without lawyers. Smaller
  companies often feel excluded from the legal system and find enforcing their rights too costly
  and time consuming. The EU must ensure that companies of all sizes have access to justice.

  Work to improve the system of notice and take down. Alliance members report that while
  social media sites such as Facebook at reporting and take down processes, they are generally too
  slow and it can sometimes take several weeks to remove offending items.”

Q76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with
a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

Again, BECTU supports the submission of the Alliance for IP:-

  “The ease with which people can find and access illegal content online remains a huge problem
  for rights holders and legal online services. We believe there is a valuable role for the EU to play
  in ensuring the online environment is one which is safe for consumers and fair for businesses.

  Intermediaries are important partners in tackling infringement:

  - Search engines enable fraudsters to attract Internet users to their sites offering access to illegal
  digital content

  - Illegal peer-2-peer filesharing of copyright protected content is continuing

  - Online sites are hosting or facilitating the online distribution of protected works without the
  consent of rights owners
     - Advertisers are serving adverts to illegal sites thereby providing these infringers with
     much-needed revenue

     - Payment service providers are allowing their services to be used in to purchase illegal
     content

     There are a number of measures the Commission could implement which would not
     require the Enforcement Directive to be reopened but would have a positive impact on
     rights owners ability to protect their content from commercial infringers.

     Clarify against whom injunctions are possible. The development of the Internet has
     led to more services potentially fall into the Enforcement Directive’s definition of
     intermediary. The Commission should make it clear that injunctions are possible against
     all of these parties. This would not impact on the rule around liability and would not
     require a review of the safe harbours provisions under the E-Commerce Directive. It is
     vital, however, as rights owners need to be able to seek appropriate injunctive relief from
     those entities best placed to stop infringing activity.

     Encourage the development of voluntary arrangements. The UK is seeing significant
     success with the creation of voluntary agreements between intermediaries and rights
     owners. For example, collaborative work between rights owners, law enforcement and
     the advertising industry has seen a reduction of x% of adverts being served to pirate
     websites. Similar work is underway with the payment service providers.

     Require domain registries to have in place robust data verification procedures.
     While it is relatively easy to identify the ISP used to host an infringing website, problems
     often arise in finding out who is actually responsible for the site itself. Inadequate checks
     are undertaken by domain registrars to confirm that the registrant’s information, personal
     and financial, is correct. The Commission should also work with ICANN to ensure the
     information on the WHOIS database is correct and up to date.”



V.      A SINGLE EU COPYRIGHT TITLE (Q78-79)

Q78 Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

NO. We do not think this is necessary.
