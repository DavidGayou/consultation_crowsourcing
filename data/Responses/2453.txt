II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
   A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
      anywhere in Europe?


   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
   provide online services across borders in the EU?

   Cross border library services, e.g. document delivery to other (EU)-countries: Germany allows
   – under specific conditions - (digital) document delivery in its § 53a UrhG. Concerning
   delivery to other (EU-) countries, the situation gets more complicated: To act legally,
   document delivery by libraries would have to be permitted also in the country of direction.
   The directive 2001/29/EC in Art. 5.2 c) doesn´t harmonize the conditions for document
   delivery.

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why,
   even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
   question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the
   service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than
   the one he is trying to access)?

    Please explain by giving examples
   Libraries as service provider – e.g. in the field of document delivery or provider of digital
   images online, don´t find it necessary to impose territorial restrictions.

   7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
   solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
   services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
   holders?

   YES – Please explain
   Full harmonization of document delivery provisions, either in a directive or a regulation.
   Libraries, to compete in their more and more transnational environment, have to be sure that
   what is allowed in their country (of origin) is allowed also in the country of destination.



8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required
(e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23)
Libraries, to compete in the international environment, have to be sure that what is allowed in
their country (of origin) is allowed also in the country of destination – at least within EU. That
would not necessarily mean that the right of “making available” has to be defined more precisely,
but that the respective exceptions to the “making available” right have to be harmonized – e.g. the
exception to make available for research reasons (Art.5.3 Infosoc-directive). This applies also to
other exceptions: What makes cross border services and making available on the internet difficult,
is that only the exploitation rights of the rightsholder are fully harmonized, but not the respective
exceptions. But exceptions and limitations of copyright are the scope in which libraries` activities
take place: Lending, making available for research, document delivery etc..


10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights
to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?
YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems
(e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the
"bundling of rights")
Art. 5.3 n) Infosoc-directive allows the communication and making available on dedicated
terminals. The making available of printed works requires their digitization, that means, a
reproduction. In Germany, there still is uncertainty if the reproduction for these purposes is also
allowed. It is subject to a lawsuit, in whose course this question was posed to the ECJ. In national
laws, in this and similar cases, it should be clearly formulated that with respect to the specific
exception, all relevant exhaustion rights are limited (e.g. making available AND the
reproduction). This case shows that national legislation on exceptions that implement exceptions
of the Infosoc-directive can be problematic. For this reason, exceptions should be fully
harmonized.


11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public
– or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

Hyperlinks are inherent parts of the world wide web. There is no reason to subject them to the
authorization of the rightsholder: It is only a reference to a document, not a case of “making
available” in its own right. Linking is not copying.




13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
Libraries face a big problem here, because the application of the first sale doctrine on e-Books is
at least uncertain. In the “usedsoft” case, ECJ decided that downloaded software can be resold
under specific conditions. In libraries, the legal limbo about the exhaustion of e-books leads to a
use only within the licence terms: Copyright limitations in practice don´t apply any more. This is
a general problem in the digital world: Exceptions and limitations are overridden by licence
agreements. Libraries act only in the framework of the licence, because it is unclear whether the
statutory law is mandatory or not. Therefore, we suggest that every limitation in the directive
2001/29/EC should be mandatory in a double sense: Implemention of the limitations (including
first sale doctrine) should be mandatory for the member states and they should be obliged to
implement the exception in their national copyright laws in a mandatory form so they cannot be
overridden by licence agreements which mostly are business terms formulated by the rightsholder.
Additionally, rightsholder shall not be allowed to use technical protection measures (TPM´s) in
the scope of exception and limitation usage. Using TPM´s to protect works which are in the public
domain should be prohibited.




14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
One of the background issues of the exhaustion principle is to limit the exclusive rights of copyright
holders after first distribution. Thus, the principle guarantees free access to information resources. In
the digital world, rights holders have the (technical) ability to control every distribution and even to
prevent further distribution by first acquirers of the resources by TPMs. At present, even TPMs are
protected by Art. 6 of the “Infosoc” directive. There is no ECJ decision on the applicability of first sale
doctrine on copyright materials except for software. This causes uncertainty among content providers
like libraries.

Libraries guarantee free access to information. This is important on the one hand for the general
public, it is a prerequisite for the (democratic) right to take part in any discussion. On the other hand it
is vital for purposes of study and research. If the distribution of resources is under control even after
first sale of information resources, the possibilities of distributing information resources change
dramatically: Reasonable information supply for the public and researchers which traditionally was –
apart from publishers and booksellers – provided by libraries, cannot be guaranteed any more if all
distribution channels are fully controlled by publishers and database vendors. There should be a
reasonable limitation of exclusive distribution rights parallel to what exists in the analogue world.

Electronic (online downloadable) research information will soon be more prevalent than analogue
resources, in science and technology this is already the case. Imagine researchers who have to use
hundreds of (electronic) scholar resources for their dissertation and libraries cannot provide access to
these works. That can happen: Some providers don´t sell their electronic books or journals to libraries
any more. A researcher cannot afford to buy access to these resources on his or her own cost. Only
(University and research-) libraries can provide easy and reasonable access to all these resources.
Concerning analogue resources, the first sale doctrine enables access even if these resources are too
expensive for that specific library or are out of commerce: They can be provided by (international)
inter-library loan, if another library is in possession of that book or article copy. If this principle does
not apply for downloadable materials – which in future will be clearly the main part of all research
material (often high price materials), research and study can be affected severely. Resources will be
under full control of publishers, vendors and their various, sometimes hard-to-handle business terms.

A legal framework would help to maintain reasonable access to the resources researchers need –
keeping in mind the (structural) monopolies in copyright (there is mostly only one (exclusive)
rightsholder). This is also important for compatibility and resource access of EU countries with
finance problems. To prevent piracy and distribution which can damage the legitimate interests of the
rightsholders, there should be established reasonable and clear conditions for deletion of other copies
analog to the ECJ “usedsoft” judgement.
15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

YES

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

Like in the system of orphan works already established, this could help to exploit certain kind of
works. In Germany, besides the orphan works register, there is being established a registration
system for out of print works.
In general, registers help e.g. cultural or research institutions, but also private persons or
publishers to exploit works: It is easier to get information on the copyright status: In general,
exploitation of works should be facilitated.

Apart from the search for rights holders, copyrights registers – in the long term – should be a
condition for claiming exclusive rights on exploitation. In detail, this effect could be limited to
some rights and only to already published works: For non-registered published works, the making
available and distribution for non commercial purposes should be allowed. In general, content or
service providers face difficulties to find rightsholders or even define the copyright status (e.g. if
copyright term has already expired). This could be much easier if rightsholders who are interested
in exploiting the works had to register within 5 years after first publishing. Furthermore, in lack of
renewal of registration every 5 years, exclusive exploitation rights would expire. The other way
around, in this central register, copyright holders should be able to waive some or all of their
exploitation rights or grant rights to the public for all (or only for non commercial) purposes.
Rightsholders should be compensated by collective payment, even if they are not registered any
more and the works are exploited within the copyright term.
This system – under the current international treaties – can only be provided on a national level.
EU should advocate the permission on international level, to make it part of the respective
agreements.

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Possible users could get confused of the function of such an instrument, if registering (or not
registering) does not make any difference for the copyright status.

On the other hand, a register that does have an effect on the copyright status, would impute
obligations on a creator who wants to prevent the exploitation of his rights. Certain restrictions of
the use even of non-registered works could limit this disadvantage to a reasonable level (see
above: Application only for published works, only non commercial use). The term “non-
commercial” would have to be clearly defined.


19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?
EU could support interoperability and use by extending the information provided in EUROPEANA
metadata or the data provided in a copyright register: All metadata, all access points in a standardized
format (already provided in Europeana metadata standards)



20. Are the current copyright terms still appropriate in the digital environment ?

No
Copyright terms often prevent the distribution of information. Many creators have no interest in the
commercial exploitation of their works. Their interest is to inform the public or their research
community. Many creators wish to give broad access to their works and let the public or research
community use their work, as long as they are not affected in their moral rights. This applies, e.g., to
comments or articles in weblogs – or more generally – to many scientists. So, a copyright term of
maximum 50 years after death or even less would seem more appropriate. Essential instrument of
copyright protection would be a register as explained above (Question 16).



21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Example: Cross – border – library services: As there is no harmonization of the rules for (digital)
document delivery, libraries would have to know about the legal situation in the state of
destination. National copyright limitations often concern technical details. Information
instruments and practices change frequently. This leads to legal insecurity and legal limbos. Often
the library practices are subject to lawsuits. Uncertainty often has the consequence that services
are not provided because of fear of being sued. In a transnational environment the practice is
extremely complicated. In practice, this leads to licensing instead of confidence in the statutory
exceptions. This affects the power balance between publishers and the public.
Another example is the provision of research environments in online universities: Students in
these universities are based in various countries. Thus, documents have to be provided to students
who live in other jurisdictions. If this is prevented by the legal situation or even because of the
legal uncertainty, foreign students will be discriminated against. This situation is not compatible
with the EU principles of a common market and common educational systems.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Libraries or educational institutions providing cross-border-services like document delivery or
research environments have to know what is allowed in their own country and in the country of
destination of these services. This is why we need a) full harmonization of exceptions and b)
exceptions that cannot be overridden by licence agreements.
23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

         •    Text and data mining for all research purposes;
         •    An exception to ensure that nothing in a contract undermines limitations and exceptions
              in copyright law;
         •    Legal certainty for e-lending by libraries analogous to analogue e-lending;
         •    A new preservation exception allowing preservation networks between institutions
              (currently most preservation exceptions relate to preserving material in your own
              collection, rather than having digital mirror sites and activities between institutions);
         •    Publicly funded research results openly available regardless of contracts signed with a
              publisher;
         •    Research exceptions making no distinction between commercial and non-commercial
              purposes.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES – Please explain why
…to a certain extent. The U.S, system shows that certain uses which might serve the public
should be allowed in a fair use condition. This could be provided additionally to the existing
catalogue.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open
norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages
of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

The United States, Israel, Singapore and South Korea have an exception known as ‘fair use’. Rather
than allowing a pre-defined activity, it is a test that can be applied to any activity that uses a copyright
work to see if it undermines the legitimate interests of a rightsholder or not. A similar law is just one
possible solution to the current situation in Europe.

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a
problem?

YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
cross border uses, see Question 21.

32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote
access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research
and private study? Yes, frequently.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question] Fully harmonizedmandatory exceptions for document delivery and making
available in research environments.
36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying
to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders,
of books or other materials held in your collection? Yes, frequently.


37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question] Mandatory limitations, see above, Question 13

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question] see above, Question 13; in the digital world, rights concerning the resources get
more unclear / diversified. There is much legal uncertainty, because it is unclear if statutory law or
licence applies. Licences are not standardized, so that hundreds of different agreements can rule
the use of the various library resources – instead of one statutory law.

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’
traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as
off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you
encountered?

[Open question] uncertainty, see Question 13

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e.
the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect
so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

NO – Please explain
Not any more. A law on out-of-print-works is in force since Jan. 2014.

NO OPINION
41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types
of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

YES – Please explain
Especially for works with multiple rights holders or collections, newspapers or journals: In mass
digitization projects, the work to register every single work (e.g. newspaper articles) in the
register would be too much work and therefore impede digitization. Registration is obligatory
according to the respective German law, §§ 13 e and f UrhWahrnG.



47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders? Yes, online research environments, see
above.
E. Data Mining
54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By a mandatory exception for reproduction and use of the mining results. Researchers must be able to
share the results of text and data mining, as long as these results are not substitutable for the original
copyright work - irrespective of copyright law, database law or contractual terms to the contrary.
Without this right, legal uncertainty may prevent important research and data driven innovation
putting researchers, institutions and innovators at risk.


55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Data mining works by copying large quantities of material, extracting the data, and recombining it to
identify patterns, trends and hypotheses or by providing the means to organize the information mined.
All this should be permitted by a mandatory exception for text and data mining.


IV Private copying and reprography
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

YES – Please explain
For cross-border-use, e.g. document delivery, it should be defined that this can be done for private
use (this term then has to be defined on an EU level). The exception should be mandatory.

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject
to private copying levies?59
No. Private use should be allowed by mandatory exception, but personal use should be free of
every levy.
