PRELIMINARY REMARKS


Yahoo is focused on making the world's daily habits more inspiring and entertaining.
By creating highly personalized experiences for our users, we keep people
connected to what matters most to them, across devices and around the world. In
turn, we create value for advertisers by connecting them with the audiences that build
their businesses. Yahoo is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, USA, and has
offices located throughout the Americas, Asia Pacific (APAC) and the Europe, Middle
East and Africa (EMEA) regions. For more information, visit the pressroom
(pressroom.yahoo.net) or the company's blog (yodel.yahoo.com).


Our response refers to several Yahoo consumer products and services offered in
Europe, namely: the now-defunct Yahoo Music, Yahoo News Search (in particular,
the Yahoo Germany offering), Yahoo Answers, and Yahoo Groups. Yahoo Music
offered radio and music streaming and other related music content free to users.
Yahoo News Search helps users find breaking news stories and in-depth coverage
with videos and photos. Yahoo Answers is a way to find and share information. Users
can ask questions on any topic, get answers from real people, and share insights and
experience. Yahoo Groups is an online opportunity to share with a group of friends,
interests and communities.


Yahoo is a member of both the Computer and Communications Industry Association
(CCIA) and the European Digital Media Association (EDiMA) and endorses and
supports the responses those organisations have made in connection with this
consultation. Where we have not provided specific answers herein, we are supportive
of the answers provided by these organisations. In addition, we as Yahoo have
information and experience we believe may be useful to those considering the
current and potential future copyright regime and rules in Europe, and welcome the
opportunity to share that information and experience here.

    II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
!
Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]

A.2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
when seeking to provide online service across borders in the EU?
YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or
to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

YES, we have experienced problems when seeking to provide online service across
borders in the EU. Such problems are often (but not always) related to copyright
issues. Other challenges include the lack of a harmonised EU-wide legal framework
for consumer protection, personal rights and youth protection, among others.

Examples where copyright issues have been particularly problematic for us in the
provision of pan-European services include:

    1) Music works licensing
    2) German ancillary copyright law
    3) Different local law definitions for copyright fair use or limitations and
       exceptions
    4) Premium video content

1) Music works licensing

The online distribution and exploitation of music has historically followed a very
different pattern from other content types. There are a number of structural reasons
why the market has developed this way and it remains one of the most difficult
content types on which to build a successful digital distribution business.

We acknowledge that the Commission has sought to take measures that are
designed to address some of the problems in digital music. In particular, we note with
interest the recent adoption of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial
licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the internal market (the

           Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules           3
“Directive”). The Directive includes provisions that we hope will help alleviate some of
the difficulties associated with music licensing (most notably, by requiring collecting
societies to be accountable). However, the issues we highlight below will continue to
present challenges for our business.

Potential distributors of digital audio and video music face a number of barriers.
These include:

Industry Concentration – As the major record labels have consolidated into fewer
labels over time, those labels have increasing negotiating leverage and are in a
position to dictate terms, both economic and non-economic. Major labels and,
sometimes, conglomerations of independent labels, routinely insist on “Most
Favoured Nation” provisions in their agreements, or other provisions which by their
nature have a similar effect. This behaviour has the effect of levelling commercial
terms across the major labels, ensuring that each major label gets the maximum
licensing royalties. Consolidation across the major publishers has had a similar
effect.

Pricing – Licensee fees are high relative to returns currently available from
advertising revenue. This is particularly true for audio ad markets, which in the
broadcasting world consisted of local ad markets. Licence fees are typically based on
a fixed royalty per stream and can sometimes be subject to other minimums. For
audio on-demand services, the overall licensing costs could be as much as 80% or
more of revenues, before any other operating costs are factored in. Assuming master
use rights are granted by a label, in the event of a dispute with a collecting society
over royalty rates for public performances, the only alternative is to challenge
onerous royalty positions through a legal process. The cost base within the music
industry as a whole remains high, and these are typically passed through the value
chain. Other costs contribute to high prices, including the presence of a large number
of intermediaries in the licensing process. Thus, rights holders typically benefit most
from growing audiences and the licensee bears the cost and risk of developing
services that are attractive to consumers.

Multiple licences are necessary for one piece of content - Music is the only
content type that always involves multiple rights holders (thus potentially multiple
contracts and multiple payments). Other forms of content licensed for digital
distribution typically involve one contract and one payment, with the licensor
managing payments to the original contributors and creators itself. For example,
licensing audio-visual content typically only requires a licence from the content
owner, who takes responsibility for remunerating contributors.

Complexity of rights – The current framework of rights (master use, mechanical,
public performance, synch, etc.) is a legacy of the way in which the music publishing
and recording industries evolved in the offline world, but this model has changed little
and this system sits uncomfortably with the leaner model of digital distribution; it adds
significant costs to the point that digital offerings can be uncompetitive compared with
offline equivalents.

Transaction costs and other overhead – Licensees bear significant costs as a
result of negotiating and administering licences with music labels; launching a digital

          Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules        4
music offering can involve hundreds of licence agreements. Licensees also have to
conclude agreements with collecting societies – over 30 in the EU alone – in order to
obtain licences and pay the royalties due. At the time Yahoo licensed music in the
EU (as explained in greater detail below), this involved four licences with the big
music labels, many more with small, independent labels (“indies”), multiple collecting
societies and music publishers. In addition to licensing, the engineering costs
associated with hosting content and measuring streams are also more significant
than for other content types. The required methods for measuring streams are
typically bespoke rather than industry standard and this adds cost, particularly if
different labels require different methods. Implementing reporting mechanisms such
as DDEX can be cost-prohibitive in the case of certain types of service.

Burdensome licence terms – Music is the only content type where licensees are
required to provide reporting and auditing occurs at the individual file level as
opposed to the aggregated content of each licensor. The common measurement
systems require tracking per stream and per track on audio and video content.
Licences require data to be retained for several years after a licence is terminated
and it is not unusual for labels to request audits of streams that stretch back to prior
years. Such terms are cumbersome and add cost. Licences are also tied to particular
platforms, with the effect that a distributor will need multiple licences to cover all
platforms they use, and the scope of licences are not consistent across labels so this
makes it difficult to offer a full-repertoire service across all platforms. This also makes
it difficult for licensees to manage costs as they explore distribution on new platforms
because the execution of this strategy typically requires new contractual
arrangements with a different pricing structure. In addition, rights holders sometimes
insist on concluding different licence agreements for different services run by the
same licensee. The contracting process when negotiating licences for digital music
can be protracted and expensive, often requiring legal expertise in local markets.

Territoriality – Advertising-funded business models rely on reach and scale to offset
the low margins. The current system requires licensees to negotiate rights deals in
each individual territory for the same music rather than negotiate a single, multi-
territory licence under a single contract and at a price that reflects the going rate of
advertising sales on the open market. This is inherently inefficient. While we note that
the implementation of the Directive may lead collecting societies to more often jointly
license their repertoires, concluding multiple licence agreements will still remain a
considerable burden.

Negotiating power – Although Yahoo is an international corporation with a
significant market capitalisation and associated resources, the scope and
concentration of major rights holders in digital music is such that, even for larger
corporations, it is extremely difficult to obtain better licence terms. We generally
welcome the provisions in the Directive that seek to implement local mediation
measures to help regulate unfair royalty rates.

Yahoo Music Example - Yahoo stopped directly licensing music in Europe in early
2009 as a result of these barriers, as explained in further detail here. Yahoo Music
operated for a number of years in all our major EU markets. It was an advertising-
supported service, previously offering radio and music video streaming and other
music content free to the end-user. The EU audience in January 2009 was 15 million

          Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules          5
unique users.

In Europe, Yahoo licensed radio and video repertoire as far as possible via pan-
European or global deals with record labels to host and stream audio and video. In
addition to a variety of technological restrictions and reporting requirements, the
terms of these deals typically required Yahoo to license a label’s entire repertoire
(rather than only the artists/tracks that we knew to be most popular and easiest to
monetise), and to provide a guaranteed advance and per stream minima.

In addition, per stream royalties were due to local collecting societies (sometimes
more than one) in each market under the terms of the licence. In the UK, payments
were made to PRS for Music. Separate agreements had to be concluded with each
relevant collecting society in each market, and in addition, with other societies that
pulled their repertoire out for multi-country arrangements. The per stream royalty was
fixed (e.g.: flat rate % or fee), with no discount for volume. This is the only content
type for which there is only one business model and very limited flexibility to
negotiate on price.

The licences also required regular reporting to the collecting society on the identity
and number of streams consumed. This involved developing bespoke technical
solutions to measure audience and these were supported by Yahoo Europe’s
engineering resource at a cost of approximately US$600k per annum. These costs
had to be recovered via advertising sales.

These reporting requirements were subject to periodic auditing by PRS for Music.
Where these audits were not satisfactory to PRS for Music, it frequently sought legal
remedies from Yahoo. Yahoo also had recourse to the UK Copyright Tribunal in 2005
to challenge the per stream royalties set by PRS for Music. Although the Tribunal
acknowledged many aspects of Yahoo’s complaint, Yahoo and the various other
complainants in the case did not prevail in the action.

Different licences were typically required for different platforms (e.g.: mobile versus
PC) and for different types of service (e.g.: streaming vs. download, video vs. radio
vs. download). This required Yahoo to negotiate and administer multiple licences with
the same entities and rights holders, as well as other rights holders (over 20 at a time
was not unusual). As Yahoo sought to expand its service on to new platforms and
new markets, the licensing structure required us to negotiate new contracts and
prices for each new platform and new market. Arrangements with relevant local
collecting societies mirrored these challenges.

This onerous licensing and auditing framework required Yahoo to employ a full time,
specialist specifically for EU music licensing deals beyond the 5 full-time music
lawyers and paralegals that normally handled such matters globally. This was the
only product in Yahoo Europe’s portfolio that generated sufficient bureaucracy to
require such an approach. The music service required a disproportionate number of
staff relative to other content services, mainly as a result of the contractual
arrangements with record labels and requirements set by music publishers.

Ultimately, Yahoo never concluded agreements for a subscription music and
download service outside the US as a direct result of the cost structure combined

          Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules       6
with the inability to extend its US licences to additional territories without separate
negotiations with labels and publishers. It is noteworthy that there are several
successful music services operating in the US that have yet to make it to Europe,
including the likes of Pandora, Slacker and Songza.

Moreover, Yahoo’s US subscription on demand and download services were also
dramatically impeded by the major label requirement at the time that all digital
download providers use Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM created
interoperability barriers based on the operating system, since Yahoo’s service was
Windows-based and the tracks could not be used on Apple products. DRM prevented
consumers from freely using and transferring lawfully purchased music between their
computers and devices.

In December 2008, Yahoo Europe’s business leaders concluded that audio and
video streaming of music on this basis was not a viable long-term business model
without a more flexible licensing framework. In early 2009, we withdrew from licence
agreements worth US$4.6m per annum to the music labels and removed US$2.5m
per annum of costs in the form of collecting society dues and internal overheads
(staff, engineering, legal, administration, etc.).

Yahoo On the Road Concert Tour Example – A more recent example of the
challenges inherent in offering music across Europe arose in connection with
Yahoo’s “On the Road” Concert Tour last year. In addition to numerous operational
negotiations and planning challenges around matters such as venues, production,
artist appearances, and sponsorships, this mobile entertainment and innovation
festival required multiple sets of negotiations across Europe. The experience
underscores the complicated nature of music licensing. The tour required:
    • Licence agreements with record labels (who own the rights in the master
       copies of the tracks played) for use at the concerts and for live streaming and
       Video On Demand (VOD) clips on Yahoo;
    • Synch rights licence agreements with publishers (who represent the authors
       and composers of the tracks played) for use at the concerts and for live
       streaming and VOD clips on Yahoo;
    • Royalties licence agreements with collecting societies for use at the concerts
       and for live streaming and VOD clips on Yahoo;
    • Specific live stream footage agreement for a licence of the raw live feed
       footage being filmed by MTV (Wireless only);
    • On the ground legal clearance work with artists who only gave their consent to
       be live streamed/VODd on Yahoo on the day of the performance or having
       watched the performance (Wireless only); and
    • Legal reviews of multi-market competitions, in particular where Vine video
       entries contain music footage.

2) Germany – Ancillary Copyright Law

Another copyright-related example that undermines provision of information-based
services throughout the EU is the so-called German “Ancillary Copyright Law.” On 1
August 2013, this law took effect in Germany. The new law limits search engine
providers and providers of similar services (e.g. news aggregators) to displaying only
“individual words” and/or “smallest text excerpts” of German press content, unless

          Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules      7
they have obtained respective licences from publishers. The law does not define
what “individual words” and/or “smallest text excerpts” mean, so these will need to be
determined by future case law.

Due to this new law Yahoo Germany changed its news content related search
service (Yahoo News Search) that we offer to German users. Given the uncertainty
of the scope of this new law and to avoid potential violations it was decided to only
display headers of German based content sources rather than headers and small
snippets.


3) Different local law definitions for copyright fair use or limitations and
exceptions

See responses to questions 21-23 below.

4) Premium video content licensing

Yahoo has also experienced major challenges licensing premium television video
content for multiple EU countries. For example, our German premium video content
licensing agreements usually limit our rights to use the content to German speaking
countries (Austria, Switzerland and Germany) or sometimes only in Germany. In
addition, IP blocking of foreign addresses is often contractually required. This is
clearly undesirable as it prevents us from making these services available to our
German-speaking users while they travel to other jurisdictions, even within the EU.




A.6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary
rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or
justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for
instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is
trying to access)?

YES – Please explain by giving examples
As noted previously, there are occasionally other issues such as a lack of
harmonised consumer protection laws, personal rights laws, youth protection and
other kinds of illegal content (or censorship) laws which may affect what can be
offered in any individual Member State, making EU-wide offerings difficult, and
therefore limiting what is available for consumers in a given Member State. There is
also some variation in how individual Member States interpret and analyse active
versus passive hosting status in connection with liability determinations, and some
inconsistencies around when injunctive relief may be imposed.

A.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]



B.3. Linking and browsing.

11. Should the provisions of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO. Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

No. Under no circumstance should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or
other subject matter fall under copyright protection.

The practice of hyperlinking not only serves as the backbone for how users engage
with the Internet, but it is also one of the most fundamental and basic activities of
Internet use. Linking is what makes the Internet a web, rather than a collection of
millions of discrete and unconnected sites. In fact, Yahoo’s story is inextricably tied to
offering hyperlinks. That history traces back to 1994.

Beginning as a personal hobby during their time at Stanford University, Jerry Yang
and David Filo (the founders of Yahoo) tracked their personal interest on the Internet
through a list of links. Eventually, Jerry and David's lists became too long and
unwieldy, so they began to parse them into categories and subcategories, and from
there, Yahoo’s portal concept took shape. The site started out as "Jerry and David's
Guide to the World Wide Web" but eventually received a new moniker: Yahoo, an
acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle." Today the portal is the one
of the leading destinations on the Web, with over 800 million visitors per month.

If offering hyperlinks to works required authorisation, these two electrical engineering
students would never have been able to transform their personal list of websites into
a portal that serves nearly a billion people every month. Likewise, a billion people
would be left without a starting place for their activity on the web.

Setting this personal history aside, requiring consent to insert a hyperlink minimizes
the web’s social and productive value. An examination of Yahoo’s news reporting
practices illustrates this point. When covering events and breaking news stories, our
online editorial teams rely on hyperlinks to supplement coverage, attribute sources,
suggest where readers can find multiple and nuanced sides to an event, identify
other stories where readers can further explore specific points, or even provide
context to a point made within the editorial. If hyperlinking becomes protected by
copyright, it would harm any one of those activities, in turn, limiting free expression.

          Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules         9
Imagine if a journalist had to ask a company for permission to offer a link to a press
release within an article that harshly criticises the company’s products; such
permission would be unlikely, and valid commentary would be suppressed in the
name of copyright. Consumers and EU citizens would lose valuable context that aids
their understanding of the news.

Requiring permission to offer hyperlinks has other profound consequences on
consumers; it would impact competition, pricing situations and social conversations.
A scan of the Yahoo Answers property demonstrates this fact. Yahoo Answers is an
online community in which participants ask and answer questions on a wide range of
topics. Users post and respond to the questions, and frequently offer links with a
response, for example:

Q: What is the best Anti-Virus Software? (posted Feb 21, 2014)
A: The best Anti-Virus software that I know of is [brand name]. You can find it Here:
[link]

Similarly a user might link to a hotel or restaurant they wish to recommend, or link to
a wide variety of additional, relevant, and otherwise freely available information about
people, places, websites and things. Further evidence of the social value links serve
can be seen within Yahoo Groups. Take, for example, a group dedicated to jazz fans
in London. If a user wanted to broadcast a post about an upcoming jazz show, a
prohibition on linking would preclude that user from sharing that information absent
consent. This is analogous to prohibiting card catalogues within libraries absent
express permission from the copyright owner of the books found in that library.
Without question, applying copyright law to hyperlinks would jeopardize the nature of
the Internet.

Yahoo incorporates and refers to CCIA’s response to this question for a more
detailed examination of the legal arguments.


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on
the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general
or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorization of the
rightholder?

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

No. The viewing of a webpage should not be subject to the authorisation of a
copyright holder, in any circumstance.

Generally speaking, browsing sites or using online services involves the creation of
multiple temporary copies as a necessary step in the process of viewing requested
content. What results is a web cache – a temporary storage of web documents
ranging from HTML pages to images. Absent this process, the cost of connecting to

         Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules         10
the Internet for many could be prohibitive and the utilitarian nature of the Internet
would suffer.

Traffic on the Web consumes more bandwidth than any other Internet service,
therefore any method that can reduce bandwidth requirements is particularly
welcome in parts of the world in which telecommunication services are expensive
and in which service is often provided on a cost per bit basis. Yahoo and other global
service providers rely on caching technology to dampen the impact of such
connectivity challenges.

Second, caching technology reduces the latency of wait times for users during their
browsing experience. Browsing on mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones
is, in part, manageable because of caching technology. Physical limitations such as
environment and location, as well as financial limitations, lead to variations in
bandwidth and latencies, but caching can help smooth such rough spots. This is
especially true with mobile bandwidth.

Converting its global portal into a more mobile friendly destination requires Yahoo to
rely on the widely accepted practice of caching in order for users to view and read
content. With mobile devices replacing traditional desktop connectivity, robbing users
of the ability to cache pages would dramatically impact innovation in this area.

Last, requiring permission for this technical process opens up unnecessary and
additional permissions. A user should not be subject to obtaining permissions from
rights holders simply because that user’s browser, mobile device, or other connected
device prepares a transient and incidental copy in the background. Ultimately, this
added burden on users has the capacity to stifle the flow of information and the
exchange of ideas on the Internet.

Yahoo would also like to point out that the exception to the reproduction right
contained in Article 5(1) of the Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society extends to
temporary copies made in the course of browsing the Internet.




         Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules     11
    III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
Member States?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

Yes. The incongruences among Member States regarding limitations and exceptions
present challenges to Internet providers, like Yahoo, that offer services cross-border.

On this point Yahoo has another personal story to share. Yahoo both generates
enormous amounts of copyrighted material and consumes or aggregates copyrighted
material produced by other firms and individuals. As a result, Yahoo understands and
has an interest in both sides of the copyright coin: the crucial importance of providing
incentives and rewards for creative intellectual effort; and the equally important goal
of providing the public at large and future creators convenient access to the fruits of
that intellectual effort. Yet, leaving optional how the second side of the coin is treated
among Member States not only disrupts the balance struck by this equation with
cross-border works, but also leads to a fragmented market. This problem is
particularly acute with regard to newly created rights.

First, a lack of uniform exceptions and limitations makes it difficult for Yahoo to gauge
the risk associated with new products and services that may squarely – and
appropriately rely on such exceptions and limitations. Because damages under
copyright can become massive, minor risks and uncertainties can derail investment
and innovation. The UK Government refers to this as a “very real problem for the
UK’s emerging digital businesses.”1

Second, the existence of differing limitations and exceptions among Member States
hampers news reporting and media, and thereby chills freedoms of expression – by
both individuals and the press. What should the outcome be if, in connection with the
preparation of a news story about a political party in France, Yahoo exercises certain
quotation exceptions available in France, but publicises that story to French-speaking
users in the UK, where quotation rights are more limited? Must the story be modified
in every market?

Online users are also subject to such uncertainty. Many users engage with user-
generated-content platforms to prepare works for exhibition across borders that, in
certain cases, incorporate pieces of existing works. Exceptions for quotations, news

           Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules         12
reporting, and parodies play a significant role in determining whether the “mash-up” is
legal in one State versus a neighbouring State.

And, third, optional limitations and exceptions can lead to the troubling development
of the creation of new rights. One example is the ancillary copyright, or
Leistungsschutzrecht, that was passed in Germany in 2013 and cited earlier in this
submission. We understand that other Member States have or are now considering
similar laws. There would be less room for such developments to take hold in
Member States if greater harmonisation existed with limitations and exceptions. In
turn, this would stave off further fragmentation within the EU market.


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

Harmonised exceptions would lead to clear benefits in the marketplace. It would
provide, in part, greater legal certainty, unleash innovation, and ensure equal
treatment for online user’s expressions embodied in a host of digital works.

Any approach to harmonisation must also be viewed within the context of the overall
aims of copyright policy, in particular, the aim of striking the appropriate balance and
flexibility to ensure room for innovative ideas and businesses, and to keep pace with
new information and communication technologies. The UK Government’s approach
serves as an example on this point. When examining the proposed reforms, the UK
Government specifically called out the fact that such measures “are aimed at clear
economic benefits through increased innovation and improved efficiency.”2 Yahoo,
therefore, encourages the Commission to examine harmonisation against the
backdrop of policy aims to ensure greater flexibility and balance in the system.

Echoing CCIA’s response, the need for mandatory exceptions should be assessed
taking into account whether:

    (1) there is a detrimental impact on the internal market;
    (2) fundamental rights and/or the public interest are a strong justification for the
        exception;
    (3) an underlying policy goal, such as economic growth and support for
        innovation, is better achieved at the EU level.


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

Exceptions should not be removed from the existing catalogue. Trimming the current
exceptions would disrupt the necessary balance within the copyright framework,
which seeks both to provide incentives and rewards for creative intellectual effort and

           Yahoo Response to Public Consultation on Review of EU Copyright Rules         13
to provide the public at large and future creators convenient access to the fruits of
that intellectual effort.

Rather, Yahoo encourages the Commission to consider new exceptions. Innovative
uses of works – for example, anti-plagiarism software and audio recognition tools –
and the proliferation of UGC works on global platforms, present challenges in light of
the current catalogue of exceptions and limitations. Content aggregation within the
online environment is another area that is ripe for guidance given its tremendous
social benefits. A flexible framework is critical to ensuring that the copyright system
keeps pace with innovation.

Yahoo believes that thought should be directed towards considering how open-ended
norms can be injected into the copyright framework to deal with new advancements
in technology. One crucial principle that should anchor any open-ended norms is that
of ‘balance.’ One approach to achieve this balance is to offer strong protections
against unauthorized non-transformative uses – consumptive or parasitic uses that
do not modify or enhance value of the underlying materials - yet, permit
transformative uses of copyrighted materials – uses that alter the meanings or
purposes of those materials or in other ways advance the public interest.


(III) E. Text and Data Mining

54. If there are problems [with respect to text or data mining methods,
including across borders, linked to copyright], how would they best be solved?

Text and data mining are not copyright events. Admittedly these terms may be
subject to a range of different interpretations, but most typically, they relate to
reading, research and analysing of materials that are already openly accessible
online. For example, Yahoo has a laboratory presence in Barcelona. Researchers
and academics affiliated with the Barcelona lab engage in text and data mining and
in the process, usually use the information gleaned to in turn create more information
and knowledge. Viewing, reading and analysing freely available data has never been
and should not now be subject to copyright law. The fruits of such activities offer
enormous social, cultural, innovative, scientific and economic benefits.
