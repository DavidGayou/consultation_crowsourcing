   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]





   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


X NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).



€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain

Cela devrait se faire dans l'autre  sens:  assurer  une  pleine  protection,
tout en facilitant, autant que faire se peut, l'accès trans-frontalier.

€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]





The act of “making available”





   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


X YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[2])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation





  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


€ NO OPINION


Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
 and why

Parceque tout possesseur d'un bien devrait - pour le moins  -  être  informé
de la mise à disposition (gratuite ou non) de ce bien par autrui.

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


€ NO OPINION


  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


Idem réponse 11.


  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content




  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples


Toute  oeuvre  numérque  légallement  acquise  n'est-elle  pas  légitimement
assortie de restrictions quand à sa cession à tiers ?.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]

Il n'y a jamais revente, vu que le vendeur peut conserver l'original.  Il  y
a tout au plus duplication non privée dont le produit est cédé  à  un  tiers
contre rémunération.

 Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?




  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers





  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]



  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X YES – Please explain

Et devraientt même être élargis  pour  permettre  à  l'écosystème  création-
consommation de prospérer.

€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


€ NO OPINION


  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market




21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
    Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


€ NO OPINION


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
    there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ X YES – Please explain


Seulement  si  la  protection  demeure  la  norme,  et  l'exception   ...une
exception.


€ NO OPINION



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or  removed  from
    the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


€ X NO


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide  for
    a greater degree of flexibility in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
    limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


X NO – Please explain why

Idem réponse 22.

€ NO OPINION


25. If yes, what would be the best approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
    (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions
    of  the  directives,  interpretations  by  the   Commission,   built-in
    flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the  relative
    advantages and disadvantages  of  such  an  approach  as  well  as  its
    possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
    experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


€ NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
    level were to have cross-border effect,  how  should  the  question  of
    “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
    exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

Preservation and archiving





28. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you

celles-là en raison de la frénésie de leur obsolescence programmée ?

[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
