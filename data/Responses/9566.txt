   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.

   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


[Open question]

1/ The lack of a harmonised framework for audiovisual authors’  remuneration
makes it impossible for their CMOs  to  offer  DSPs  pan-European  licences.
There is therefore an urgent need to  provide  audiovisual  authors  with  a
harmonised guarantee of remuneration for the online  exploitation  of  their
works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This should take the form  of  an
unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration (see answers  to  questions
about fair remuneration of  authors  and  performers),  enforced  through  a
scheme where CMOs are entrusted to collect the remuneration at the level  of
the final distributors.

In the audiovisual sector,  after  the  initial  transfer  of  the  authors’
making available right to the producer,  this  right  is  very  often  split
territorially and transferred again and again to  many  different  operators
such as sale agents, distributors, broadcasters, etc. The contractual  chain
back to authors is then so long, complex and easily broken  if  one  element
of the chain experience difficulties (e.g.  an  intermediary  going  out  of
business) that the authors rarely see a cent of any remuneration  linked  to
the exploitation of the work.

Collective management of the  right  to  remuneration  should  therefore  be
encouraged so as to guarantee that the online  exploitation  of  audiovisual
works will benefit their authors and be helpful to users who will  know  who
to get the licences from.

2/ Cooperation between audiovisual authors’ CMOs  should  be  encouraged  to
develop pan-European licences.

In this context, LITA welcomes the  12  April  2013  CJEU  judgments  (here)
against the Commission’s decision in the  CISAC  case  in  which  the  Court
concluded that the Commission had  not  adduced  sufficient  evidence  of  a
concerted practice between  CISAC  societies.  The  Court  suggested,  among
others, that cooperation between societies as regards  effective  monitoring
and enforcement against  unauthorised  exploitation  cannot  work  if  these
societies also compete in licensing.

3/ Another major problem in facilitating cross-border licensing of works  is
the way in which the system of tax treaties  operates  in  Europe.  The  tax
system on royalties makes it extremely complex to develop  initiatives  such
as FRAME as it remains within the scope of the network of  different  double
tax treaties. This raises three specific issues:

    - Different rates, required documentation and conditions are attached to
      each treaty;

    - Complex to operate and resolve problems: issues have to  be  addressed
      directly to  the  tax  authorities  in  other  countries  rather  than
      centrally. Response times can be very slow;

    -  The  administration  of  tax  returns  for  individuals  who  receive
      royalties from foreign societies can be very complex.

There is an urgent need for the Commission to come up with a fair answer  on
this issue of double-tax  treaties  in  order  to  facilitate  cross  border
availability of works.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

YES - Please explain

Legislative solutions:

European legislation is  needed  to  ensure  that  audiovisual  authors  are
remunerated for the online distribution of  their  works,  independently  of
the country of production  and  exploitation.  With  such  a  level  playing
field, authors’ collective management  organisations,  entrusted  to  manage
the making available remuneration of audiovisual authors could develop  one-
stop-shops  to  offer  a  single  licence   or   entry   point   to   online
operators.This  will,  in  turn,make  it  easier  for  them   to   pay   the
remuneration due to the European audiovisual authors of the works  in  their
catalogue. This must be  a  priority  for  the  Commission  to  ensure  that
audiovisual authors are remunerated for the on-demand exploitation of  their
works whatever the country  of  exploitation  (please  see  details  in  our
responses to Q.72-74 below).

In the digital age, there are so many opportunities to make works  available
to audiences that there is no excuse for a lack of effort by  producers  and
their distributors in exploiting works within their control.  An  obligation
of exploitation of the rights held (use it or lose it principle)  should  be
introduced to generate a strong incentive for these operators  to  make  the
works available. If there has been no exploitation of a work  for  a  period
of time, then the authors’ rights revert back to them and they  can  exploit
their rights themselves. This  would  also  help  unlock  cultural  heritage
works.

Finally, a reduced VAT rate for on-demand audiovisual works is  a  necessity
for the development and take-up of online services: only cinema tickets  and
broadcasting currently  benefit  from  a  reduced  VAT  rate  so  far.  When
delivering the same audiovisual works on VOD and catch-up TV (and  on  DVD),
audiovisual media services cannot apply a consistent reduced  VAT  rate.  It
is essential to allow Member States to apply a  reduced  VAT  rate  for  all
audiovisual works independently of their delivery method and  in  particular
in the online environment. Such  a  reduced  rate  would  boost  the  online
market twofold: by competing on price with physical products and by  drawing
consumers away from illegal services.

In the text and image sector, current legislation is of no hindrance to  the
development of multi-territorial solutions. Rights for foreign  authors  and
publishers are generally  administered  through  the  network  of  bilateral
agreements between CMOs. A user  may  obtain  a  licence  for  a  repertoire
managed by a CMO established in another Member State by means of  reciprocal
arrangements between CMOs, each of them acting on  behalf  of  the  other(s)
within its own territory. The  principle  of  copyright  territoriality  has
also been reconfirmed in the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union’s
(CJEU’s) “Premier League” case (C-403/08).


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

YES

The scope of the making available right is clear  enough  from  a  practical
point of  view.  However,  the  making  available  right  itself  should  be
clarified by introducing an unwaivable right of authors to remuneration  for
their  making  available  right,  even  when  exclusive  rights  have   been
transferred, so that authors are guaranteed a financial reward  proportional
to the real exploitation of their works. Otherwise this right is bought  out
by producers and no value is received by the authors.




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[23])?


NO


LITA does not think that a clarification of the  territorial  scope  of  the
making available right would have any  impact  on  the  recognition  of  the
authors’ rights, the possible transfer of  rights  and  their  remuneration.
These issues are mainly dealt with in legislation  and  authors’  contracts.
The only way to address the current problems related to these issues  is  to
tackle them directly through harmonisation and not through  the  territorial
scope of the making available right.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[24]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[25] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES –Please explain

The provision of a hyperlink can encompass many  indexing  methods  such  as
access, framing or embedding. A hyperlink is  not  however  a  mere  digital
reference which only gives information on a  content  like  a  footnote;  it
gives access to the content, it makes it available to the public.

In principle, the provision of  a  hyperlink  should  therefore  require  an
authorisation of the rightholder if it communicates a protected work to  the
public. This is particularly true for ‘embedded’ or  ‘framed’  links  within
websites, especially if there is commercial gain. In the  case  of  embedded
and  framed  links,  the  digital  service  operator  is  considered  as  an
organisation which “intervenes, in full knowledge  of  the  consequences  of
its actions, to give access to the protected work to its  customers”  (CJEU,
7 December 2006, C-306/05 Rafael Hoteles para. 42).  Providing  a  hyperlink
to a  protected  work  whose  communication  to  the  public  has  not  been
authorised is clearly a copyright infringement.

The CJEU provided some guidance on hyperlinks in the  Svensson  v  Retriever
Sverige AB case (C-466/12). The CJEU held that the  provision  of  clickable
links to protected works (press articles  by  several  Swedish  journalists)
published on a freely accessible basis on a website  (the  Göteborgs-Posten)
does not constitute a  communication  to  the  public  under  the  Copyright
Directive, so the  authorisation  of  the  rightholders  was  not  required.
Indeed, the CJEU explained that the communication  must  be  directed  to  a
‘new public’ and there is no  new  public  in  the  case  of  the  Retriever
Sverige site  according  to  the  CJEU,  since  the  works  offered  on  the
Göteborgs-Posten were freely  accessible.  Accordingly,  the  users  of  the
Retriever Sverige website were deemed to  be  part  of  the  public  already
taken into account by the journalists at the time  the  publication  on  the
Göteborgs-Posten was authorised.

Replying to the other questions asked by the Swedish court,  the  CJEU  also
noted that this is so even if the internet users who click on the link  have
the impression that the work is appearing on the Retriever Sverige  website,
whereas in fact it  comes  from  the  Göteborgs-Posten.  Finally,  the  CJEU
clarified that Member States do not have the right to give wider  protection
to copyright holders by broadening the  concept  of  ‘communication  to  the
public’  since  it  would   create   legislative   differences   and   legal
uncertainty. Even though the CJEU noted that had the works not  been  freely
accessible in the first place, the authorisation of the  rightholders  would
have  been  required,  the  CJEU  left  many  important  related   questions
unanswered. These include the question of the purpose of links,  if  not  to
increase the public which can access the works (i.e. why  not  ‘new  public’
in this case), the situation of ad-sponsored sites was  not  considered  and
the  potential  implications  for  links  to  freely  accessible  infringing
content neither. Indeed, the decision has  been  widely  criticised[26]  for
its limited scope and doubtful reasoning and is thought to be the  first  of
a string of European references on hyperlinking.


  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to  an  authorised  act
should not require additional consent from the copyright holder.  This  does
not mean that all “cache” memory copies are to be considered “temporary”  or
strictly “incidental” ones. The facts of the case need to  be  analysed  and
that is best left to the courts.  Technological   development  has  had  the
effect  that  copyright  content  is  increasingly  viewed  or  listened  to
(“streamed”)  through  computer  browsers  rather  than  by  the  making  of
downloaded copies. The  increasing  use  of  streaming  is  documented,  for
example,  in  a  report  prepared  for  Ofcom[27],  which  tracked   digital
behaviours and attitudes among persons aged 12+, in the United Kingdom.  The
report noted that the incidence of streaming of TV programmes was much  more
common  than  downloading  (33%  for   streaming,   compared   to   9%   for
downloading). Streaming services are one  variety  of  “on-demand”  service,
which is specifically referred to in Recital 10 to Directive  2001/29/EC  as
requiring protection. would not be compatible with common sense  of  justice
that essentially the same act – making a copy of the monitoring  report  for
the purpose of reading its content – should not require  a  licence  in  one
case (when accessed online), while it does in the other (when accessed by e-
mail).  If  viewing  and  streaming  were   not   subject   to   rightholder
authorisation,  this  anomaly  would  exist  in   the   online   environment
generally, where the problem of piracy is notorious.


Accessing the same content by the easy alternative of visiting  the  website
of an unlicensed website (claiming to avoid the payment of  a  licence  fee)
obviously  conflicts  with  the  normal  exploitation  of  the   works   and
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the  copyright  holders,
thereby infringing the three-step test  in  international  conventions  that
the EU Member States are party to, as  well  as  Article  5(5)  of  European
Union Copyright Directive (EUCD). The computer user deliberately  creates  a
copy of the work on his computer screen. It is his very purpose  in  opening
his browser and going to a webpage for a book or article,  and/or  streaming
a sound recording or film. The end user must therefore be obliged to  obtain
a licence to access the underlying work. This does not prevent a  user  from
reading,  viewing  or  listening  to  content  that  has  been  made  legaly
available on the web with the consent of the copyright holder.  Any  further
use is, however, subject to authorisation or licensing.





Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[28].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[29].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[30]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[31].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ NO


We do not support registration of works or other subject matters, because
we do not think that it would be for the benefit of the rights holders.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[32], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[33]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[34]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[35] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[36]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?
Yes - Please explain

The 1993 Directive harmonising the  term  of  protection  of  copyright  and
certain related rights recalled that the Berne  Convention  lays  down  only
minimum terms of  protection,  leaving  Contracting  States  free  to  grant
longer terms (recital 1).  As  certain  Member  States  had  exercised  this
entitlement,  the  resulting  differences   between   national   laws   were
considered as distorting competition in the internal market which  justified
harmonisation so as to make terms of  protection  identical  throughout  the
Community (recital 2).

The Directive recalls that the minimum term of protection laid down  by  the
Berne Convention (life of the author and  50  years  after  his  death)  was
intended to provide protection for the author and the first two  generations
of  his  descendants  and  considered  that  the  average  lifespan  in  the
Community had increased,  to  the  point  where  this  term  was  no  longer
sufficient to cover two generations (recital  5).  Therefore,  in  order  to
establish a high level of protection, which  at  the  same  time  meets  the
requirements of the internal market  and  the  need  to  establish  a  legal
environment  conducive  to  the  harmonious  development  of  literary   and
artistic creation in the Community (recital 11),  the  Directive  harmonised
the term of protection for copyright at 70 years  after  the  death  of  the
author.

Therefore, apart from harmonisation, the main reason for  the  extension  of
the term of protection from 50 to 70 years was the extension of the  average
lifespan in Europe. LITA does not see  any  reason  linked  to  the  digital
environment that would question this extension.


 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[37].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[38].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[39], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[40],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[41].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?
  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

LITA is not in favour of any additional  exceptions  to  the  long  list  of
exceptions in the 2001 Copyright Directive.

We do not see how more detailed norms on a Community level could  serve  the
purpose of improved access to copyright works  or  enhanced  competitiveness
in a changing technological and media environment.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

€ NO OPINION


We think that the system  of  exceptions  should  be  more  harmonised.  The
exceptions included in  the  Slovak  Copyright  Act  sometimes  broaden  the
intention of the European lawmaker.


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]
It seems reasonable that fair compensation be due in  the  place  where  the
end user benefits from the exception, as is the case, for example, with  the
private copying exception (levies are  due  in  the  country  in  which  the
‘harm’ to the rightholder arises, i.e. in the country in which the end  user
who bought the product resides according to the Opus ruling of the CJUE,  C-
462/09). In addition, it is crucial that remuneration  be  provided  to  the
rightholders in the country where they reside, which is possible  thanks  to
reciprocal agreements between collective management organisations.
In Slovakia the fair compensation is guaranteed  only  for  private  copying
and reprography.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[42] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[43].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[44].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

There is need on the part of  the  institutions  to  cover  such  uses,  the
current legal situation however does  not  allow  LITA  to  grant  licences,
which would justify the needs of the institutions.



  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Problem-solving depends on the type and character of  the  problem.  Without
specifying the problems the question becomes too  imprecise  to  provide  an
appropriate answer. However, in general, problems are  best  solved  through
licensing  arrangements,  whenever  appropriate,  and  through   stakeholder
dialogues.  Organisations   representing   libraries,   archives,   authors,
publishers and CMOs have a proven track record in developing  solutions  for
libraries and  archives  through  stakeholder  dialogues.  Examples[45]  are
principles for rights clearance and registries of orphan works  and  out-of-
commerce works.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the

There is need on the part of  the  institutions  to  cover  such  uses,  the
current legal situation however does  not  allow  LITA  to  grant  licences,
which would justify the needs of the institutions.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

[Open question]
Traditional uses can be covered  by  licences,  because  the  law  envisions
them. Neither European nor our local law has envisioned the  new  uses,  and
that is why we cannot cover such uses.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[46].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[47].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


Some EU Member States have already incorporated legislation to enable  large
scale  digitisation  and  making  available  of  cultural  heritage  through
licensing. Whether EU or national legislation is  required  depends  on  and
can only be answered when the EC has made known its  proposed  solution  for
cross-border accessibility.





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain

LITA  is  committed  to  pursuing  the  project  that  was  started  in  WG3
(Audiovisual and Film Heritage Institutions)  of  Licences  for  Europe  and
find a way to undertake mass digitisation and clearance for online  uses  of
the  high  volume  of  older  works  in  the  archives  of   film   heritage
institutions and public services  broadcasters.  Audiovisual  authors’  CMOs
have a central role to play  in  helping  these  institutions  preserve  and
offer to the public the cultural heritage of great works.

Thanks to the Statement of Principles  and  Procedures  for  heritage  films
online concluded between ACE, FERA, FIAPF and the SAA  during  Licences  for
Europe, film heritage institutions  and  rightholders’  representatives  now
have a clear roadmap to discuss and agree terms  for  digitising,  restoring
and making available European film heritage. It will  enable  film  heritage
institutions to free up  European  films  stored  in  their  archives  while
guaranteeing rightholders an appropriate share of the rewards.

As  far  as  broadcasters’  archives  are  concerned,  no  broad   agreement
including all stakeholders could be reached during the Licences  for  Europe
timeframe. EBU and the SAA (LITA is member of SAA) together  developed  some
recommendations  highlighting  that  collective  licensing   solutions   are
particularly suitable for the large scale clearance of rights.  There  is  a
clear need for proportionate and cost effective rights clearance  mechanisms
for such large archives. This would help make a very significant  amount  of
works available, particularly for research and educational purposes.

Further discussions are needed to develop  an  MoU  or  any  other  type  of
general  agreement  that  would  propose  a  suitable  solution   for   mass
digitization  and  rights  clearance  of  broadcasters’  archives  based  on
collective management.


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


The concept of  “illustration  for  teaching”  often  causes  uncertainties,
which can  also  result  in  litigation.  CMOs  began  their  activities  in
response to requests from educational institutions for the  facilitating  of
large scale reproduction of chapters and  other  fragments  of  the  world’s
scientific and cultural heritage for teaching and research purposes.


Lately,  there  are  educational  institutions  that   have   claimed   that
“illustration for teaching” includes multiple copying  and  other  forms  of
uses which have traditionally been authorised through agreements with  CMOs,
or  made  subject  to  remuneration,  including  under  remuneration  rights
schemes. On  this  basis,  they  refuse  to  take  up  a  licence  with  the
appropriate CMO.


LITA understands  the  exception  in  Article  5(3)(a)  as  being  a  narrow
exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it  reads:
to illustrate; which is far from being the  same  as  planned  producing  of
teaching  material.  The   underlying   rationale   for   the   concept   of
“illustration for teaching” is to cover minor acts of copying, for  instance
a teacher writing something down on the blackboard or  a  whiteboard,  or  a
student copying a passage of a text for  revision  or  exam  purposes.  This
understanding of the concept is in accordance with its wording  as  well  as
of the opinions expressed by the foremost experts on it.  Teaching  material
in whatever format, including multiple copying  for  classroom  use,  cannot
and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it would  definitely
undermine the normal exploitation of these works.


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Clarification  on both Community and national levels that “illustration for
teaching” does not comprise the reproduction, making available and
distribution of teaching material, such as in the form of arranged, planned
or structured multiple copies for classroom use, compilations, e-reserves
and the sort would be appropriate. Such access to works is offered by
authors and publishers directly, or through rights administration by CMOs.

  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]

Scientific  and  research  communities  already  make   extensive   use   of
individual  licensing  schemes  offered   by   publishers,   combined   with
collective schemes offered by  CMOs,  also  for  online  use  of  works  for
teaching or research purpose.

CMOs exist in virtually all Member States to offer legal uses  of  copyright
works that complements  licensing  by  authors  and  publishers.  Collective
schemes  administered  by  CMOs  include  scanning   of   books,   journals,
magazines, etc., copying from electronic  carriers  and  Internet  downloads
for a variety of uses, including for  the  printing  out  of  a  hard  copy,
posting to internal networks accessible to  authorised  users  specified  in
the licence, inclusion  in  course  packs,  and  other  relevant  uses.  The
arrangements encompass and clarify the use of works  for  “illustration  for
teaching”. Examples of tools  offered  by  CMOs  to  legally  use  copyright
protected text and image works, also for  education,  were  presented  as  a
part of the result of the EC initiative Licences for Europe, WG2.

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[49]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[50]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [51].

The Marrakesh Treaty[52] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[53] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[54].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[55]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[56].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

YES - Please explain

As a preliminary remark, it has to be noticed that there is no  universally-
acknowledged  definition  of   what   constitutes   user-generated   content
(UGC).The questionnaire refers to UGC as a  new  type  of  online  activity,
taking one or several pre-existing works, changing something  in  the  works
and uploading the result onto the internet e.g. to platforms and blogs.

Whether amateur or professional, creative works  are  subject  to  the  same
copyright rules. Meaning that the use of existing protected works  needs  to
be authorised by the rightholder, unless an exception can be invoked.

The Commission document for this consultation highlights that  social  media
platforms have vastly changed the scale of  such  activities  and  increased
the potential economic impact for rightholders in  the  pre-existing  works.
If this is the case, why is there so little case-law on this issue?

Authors do not  oppose  UGC  in  principle.  They  are  very  familiar  with
creative processes which  use  pre-existing  works,  in  particular  in  the
audiovisual  sector  where  films  very  often  use   recorded   music   and
documentaries are sometimes made of extracts of older works. The process  is
therefore not new, particularly for professional authors, and  authorisation
guarantees respect for moral rights.

What is striking with UGC is the claim of some users to create  UGC  content
without seeking the permission of the authors  of  the  pre-existing  works,
but to ask for recognition of  their  rights  on  the  new  works.  This  is
unacceptable, as is the way in which Q.59 below is phrased –  it  recognises
the rights of the creator of the new  work  but  fails  to  acknowledge  the
rights of the original rightholder,  i.e.  the  owner  of  the  pre-existing
work(s) on the basis of which the new work was created!

The essence of this activity of generating and  uploading  UGC  renders  any
court proceedings ineffective: rightholders  would  probably  win  the  case
from a legal perspective but the costs of the proceedings  largely  outweigh
the possible financial benefit.

It is a pity that WG2 of Licences for Europe was unable to deliver  on  this
issue, due to the opposition of users’ groups to any licensing solutions  as
they favour the introduction of a new exception to authors’ rights.

In our view, the  solution  to  user-generated  content  lies  in  licensing
schemes concluded between rightholders’ representatives  such  as  CMOs  and
the social media platforms  as  well  as  micro-licences  for  small  users,
unless an exception is applicable.  In  fact,  many  examples  of  licensing
schemes are already being developed (e.g. in the music sector  according  to
GESAC’s statement and IFPI’s announcement)  and  should  be  encouraged  and
promoted.

As previously said in our answer to Q.58, the use of pre-existing  protected
works to create  user-generated  content  needs  the  authorisation  of  the
authors or their representatives (in particular, to  guarantee  respect  for
moral rights), unless an exception can be invoked.

Anything falling outside  existing  exceptions  should  be  dealt  with  via
simple licensing solutions. These licensing mechanisms should be devised  to
ensure that very personal uses would cost  virtually  nothing  in  terms  of
licensing fees and the cost of licenses generally would be proportionate  to
the use made of the works. It is noteworthy that internet  platforms  should
not be the main beneficiaries of the success of UGC, so  licenses  with  the
platforms rather than only with the individuals themselves  should  also  be
sought.

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[57]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[58][59].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[60]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain

YES - Please explain

Regarding the private copying exemptions the following principles are
recognised and enforced at EU level (Mrs. Castex report):

    •  Private  copying  is  justly  accompanied  by  compensation  for  the
      rightholders.

    • Having levies on  devices  and  media  making  private  copies  is  an
      efficient and cost-effective way to organise the compensation.

    • An important element of the system’s cost-effectiveness is to  collect
      the levies at the earliest stages of the sales chain,  i.e.  from  the
      manufacturer or the importer.

    • The amount of private copying compensation should  be  linked  to  the
      value of the creative works being copied, not  to  the  price  of  the
      devices which can depend on commercial strategies.

    • The private copying system should be  brought  into  the  digital  age
      taking into account that consumers make private copies more than  ever
      before on ever more connected devices and services.

    • There is a need for common principles  for  defining  applicable  levy
      rates and devices/services that should be subject to levies.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[61]
YES - Please explain

In its contributions to the European Parliament  ‘Castex  report’,  the  SAA
explained that Mr. Vitorino’s recommendation (licensed copies do  not  cause
harm) suggests that all subsequent copies made of a work following  purchase
from digital services can be covered by licenses granted by rightholders  to
these services.  Mr Vitorino therefore  proposed  to  eliminate  levies  for
“new business models in the digital environment”.

This is based on a gross misconception of both the  private  copying  system
and the multitude of new digital services which provide access to  protected
works. Private copies cannot  be  licensed  since  they  are  covered  by  a
statutory exception to copyright  under  the  2001/29  Copyright  Directive.
Therefore licensing and fair compensation for private copying  can  only  be
separate issues.

Moreover, if the  private  copying  exception  was  questioned  and  private
copies inserted into licences, the ones that would suffer most from  such  a
change would be consumers and authors, the consumers  losing  their  freedom
to copy and the authors their fair compensation.

    • In practice, the authorisation, licence fee and commercial  terms  are
      negotiated by the  holders  of  exclusive  rights  with  each  digital
      service during the licensing process,  whereas  fair  compensation  is
      collected through the levy system and distributed to  rightholders  by
      CMOs.

    • Mr. Vitorino’s proposal derives from  the  flawed  idea  that  digital
      services would allow  rightholders  to  be  compensated  directly.  In
      practice, only few rightholders or categories  of  rightholders  grant
      licences   to   digital   services   (the   producers    or    further
      intermediaries). Other rightholders, such as audiovisual  authors  who
      transferred their exclusive rights to the  producer  sometimes  for  a
      lump-sum payment,  do  not  have  any  direct  relation  with  digital
      services and therefore, no possibility to be paid directly.

    • In this field, a huge advantage of the private copying system is  that
      it corrects inequalities between rightholders and guarantees that each
      category of rightholders benefits from a fair share of the value.





  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]

The application of levies to certain online services is justified  and  does
not think that it would  hinder  the  development  and  functioning  of  new
business models. One of the reasons being that,  just  like  the  prices  of
products across Europe do not vary in proportion  to  the  levy  rates,  the
prices of  online  services/new  business  models  are  most  probably  also
unaffected by the levy rates.

More copying for private and reprography  use  takes  place  now  than  ever
before. The devices and  media  which  enable  or  host  private  copies  of
protected works have increased, with storage  capacities  which  have  grown
exponentially.

Consumers transfer songs, videos texts and pictures from computers  to  hard
drives to phones to tablets to online lockers and back  again  in  order  to
save and access their personal libraries whenever and  wherever  they  want.
All of these processes are undeniably acts of private copying.

In addition, in line with the  principle  of  technical  neutrality,  copies
made via cloud services (and other future digital services which do not  yet
exist) many have the same purpose  (private  use)  as  the  copies  made  by
private individuals on their phones, tablets, etc. so should be included  in
the private copying system.

Applying private copying to certain cloud-based services means  that  copies
made on those specific cloud-based services would be taken into  account  by
usage studies which assess the harm caused.

  67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
      for products subject to levies?[62]

€ YES – Please explain

LTA has favoured the making of levies visible on the  invoices.  It  appears
to make sense, inter alia for reasons of transparency, to  show  the  device
and storage medium remuneration on the invoices, and  is  already  generally
the case for the administration of text and image levies.
In addition, consumers should be informed of the amount and  destination  of
the  levies  and  more  generally  the  reason  for  this  mechanism   which
compensates the freedom to copy they have  thanks  to  the  private  copying
exception. This would help  consumers  understand  how  important  the  levy
system is for the EU’s culture and rightholders and that they  are  part  of
and benefit from this virtuous system.


  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?
NO - Please explain
If the system of private copying levies is harmonised,  there  would  be  no
issue of undue levy payments. The rule would be that the levy is due in  the
Member State in which the final  user  who  purchased  the  product  resides
since that is where the ‘harm’ to the rightholder  would  arise  (CJEU  Opus
ruling). In any case, even if undue levy payments  occasionally  did  occur,
exemptions and reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that  such
equipment does not bear levies.

We note with surprise that the obligated  parties  i.e.  the  importers  and
producers of levied equipment have often problems with  providing  the  CMOs
with information, which should safeguard that no double payments appear.


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]


Devices and blank media can  serve  other  purposes  than  for  the  private
copying  of  protected  works.  This  should  be  taken  into  account  when
determining tariffs applicable to devices used to make private copies.

Exempting any business from private copying levies would be excessive  since
equipment  bought  by  companies  can  also  generate  private  copies.  The
determining factor is the  nature  of  the  use,  not  the  quality  of  the
purchaser.

When it comes to analysing the impact  of  reprography  levies,  it  is  not
relevant to make a distinction between private and professional uses,  since
both of them are subject to the payment of a levy. Against this  background,
it is also unnecessary to  distinguish  between  sales  of  devices  in  the
private and business sectors. The point is that copies are permitted by  law
in both the private and  business  spheres.  The  –  unified  –  device  and
storage medium remuneration can therefore be justified  both  for  sales  to
private persons and sales to business end users.





  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]

Firstly, the rightholders’ proposal to introduce a single declaration  point
would    facilitate    declaration     and     payment     procedures     by
manufacturers/importers. Indeed, the proposal to create  a  single  European
declaration was put forward by European rightholders  during  the  2008-2009
dialogue, and agreed with the  ICT  industry.  It  aims  to  facilitate  the
implementation of  the  “Opus”  ruling  of  the  CJEU  (C-462/09).  Via  the
“European  Central  Point”  mechanism,   distance   sellers   could   submit
declarations of sales of goods eligible  to  private  copying  levies  at  a
single EU entry point, while the compensation would be invoiced and paid  in
the country of destination.

Secondly, the most efficient and cost-effective way to collect levies is  to
do so at the earliest stage of the sales  chain,  i.e.  the  manufacture  or
import stage. Shifting the  liability  to  pay  levies  onto  retailers,  as
proposed by Mr.Vitorino, would  render  the  system  extremely  complex  and
costly  since  this  would  considerably  increase  the  number   of   those
responsible for paying the levies and the means  needed  to  ensure  billing
and control systems.

The prime responsibility of manufacturers and importers for payment  of  the
levies must go hand in hand with joint liability of all entities  throughout
the chain of sales down to the final consumer in order  to  avoid  potential
fraud and  unfair  competition.  This  principle  was  also  agreed  between
representatives of rightholders and the ICT industry  during  the  2008-2009
dialogue.

Thirdly, the fact that  leviable  devices  and  blank  media  differ  across
Member States means that the same product can be subject to private  copying
levies in a Member State and not in another. Compensation systems should  be
in place for all devices and media whose value is  increased  by  multimedia
storage  and  playback  features.  Therefore,  a  consistent  definition  of
devices and media subject  to  private  copying  levies  in  the  respective
Member States should be sought.  The  rightholders’  organisations  proposed
during the 2008-2009 dialogue that all products (devices and media) able  to
be used to make private copies of protected works  should  be  eligible  for
the  private  copying  compensation  scheme,  with  a   list   of   products
established and regularly updated at EU level.

However, the interruption of the dialogue by the ICT industry  in  2010  did
not end in any  concrete  result  and  the  Vitorino  report  was  a  missed
opportunity as, despite  suggesting  a  degree  of  harmonisation  (such  as
regarding the definition of harm), Mr.  Vitorino  recommended  Member  State
flexibility in the choice of devices subject to levies.

Fourthly,  European  rightholders  organisations  agree  that  a  quick  and
harmonised levy setting procedure should be developed  across  Europe.  This
would mean putting in place a European framework of definitions,  principles
and procedures to be respected by all Member States in the establishment  of
their levy setting process.

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[63] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[64]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]
Fair remuneration of authors in the audiovisual sector is a big concern  and
a very important issue for LITA.  For  audiovisual  authors,  such  a  ‘best
mechanism’ to ensure that they all receive  adequate  remuneration  for  the
exploitation of their works does not  yet  exist.  In  our  view,  ‘adequate
remuneration’ should relate to the  use  made  of  the  authors’  works  and
should in particular reward the  success  of  works.  This  is  why  buy-out
contracts,  which  prevent  this  from  happening,  would  never  amount  to
mechanisms guaranteeing adequate remuneration.

Contractual practices in the vast majority  of  European  countries  deprive
audiovisual authors of the exercise of their rights and  prevent  them  from
receiving  fair  remuneration  for  the   exploitation   of   their   works.
Audiovisual authors in many countries are  forced,  because  of  their  weak
bargaining position and the absence  of  legislation  to  protect  them,  to
assign all their rights and receive a one-off fee at  the  production  stage
with no further payments linked to the  exploitation  of  the  work,  except
when collective agreements are in place (in very few countries  and  limited
to the exploitation taking  place  in  the  country)  and  for  collectively
managed rights such as cable retransmission and private  copying  which  are
developed almost all over Europe.

These further payments linked to the exploitation of  the  work  (which  can
continue for years) are however essential for authors to make a  living  in-
between projects. The characteristic of this profession is that it can  take
years to prepare a film and enter into production.

LITA therefore proposes to  by-pass  unfair  contractual  practices  and  to
develop a sustainable remuneration system  which  would  secure  audiovisual
authors’ remuneration for  their  making  available  right  in  the  digital
market, taking advantage of the new technologies.

Such a  proposal  for  European  legislation  builds  on  the  harmonisation
experience in the EU:

    - the 1992 Rental Right  Directive  which  provides  for  an  unwaivable
      remuneration right for the rental.

    - the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive which  provides  for  mandatory
      collective administration of the cable retransmission right

When an audiovisual author has transferred his making available right  to  a
producer, he retains the right to  obtain  equitable  remuneration  for  the
making available which cannot be waived, as  is  the  case  for  the  rental
right. It also addresses the implementation aspects in order to ensure  that
the proposal will result in concrete payments to authors.

Two implementation aspects are in  practice  extremely  important  and  were
lacking in  the  1992  Rental  Right  Directive:  who  should  pay  for  the
equitable remuneration and how should it be administered.

1/ The equitable remuneration should be paid by audiovisual  media  services
that make audiovisual works available to the public  on-demand  and  exploit
them;

2/  Its  administration  should  be  entrusted  to   collective   management
organisations representing audiovisual  authors,  unless  other  audiovisual
authors’ organisations, such as unions or guilds, are in a  better  position
to guarantee such remuneration in a specific country.

This proposal aims at offering an equal opportunity to  audiovisual  authors
who are not in a position to be able to refuse the transfer of a right to  a
producer and thus achieving a level playing field in terms  of  remuneration
for all audiovisual authors in Europe.

This European legislation  is  a  necessity  as  contractual  practices  are
unable to guarantee such remuneration to audiovisual authors for the  making
available of  their  works.  European  producers,  which  are  mainly  small
companies, are  very  much  focused  on  the  production  stage  and  little
involved in the subsequent exploitation. They have therefore  not  developed
industrial processes and mechanisms to trace and administer payments due  to
authors for the distribution of their works on multiple platforms  and  most
of them would prefer not to do it at all since it would be costly. The  only
entities to do this are authors’ collective management  organisations.  They
are today ready to invest further in order to address the  remuneration  due
to audiovisual authors for the online distribution of their works.





  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?


YES - Please explain

LITA supports an intervention by the Commission into contractual  practices.
Indeed,  we  support  fairer  contractual  terms   and   practices,   whilst
acknowledging that this will not solve all the problems, in  particular  the
remuneration issue of audiovisual authors  for  the  exploitation  of  their
works.  Any  initiative  in  this  field  should  therefore  complement  the
introduction into EU legislation of an unwaivable right to  remuneration  of
audiovisual authors for their making available right, based on the  revenues
generated from the online distribution  of  their  works  and  collected  by
collective management organisations from final distributors.


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]
In  most  European  countries,  audiovisual  authors  suffer   from   unfair
contractual terms (excessive transfer  of  rights  in  terms  of  scope  and
duration, transfer of rights to remuneration, etc.) imposed by producers  or
broadcasters  in  the  individual  negotiation  of  their  contract.   These
negotiations too often result in  buy-out  contracts,  authors  receiving  a
lump sum payment for the writing and/or  directing  of  the  film,  with  no
further payment no matter how commercially successful the film  goes  on  to
be. Even when authors sign contracts which respect their economic  interests
and provide for additional remuneration, they  rarely  receive  any  payment
automatically, except when collective rules are in  place  and  enforced  in
particular by collective rights management organisations.

In parallel  to  European  initiatives  to  ensure  proper  remuneration  of
authors, consideration should be given to developing key standards for  fair
and enforceable contractual terms in  individual  contracts,  including  the
prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.

Here are a  number  of  concrete  examples  of  unfair  contract  terms  and
practices:

    • Especially in film contracts, deferral  of  fees.   Fees  are  usually
      deferred to a point where a film  earns  back  sufficient  revenue  or
      profits. It is quite common that films fail to  earn  back  enough  to
      trigger the  reimbursement  of  the  deferral  so  these  clauses  are
      effectively agreements to waive pay. 

    •  Where contracts do contain an entitlement to bonuses or  rewards  for
      success, these are most often expressed as percentages of net  profits
      or of  producer  profits.  In  practice,  because  of  the  fact  that
      producers themselves can be in a  poor  position,  dubious  accounting
      practices and breaks in the distribution chain (see below) it is  very
      rare that any returns from such clauses ever materialise.

    • It is common for film rights (and sometimes TV rights)  to  be  traded
      and re-traded from one intermediary/aggregator/distributor to another,
      either on a territory or media basis. Contracts  may  still  hold  the
      original producer liable to pay further rewards  to  a  director,  but
      this  can  be  frustrated  if  there  is  a  break  in  the  chain  of
      intermediaries for whatever reason (e.g. bankruptcy, failure to report
      a transfer of rights) and if the original  production  company  itself
      goes into liquidation – this is common when a special purpose  vehicle
      company is set up to make  a  film  and  then  dissolved  once  it  is
      completed.

In addition, one way of ensuring  the  enforceability  of  fair  contractual
terms would be that producers applying for public funds for  the  production
of films and audiovisual works should  be  obliged  to  provide  a  copy  of
authors’ contracts among the  documentation.  The  body  providing  for  the
financial support would have the obligation to check it.  This  would  be  a
strong incentive for producers to  better  respect  authors’  rights  as  it
would become a pre-condition for obtaining public financial support.


  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[65] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[66].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[67]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[68].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain



  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?



  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

Single European copyright should be a long term  project,  which  should  be
preceded by stronger harmonisation. We think that, at the time being, it  is
possible to tackle the challenges of the digital market by amending  of  the
existing EU legislative acts.

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]
More generally, it is crucial that creators be placed at the  centre  of  EU
copyright policy. After years of distrust and attacks against  copyright  by
users’ and consumers’ groups who want to undermine a  system  that  they  do
not consider fit for the digital age, there is an  essential  need  to  give
back legitimacy to a system that promotes creativity, freedom of  expression
and dissemination of culture.

The best way to provide legitimacy to the copyright system is  to  reconnect
it  to  creators  and  ensure  that  creators  are  the   first   and   main
beneficiaries of the licence fees and remuneration paid by users.

The current European copyright law does not provide for  such  a  guarantee,
except in limited cases (unwaivable right to equitable remuneration for  the
rental right) and gives rise  to  criticisms  that  it  only  works  to  the
benefit of major entertainment companies.

There is therefore a need to rebalance European copyright policy  in  favour
of authors and other creators as original rightholders.  This  needs  to  be
the focus and priority of any forthcoming copyright reform.

This is a win-win solution for users and for all rightholders  as  it  would
clarify that creators are the main beneficiaries  of  the  copyright  system
and therefore strengthen its legitimacy and its enforcement,  in  particular
online.

The digital age has presented CMOs with a set of major  challenges  to  many
aspects of their operations. The analogue world has  been  replaced  by  one
characterised by mass  uses  and  transactions  of  copyright  works,  lower
values of licences for transactions and  much  greater  flexibility  in  the
type of uses being made and the devices on which uses take place. CMOs  have
adapted to this – and continue to do so – by doing the following:

    • Investing in new  technology,  software  and  systems  to  keep  their
      licensing operations fit for purpose

    • Improving their governance, transparency and accountability to members
      and users

    • Simplifying their licensing procedures to reduce transaction costs

    • Innovating in the kind of licences being offered

    • Making it a central objective to see the works of members receive  the
      greatest possible legitimate distribution

    • Promoting the use  of  copyright  works  for  education  and  cultural
      purposes

    • Making it a priority to engage young people directly whether they  are
      users or creators of copyright works – and sometimes both at the  same
      time – so that they learn respect for the value of creativity and  are
      encouraged to express themselves creatively

We feel that the tone of the debate over copyright has so far been  far  too
confrontational.  Our  desire  is  to  see  a  much  healthier  relationship
develop between creators and the audiences for their works. Accordingly,  we
approved of the collaborative approach adopted by the Commission during  the
Licences for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue and  we  were  disappointed  that
many groups failed to step forward in that spirit. We  would  urge  them  to
come back to this notion of collaboration.

[10] Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council
of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[31] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[32] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[33] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[34] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

[43] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own

two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
