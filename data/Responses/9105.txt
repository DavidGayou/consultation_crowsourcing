Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2] [3] with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether
to table legislative reform proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

I. Introduction


Q 0:  What are the main concerns for Spanish cinema exhibitors?

The Spanish Cinema Exhibitors Association (FECE) represents  more  than  85%
of cinema exhibitors in Spain.  We  represent  3.  000  screens,  an  annual
turnover of around € 600 million euro and more than  90  million  admissions
per year. Cinema  theatres  are  a  vital  component  of  the  cultural  and
creative fabric  of  each  member  states  and  make  significant  economic,
cultural and social contributions.

In  each  EU  Member  State  cinema  exhibition  remains  by  far  the  most
significant  market  for  film[9].  We  regret  that  the  value   and   the
interdependency of different film markets,  the  risk-profile  of  the  film
industry, its financing and release practices as well as  its  fragmentation
along linguistic and cultural lines seem  to  not  have  informed  questions
asked in the consultation document. That being said,  cinema  exhibition  of
course strongly supports the emergence of a  legitimate  online  market  for
films. The entire  industry  –  including  cinema  exhibition  –  indirectly
benefits from revenues in  the  home  entertainment  segment  as  they  help
contribute  to  the  creation  of  compelling,  competitive  and  culturally
diverse films. We are however  convinced  that  showing  European  films  in
cinemas for a sustainable and exclusive period of time is by  far  the  best
way to create excitement around and interest in  any  film,  including  non-
national European film.

Cinema exhibitors strongly believe that copyright is the  best  enabler  for
the creation, distribution and exhibition of films and alternative  content.
A robust European copyright framework is vital if Europe is to maintain  and
grow a competitive and culturally diverse film sector.

Copyright is a  fundamental  right  that  promotes  cultural  diversity  and
safeguards the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Europeans  that  work
in our industry. In this context, cinema exhibitors  strongly  believe  that
our sector as well as all other film markets will only  continue  to  thrive
to the benefit of consumers if key copyright principles that  are  enshrined
in the seven European  copyright  directives  and  agreed  in  international
treaties are respected. These include:

    • Contractual freedom – the right of rightholders to freely decide the
      terms and conditions under which they wish to exploit their works;
    • Exclusivity – the right to grant exclusive exploitation rights (a
      right linked to contractual freedom);
    • Territoriality – the right for rightholders to decide on the
      geographic scope of a licence (a right linked to contractual freedom);
    • Enforcement – the right to prevent unauthorised exploitation of
      copyright protected works.

Cinema exhibitors share the concerns of most creative  content  stakeholders
in relation to the present consultation process. We regret  the  short  time
given to answer 80 fundamental and  far  reaching  questions.  We  are  also
concerned that many of those  questions  seem  to  imply  a  disposition  on
behalf of  the  European  Commission  to  weaken  exclusive  rights  and  to
pressure the film sector to establish pan-European services, this despite  a
lack  of  evidence  that  there  is  sufficient  consumer  demand  for  such
services.

We take the view that the European Copyright  Acquis  is  working  and  that
there is not sufficient  evidence  that  reform  is  required.  The  current
framework in Europe is flexible and  constantly  evolving.  It  strikes  the
right balance between the promotion of property rights, cultural  diversity,
access to culture and internal market objectives.

The need  to  review  EU  Copyright  rules  must  hence  be  evidenced.  Any
premature  decisions  on  reform  would  disproportionately  benefit   major
Internet  players  who  do  not  have  a  stake  in  producing,   financing,
distributing and showing films or creative content in Europe.

A robust and at the same time flexible European Copyright framework  –  such
as the present one – is the best way to ensure that the  film  industry  can
continue to offer compelling, competitive and culturally diverse  films  and
services to its consumers.



Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[10].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[11] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[12];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[13]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[14].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[15].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[16]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
   when trying to access online services in an EU Member  State  other  than
   the one in which you live?


NO.  Cinema  exhibitors  take  the  view  that  their   partners   in   film
distribution as well  as  various  digital  platform  operators  would  make
available films  across  borders  if  sufficient  consumer  demand  existed.
Research shows that there is not sufficient demand  for  these  stakeholders
to establish commercially viable pan-European  VOD  services  for  film[17].
Indeed,  several  pan-European  initiatives  supported   by   the   European
Commission have for several years failed to create enough demand  for  their
services to exist without public support. This is because  consumers  favour
national services or services from countries that localise their  offers  in
terms of language and/or cultural appeal. This lack of  cross-border  demand
is  also  the  case  –  and  well-documented  –  in  cable   and   satellite
television[18].


On the other hand, it is important to recognise that there are  hundreds  of
national VOD platforms that make available national,  European  as  well  as
international titles to their audiences. The electronic sell-through  market
furthermore enables these consumers to take a  downloaded  film  to  another
country on their personal device  as  well  as  to  access  national  online
stores from anywhere and at any time.


We therefore have certain reservations regarding the first question of  this
consultation, as we feel that it betrays a certain bias.  In  our  view  the
main obstacle to establishing pan-European Video on Demand services  is  not
the nature of copyright.  It  is  the  diverging  tastes  and  interests  of
consumers, which vary along linguistic and cultural lines.





2.  [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you  faced  problems
   when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


NO. It is our understanding  that  nothing  in  EU  copyright  law  prevents
audiovisual rightholders and commercial users from agreeing on  territorial,
multi-territory or even global  licences.  Pan-European  licensing  does  in
fact take  place  in  some  rare  cases  and  sectors,  including  football.
However, commercial users then often choose to make  available  works  on  a
territorial basis, as local services and localised content are preferred  by
consumers.  The  main  problem  that  potential  providers  of  cross-border
services face is therefore a lack of consumer demand for such services.





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
   organisation:]  How  often  are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
   licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests  per  year
   and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
   of content concerned.


NO. Cinema exhibitors believe that the demand for  multi-territory  licences
is very limited. This is especially so if one does  not  take  into  account
linguistically similar countries, such as, for example, Austria and  Germany
or the Flemish-speaking region of Belgium and the Netherlands.


Film industry release practices take  account  of  territorial  requirements
and circumstances. Licensing therefore tends to take place  primarily  on  a
territorial  basis  due  to  consumer  demand,   cultural   and   linguistic
preferences,  cultural  policies  and  regulations  as  well  as  structural
differences. As demonstrated during the Licences for Europe  process,  these
realities include the need for tailored  marketing  campaigns,  dubbing  and
subtitling, adaptations to local release schedules,  the  identification  of
appropriate  promotional  partners,  and  many  other  aspects.  As  far  as
European cinematographic works are concerned, one has to keep in  mind  that
films  are  often  financed  by  local  stakeholders,  including  producers,
distributors, broadcasters  and  public  authorities.  Films  are  therefore
often created for a specific linguistic and  cultural  market  and  may  not
even be intended or fit for international distribution.


The current legal framework of course  enables  rightholders  to  distribute
all cinematographic works on a multi-territorial basis, should they wish  to
do  so.  However,  it  also  enables  them  to  respect   important   market
requirements  such  as  local  demand  as  well  as  to  grant   territorial
exclusivity to those that co-finance creation. The ability to do so  in  the
end makes the sector more competitive as well as more culturally diverse.





4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
   above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


Cinema exhibitors are not aware of any challenges that cannot  currently  be
solved by the marketplace. We believe that it is in the genuine interest  of
rightholders and commercial users to adapt to the  new  digital  environment
in which we all operate and to actively create demand in  new  markets  that
exist thanks to digital technology.





5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
   organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where  you  hold  all
   the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still
   find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on  a
   service provider (in order,  for  instance,  to  ensure  that  access  to
   certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?


YES. In our view there  are  objective  reasons  for  territorial  licensing
including, for example, the willingness to cater for local consumer  demand.
Film consumers tend to favour national as well  as  non-EU  content  due  to
cultural and linguistic preferences. Therefore, it is often not  financially
feasible to release a film in a foreign territory if  there  is  a  lack  of
demand.


When there is a case for international exploitation, the ability to  release
a film strategically in each territory in order to  maximise  the  value  of
each release is crucial. This may include giving a film more time to  create
revenues in certain version markets (theatrical, DVD, VOD sell-through,  VOD
streaming, etc.) depending on the circumstances in each  territory.  It  may
also include to not release a film in a specific territory until  a  certain
level of market demand has developed.


Furthermore, in cinema, production  models  are  often  built  around  joint
ventures (co-productions or co-financing),  which  rely  for  a  substantial
proportion of the financing on territorial splits of the rights amongst  the
partners. In exchange for assuming part of the risk of production,  a  local
financing partner often acquires exclusive rights to license  or  distribute
a film in a particular territory and/ or language.  These  splits  would  be
substantially devalued would their exclusivity  be  taken  away:  the  local
distributor, often  a  co-financier,  would  have  to  face  another  factor
threatening  the  recoupment  of  his/her  investment  if  the  content  was
accessed by the national consumer through any  means  in  another  territory
before the national release. Without the  practice  of  co-productions/  co-
financings, production levels for European works  would  drop  dramatically,
unless the EU or Member States stepped in with additional  direct  financing
support. Thus, a non-differentiated and  quasi-imposed  “single  audiovisual
market” would come at the high price of a loss of cultural diversity,  which
is enshrined as a key policy objective in the EU Treaty.





6.  [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster  or  a  service  provider:]
   Are there reasons why, even in cases where  you  have  acquired  all  the
   necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would  still
   find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  the
   service recipient (in order for instance, to  redirect  the  consumer  to
   a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


YES.  Just  as  in  cinema  exhibition,  our  understanding  is   that   the
establishment of new digital platforms in the  audiovisual  sector  requires
most notably  tailored  marketing  campaigns,  based  on  cultural/language,
regulatory  and  structural  realities,  not  to  mention  demand.   Release
schedules may also vary from country to country depending  on  a  number  of
factors such as  local  calendars,  dubbing  into  all  relevant  languages,
adapted film assets, local advertisement, the identification of  appropriate
promotional partners and publicity efforts, local  media  regulations,  etc.
Multi-territorial licenses are thus generally only  sought  for  markets  of
common languages or where a  particular  operator  or  distributor  has  the
necessary  scale  or  distributes  the  content   further   to   the   local
distributor.   Furthermore,  for  certain  types  of  audiovisual   content,
production models are built around joint  ventures  (co-productions  or  co-
financing) which rely for a  substantial  proportion  of  the  financing  on
territorial splits of the rights  amongst  the  partners.  In  exchange  for
assuming part of the risk of production, a  local  financing  partner  often
acquires exclusive rights to license or distribute a film  in  a  particular
territory and/ or language. These splits  would  be  substantially  devalued
would their exclusivity be taken away: the local distributor,  often  a  co-
financer, would have to face another factor threatening  the  recoupment  of
his/her investment if the content was  accessed  by  the  national  consumer
through any means in another territory before the national release.





7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
   including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level  to  increase  the
   cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
   ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


NO. No further measures are required in relation  to  EU  copyright  law  in
this context. Cinema exhibitors  take  the  view  that  nothing  prevents  a
rightholder to make available content or services on  a  pan-European  basis
or indeed to issue multi-territory licenses, should they wish to do  so  and
in certain areas such as football multi-territory licensing does occur.  The
real obstacle to a single market for creative content is not the  nature  of
copyright territoriality but a lack of cross-border demand due to  divergent
tastes, languages and infrastructure across the EU.





Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[19]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[20]
and databases[21].

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[22] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[23],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[24].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

   1. The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[25]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.



   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

YES. Cinema  exhibitors  take  the  view  that  the  scope  of  the  “making
available” right in cross-border situations is  sufficiently  clear  and  in
line with what has recently been confirmed by CJEU  jurisprudence[26].  This
jurisprudence confirms that this right is intended  to  be  broad,  durable,
flexible and  adaptable  to  technological  development.  This  is  a  right
intended to accommodate technological change  and  accordingly  must  retain
some degree of flexibility.

A recent EC study[27] also states that the  right  “remains  territorial”  –
territoriality is indeed the cornerstone of European creation  and  cultural
diversity.  Our  partners   across   the   European   audiovisual   industry
successfully rely on the making available right on a daily basis to  license
their content and enforce their rights online. Cross-border  situations  are
dealt with in contractual provisions and whenever required  they  have  been
clarified by national courts or the CJEU. As a matter of fact,  cross-border
access to content is already a reality whenever there is  sufficient  market
demand. Altering the right’s inherent  nature  would  risk  undermining  its
proven utility as a licensing and enforcement tool. The EC study[28],  after
examining alternative approaches such as the country  of  origin  principle,
therefore  concludes  by  warning  that   such   alternatives   would   face
significant caveats, creating only new  bottlenecks  and  significant  legal
uncertainty.


 9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the
    territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the
    recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to  be  an
    author or not, whether you are  considered  to  have  transferred  your
    rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement  of  rights
    (including the availability of injunctive relief)?


YES. As stated above, cinema exhibitors believe that  a  “clarification”  of
the territorial scope of the making available  right  is  neither  necessary
nor justified. Such “clarification” could narrow the  scope  of  the  making
available  right  and  give  rise  to  an   unjustified   expropriation   of
intellectual  property  contrary  to  Article  7  of  the  EU   Charter   of
Fundamental Rights. The “country of  origin”  approach,  for  example  –  as
suggested in the consultation document – risks  undermining  the  rights  of
rightholders in the country of reception  and  could  affect  in  particular
European  independent  film  which  relies  heavily  on  the   pre-sale   of
exploitation rights and especially co-productions. Such  an  approach  could
also seriously hamper the ability of rightholders to take  legal  action  to
address structurally infringing websites. The latter,  often  based  outside
the  EU  and  usually  operating  anonymously,  would   be   the   principal
beneficiaries of such an  approach.  Regarding  the  territoriality  of  the
making available  right  which  is  recognised  by  CJEU  jurisprudence  any
comparisons to communication  to  the  public  by  satellite  appear  to  be
inappropriate given the nature of technologies concerned.


   2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

NO. Many rights are attached to audiovisual goods and services protected  by
copyright (CDs, DVDs,  films,  broadcasting).  This  has  never  caused  any
problems with the transfer or the bundling of these rights,  which  is  most
of the time negotiated  individually  by  producers  and/  or  distributors.
Digital transmissions in the context of on-demand services  imply  both  the
making available right and the reproduction  right.  To  our  knowledge,  no
evidence  has  been  submitted  that  this  regime   is   not   sustainable.
Legislative  intervention,  which  would  limit  the  scope  of  the  making
available and/or reproduction rights  and  thereby  hinder  the  ability  of
rightholders to license their works would go against  the  EU’s  obligations
under international copyright norms.

3. Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[29]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[30] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES. A work or other subject matter  protected  by  copyright  can  only  be
published  with  the  authorisation  of  the  rightholder.   Only   if   the
rightholder has agreed to the publication and availability of the  work  on-
line and has not reserved his/her  rights,  the  provision  of  a  hyperlink
leading to the work requires no separate authorisation by  the  rightholder.
In all other cases, an authorisation of the rightholder should  be  required
for the provision of the hyperlink.
The importance that hyperlinking  plays  with  regard  to  content  delivery
online means that a broad exclusion from copyright would not only  undermine
basic licensing practices but it would also seriously hinder the ability  of
rightholders  to  fight  copyright  infringement.  Providers  of  links   to
unlicensed content, for example,  often  make  substantial  financial  gains
through ad revenues, thereby free-riding on the work  of  creators  who  are
not fairly rewarded for their efforts.
CJEU case law provides a workable and detailed “manual” for answering  fact-
specific questions related to when and under what circumstances  linking  or
indeed other technical operations online amount to a  communication  to  the
public. As a result, we take the position that  further  legislative  action
is not needed in  this  area.  It  is  vital  that  the  Courts  retain  the
possibility to  respond  to  specific  fact  patterns.  In  this  area,  any
legislation that attempted to establish a  specific  or  rigid  rule  as  to
whether a particular technical operation online would necessarily amount  to
a communication to the public or  not,  risks  being  outdated  quickly  and
could  remove  the  ability  for  the  courts  to  consider   the   specific
circumstances  of  a  given  case.  The  complexities  of  online  copyright
infringement are  such  that  this  could  have  the  unintended  effect  of
hindering enforcement – or indeed forms of licensing which operate by  means
of linking (licenses would no longer be relevant). Moreover, we expect  that
the pending referrals will provide further clarity  in  the  early  part  of
2014.

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES. A work or other subject matter  protected  by  copyright  can  only  be
published  with  the  authorisation  of  the  rightholder.   Only   if   the
rightholder has agreed to the publication and availability of the work on  a
web-page and has not reserved his/her rights, its temporary reproduction  on
the computer (on the screen and on the cache memory)  requires  no  separate
authorisation by the rightholder. In all other cases,  an  authorisation  of
the rightholder is required for such acts of reproduction.

The exclusive right of reproduction in Article 2 of the Copyright  Directive
extends  to  temporary  reproductions.  Beyond  the  actual  text  of   that
provision, the Court of Justice has already confirmed this point (see  e.g.,
FAPL). Subject to the provisions of  the  Article  5(1)  itself  and  CJEU’s
jurisprudence, national courts should retain  the  possibility  to  consider
specific  circumstances  to  determine  for  example  whether  or  not   the
exception for certain temporary copies in Article 5(1) is applicable.  There
may be cases where the copies on the screen  or  in  the  cache  memory  are
fully covered by Article 5(1). However, in the event those copies  are  from
illegal sources or whose purpose is to enable an unlawful use  (see  Article
5(1)(b))  the  exception  may  not  apply.  This  can  be  crucial  to   the
application of Article 8(3) where it may be necessary to show that  a  third
party is using an intermediary’s service to infringe copyright in  order  to
secure injunctive relief. The Court of  Justice  has  already  shown  it  is
fully capable of providing guidance as to when Article 5(1) applies  and  we
would expect it will continue to do so.  It is  also  worth  recalling  that
Article 5(1) is a mandatory  exception.  It  therefore  represents  a  fully
harmonised provision already somewhat bolstered by CJEU jurisprudence.

4. Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[31].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[32].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).


13. [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files  that  you  have  purchased
(e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

NO. No undue restrictions are known. If such acts of resale  are  restricted
this depends on the agreement between the user and the service provider  and
both parties have to respect the agreement.
Cinema  exhibitors  generally  believe  that  prohibiting  the  “resale”  of
digital files is not only often reasonable but also necessary  in  order  to
sustain new on-demand business models. One should keep in mind that  digital
files do not deteriorate over time  and  that  the  normal  distribution  of
content online would be undermined by unfair competition from a “resale”  of
copied works. Such forms of value creation do not  represent  an  “excessive
disadvantage to the user”. Terms and conditions in the  on-demand  space  in
fact often benefit the consumer by offering flexible models of  access  that
accommodate individual needs at varying price levels:  short term or  longer
term  rentals,  view  only  options,  view   and   download   options,   for
availability from  cloud  storage,  etc.  Rightholders  have  to  have  full
control over their rights  in  order  to  establish  flexible  and  scalable
online offers that do not simply replicate analogue licensing practices  but
add value for consumers.


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


In legal terms, allowing the resale of previously purchased digital  content
by law irrespective of the conditions of the sale agreement would amount  to
a statutory compulsory licence. It would be a severe interference  with  the
contract and de facto provide for the exhaustion  of  the  right  of  making
available. However, it should be noted  that  the  principle  of  exhaustion
only applies  to  the  right  of  distribution,  which  is  related  to  the
distribution of physical copies only, and  not  to  services,  such  as  the
making  available  and  sale  on-line.  Preventing  the   rightholder   from
prohibiting the resale would, therefore, be contrary  to  EU  Directives[33]
and international obligations, in particular  the  WCT,  the  WPPT  and  the
WTO/TRIPs  Agreement.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  list  of  permitted
exceptions contained in Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive and does  not  allow
for  additional  exceptions  to  be  introduced.  Moreover,  such  an  undue
limitation of the right of making available would also  be  a  violation  of
the  so-called  three-steps-test,  which  applies  to  all  exceptions   and
limitations to the rights and is included in  the  EU  Copyright  Directives
and the above-mentioned international treaties.


In the cinema industry, allowing the resale of digital content by law  would
seriously interfere with the market and  potentially  destroy  the  business
model on which our sector has  been  thriving.  Film  stakeholders  rely  on
sophisticated exclusive release  practices  (“release  windows”)  to  recoup
significant investments into content  production  and  promotion  along  the
life-cycle of a work. Release windows do not only exist in relation  to  the
theatrical release but also  in  the  VOD  segment,  where  films  are  made
available to consumers as download-to-own  or  as  streaming  options,  etc.
Applying the exhaustion rule to digital content would strip  the  sector  of
its ability to create value around its creations.


C.    Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[34]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[35].


15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU  level  help  in  the
    identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


YES. Cinema exhibitors support a system of  registration  for  identity  (as
opposed to registration of rights) but believe that  any  such  system  must
remain voluntary and operate in  full  compliance  with  applicable  EU  and
international norms. It is vital that rightholders  retain  their  exclusive
rights and contractual freedom.

Although aiming only at the identification  of  the  work  itself,  and  not
giving directly information about rights or rightholders involved,  standard
identifiers are key for the purpose of digital rights management. They  also
provide a single entry point to  those  databases  where  information  about
rights is stored (CMOs, public registries, rights libraries, etc.): this  is
especially  the  case  in  the   audiovisual   sector   with   ISAN,   ISO’s
International Standard Audiovisual work Number (see www.isan.org), which  is
today already broadly used by European producers’  and  authors’  collecting
societies.


The need for a more proactive approach on audiovisual identifiers  has  also
been confirmed during  the  “Licenses  for  Europe”  dialogue,  which  ended
notably  in  WG3  with  pledge  #  9  about  “improving  identification  and
discoverability of audio-visual content online”[36].



  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

A European policy supporting  implementation  of  international  identifiers
would enable better and more effective identification of  audiovisual  works
in the digital space and ease the licensing process.


  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

Should the consultation on the  contrary  consider  a  central  registration
system for rights, the disadvantages of such system would be numerous:

    • No legal certainty. Registration would only reflect claimed protection
      which is not proven and may not be upheld in court;
    • Costs and administrative  burden.  Registration  would  necessitate  a
      registration office, create laborious  administrative  processes,  and
      would not come for free;
    • Foreign rightholders would be at a disadvantage;
    • If the registration requirement were to apply to foreign  rightholders
      it would violate international obligations;
    • However,  if  foreign  rightholders  were  to  be  excluded  from  its
      application, it  would  leave  the  financial  burden  exclusively  on
      domestic rightholders.


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

Any incentives for  rightholders  would  have  to  come  from  the  inherent
benefits of the registration system itself.

D.    How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[37], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[38]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[39]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[40] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

The role of the EU should  be  to  continue  to  facilitate  discussion  and
encourage  marketplace  solutions   to   facilitate   interoperability   and
encourage the development of databases. The regulator should only  intervene
to mandate technological improvements in very  limited  circumstance.  Given
the efforts and progress in the private sector (eg. EIDR  and  UK  Copyright
Hub), cinema exhibitors do not believe the  case  has  been  made  for  more
extensive EU intervention in this space. We are encouraged  however  by  the
support of initiatives such as EIDR by EU institutions.

E.    Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[41]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

YES. Cinema exhibitors believe that the current terms of  protection  remain
appropriate and would like to underline that copyright is a  property  right
and  as  such  a  Fundamental  Right.  Any  attempts  to  shorten  terms  of
protection  would  raise  serious  questions  under  the   EU   Charter   on
Fundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms  as  well  as  in  relation  to  national
constitutions.

Copyright enables the creation of films as well as  significant  investments
into the production and distribution of filmed content.  Digital  technology
has not changed the  fact  that  these  activities  involve  high  financial
risks. The current terms provide means of  minimising  these  risks  on  the
basis that one major success can  compensate  many  attempts  which  do  not
succeed in the market place. Even in the case of a  success,  recoupment  of
the investment in for instance a film project may take decades.  Many  older
creative works have a very  long  economic  life  span:  recordings  of  the
Beatles or European films like those from Fritz  Lang  or  Federico  Fellini
continue to do very well on the market. Digital  technology  helps  in  this
context as it preserves works much better than before.  From  a  theoretical
perspective, the duration of copyright protection should, therefore,  rather
be longer in the digital environment, and not shorter.

In relation to the recently adopted Directive extending the term  for  music
performers and producers, we agree with the Commission’s  impact  assessment
that  the  economic  and  legal  situation  in  the  audiovisual  sector  is
significantly different to that of other sectors.

Finally, cinema exhibitors oppose the shortening or mitigation  of  existing
terms of protection given a clear lack of evidence that would validate  such
proposal.


III. Limitations & Exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[42].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[43].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[44], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[45],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[46].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.


21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
    Member States?

NO. Cinema exhibitors are not aware of any evidence regarding problems  with
respect to the optional nature of exceptions provided in  the  EU  Copyright
Acquis. The  EU  Copyright  Directive  sets  forth  an  exhaustive  list  of
exceptions and limitations, offering an important degree of  flexibility  to
each Member State and striking a fair balance between  cultural  differences
and requirements across Member States and  EU-wide  harmonisation.  In  line
with the subsidiarity principle, Member States adjust  their  national  laws
according to their identified needs,  their  legal  traditions  and  current
legal framework as well as to their cultural preferences. This includes  the
introduction of limitations or exceptions at national level.  Such  approach
reflects common practices at the international level.  Moreover,  the  Court
of  Justice  plays  an  important  clarifying  role  by  providing   uniform
interpretation of exceptions so that  there  has  also  been  a  significant
degree of convergence between legal systems. In the  absence  of  compelling
evidence demonstrating the need for change and of a  sound  legal  analysis,
the existing system should be maintained.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
    there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

NO. There is no reason nor is there a justification for  such  a  step.  The
principle of subsidiarity has to  be  respected.  The  exceptions  that  are
enshrined in the  copyright  Directives  (such  as  the  mandatory  ones  in
Directive 2009/24 and in Article 5(1) of  Directive  2001/29,  or  the  non-
mandatory ones) work well in practice (see above  on  question  21).  It  is
very important in this respect that the  list  of  exceptions  contained  in
Directive 2001/29 is exhaustive, so that Member States are  not  allowed  to
introduce new limitations/exceptions thereby enabling  a  certain  level  of
harmonisation.


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or  removed  from
    the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


There is no need to add or remove limitations  and  exceptions  to/from  the
existing catalogue which reflects a good compromise  at  EU  level.  It  has
been accepted by and  continues  to  be  acceptable  to  all  parties.  This
compromise  has  been  difficult  to  reach:  particular  examples  are  the
exceptions in the Software Directive 2009/24 for decompilation  and  back-up
copying or the exceptions in Directive 2001/29 for private copying,  on-site
consultation or technical copies (Article 5(1)).


EU law hence  provides  for  an  appropriate  (and  exhaustive,  see  above)
framework  of  limitations  and  exceptions  at  EU  level.  Any   necessary
adaptations may be applied by national law within this framework and do  not
necessitate  EU  legislation.  The  European  Court  of   Justice   is   the
appropriate institution to safeguard compliance  of  national  law  in  this
respect with EU law.


Modifying the EU framework for such adaptations  is  neither  necessary  nor
worth the while. Accordingly, the case for new exceptions at  EU  level  has
not been made. Moreover, any attempts of doing so would  only  risk  tilting
the delicate  balance  of  rights  and  other  interests  enshrined  in  the
Directives, and not respecting the  international  law  obligations  of  the
relevant treaties (Berne Convention, WCT, WPPT and TRIPs Agreement).


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide  for
    a greater degree of flexibility in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
    limitations and exceptions?
NO. Flexibility is already  an  important  component  of  the  EU  Copyright
Acquis. The current system provides  more  than  sufficient  flexibility  to
accommodate national preferences, developments in technology, new  uses  and
changing consumer demand.

25.   If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by  the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its  possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

As previously mentioned,  the  EU  legal  framework  on  copyright  provides
Member States and stakeholders with sufficient flexibility  while  providing
for the necessary degree of harmonisation.  When  discussing  the  issue  of
(more) flexibility, it should be noted, in particular, that the  necessarily
litigation intensive concept of "fair use" or "fair  dealing"  is  alien  to
the EU Directives and has no basis in international copyright law.  The  two
so-called "Internet Treaties" WCT and  WPPT  of  1996  already  provide  for
appropriate solutions for the protection of copyright  in  the  new  digital
environment and have deliberately not adopted this concept. In our view,  it
must not be adopted in EU law as it is contrary to the three-steps-test.


26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
   experience, constitute a problem?

NO. Due to the territoriality of copyright, the question of whether  or  not
a particular limitation or exception  is  relevant  to  a  specific  act  of
exploitation is a matter for the law where protection is  sought  (generally
where the use in question is taking  place).  This  is  also  in  line  with
international obligations and brings a significant degree of clarity.

27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
   level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of  “fair
   compensation” be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of  the
   exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Rights, as well as limitations and exceptions, apply to  the  relevant  acts
that  are  undertaken  in  the  territory  of  exploitation.   Consequently,
equitable  remuneration  or  fair  compensation  is  only  due  for  private
copying, public performance, public lending,  etc.,  if  the  relevant  acts
take place in the jurisdiction in question.

   A. Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[47] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[48].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[49].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.



1. Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.





28.  (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
    experienced specific problems  when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
    preserve and archive specific works or other  subject  matter  in  your
    collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

NO.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved? (Open question)

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be
   its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions
   should be covered and under which conditions? (Open question)

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would  it  be?
   (Open question)



JOINT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 28 to 31:

In our view, the case for further legislation in  this  area  has  not  been
made as the market is continuously developing. Cinema exhibitors are  deeply
committed to the preservation of Europe’s film  heritage  and  to  providing
access to it for cultural,  educational  and  research  purposes.  Voluntary
agreements regarding the interplay  between  copyright  exceptions  and  the
application of technological measures  are  already  encouraged  by  EC  law
(art. 6 (4) EUCD) and industry initiatives that  address  these  issues  are
continuously developing. Cinema exhibitors have  been  fully  supportive  of
recent market-led initiatives such as the work on  audiovisual  heritage  in
the  context  of  Licenses  for  Europe[50],  which  encouraged  contractual
arrangements between  rightholders  and  users  for  the  implementation  of
copyright exceptions. Cinema exhibitors  are  also  represented  in  the  EU
Cinema Expert Group on Film Heritage[51] of which  UNIC,  the  International
Union of Cinemas, is a member. We  also  note  the  important  role  of  the
recently adopted Orphan Works Directive[52].

We recognise that archives and film heritage institutions are interested  in
embracing digitisation by digitising their archives, making  them  available
online and projecting them in their cinematheques.  At  the  same  time  our
sector takes the view that  such  activities  should  not  go  beyond  their
public interest mission of collecting,  cataloguing,  preserving,  restoring
and making accessible for educational,  cultural,  research  or  other  non-
commercial uses cinematographic and other audiovisual works. Where  they  do
go beyond this mission, licensing will be relevant to avoid  a  conflict  of
interest with the normal exploitation of the work in  the  cinema  sector  –
starting with cinema exhibition.

2. Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary)  via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for  the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of  works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on  the  premises
of the  library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers.  Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the  possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.


32.   (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated
    agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to
    provide remote access, including across borders,  to the works or other
    subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and
    private study?If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
    (Open question)

33.   If there are problems, how would they best be solved? (Open question)
34.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
    should be covered and under which conditions? (Open question)
35.   If your view is that a different solution is  needed,  what  would  it
    be? (Open question)



JOINT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 32-35

Cinema exhibitors are concerned about the extension of Article  5(3)(n)  off
the premises of libraries and archives. We believe such arrangements  should
be dealt  with  by  common  licensing  mechanisms.  This  would  enable  all
stakeholders involved  to  ensure  that  only  intended  beneficiaries  have
access to specific works. It would also help  the  sector  to  prevent  that
protected works would be leaked online. There is also an important  risk  of
conflict of interest with the normal  exploitation  of  works  by  on-demand
services as well as by cinemas. Specific arrangements, including on a cross-
border basis, are already possible on the basis of the current acquis.

3. E-lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.


36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
   problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
   lending  (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  of  books  or   other
   materials held in your collection?


NO.

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

NO.

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

No opinion.

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
   you see in the management of physical and online  collections,  including
   providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do  you  see
   between   libraries’   traditional   activities   such   as   on-premises
   consultation or  public  lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises
   (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending?  What  problems  have
   you encountered?

[Open question][Also relevant for the off-premises access question  will  be
the general  argument  that  online  and  offline  lending  raise  different
issues] 

JOINT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 36-39

Cinema exhibitors take the view that legal action in this area and  at  this
point in time is not needed. The EC should encourage contractual  agreements
to address these activities and not limit exclusive rights of  rightholders.
To our knowledge, public lending of physical  goods  by  libraries  in  some
Member States reached such dramatic proportions that  the  market  for  DVDs
and CDs suffered from unfair competition in the past. Such  situation  could
of course be accelerated in the online environment and should be avoided.

4. Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[53].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[54].


40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
   engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective
   management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact
   legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
   agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have
   a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed
   across the EU?






41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
   agreed for other types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
   collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


NO. Cinema exhibitors take the view that the  EU  Copyright  acquis  strikes
the right balance in this regard and enables all stakeholders  of  the  film
sector  to  reach  constructive  inter-industry  agreements.   It   is   our
understanding that rightholders in the film sector have already  established
such agreements in the past.

   B. Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[55]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
   user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or
   other subject-matter for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
   borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

NO.

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]
44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
   content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

45. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements?  Which  activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
   should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]
46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

JOINT ANSWER TO QUESTIONS 42 TO 46

Cinema exhibitors are actively  involved  in  film  education  and  literacy
initiatives and support well-defined educational  exceptions  to  copyright
within the scope of the current acquis, including Articles 5 and 6  of  the
Copyright Directive. Our sector takes the view that the acquis strikes  the
appropriate balance in this context,  both  by  allowing  Member  States  a
certain flexibility to implement exceptions for illustration  for  teaching
purposes as well as  by  encouraging  licensing  solutions.  The  scope  of
Article 5(3) reflects the need for content owners to be able  to  negotiate
at arms-length with entities that are making available works  online  which
would conflict with  normal  exploitation  on  VOD  platforms  or  in  home
entertainment.

C.    Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[56]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
   user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or
   other subject matter in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
   including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

NO.


48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]


49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?

JOINT ANSWER TO QUESTIONS 47 TO 49

Cinema exhibitors take the view that the EU Copyright  Acquis  achieves  the
appropriate balance between necessary flexibility to  promote  research  and
the need to encourage and incentivise the creation of  new  creative  works.
Licensing schemes should be preferred as they protect against  the  possible
abuse of this exception for non-scholarly purposes  whilst  also  permitting
rightholders to address important issues such as quality and security.


D.    Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[57]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [58].

The Marrakesh Treaty[59] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).


50. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have  you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including  across  borders,  arising
from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

NO.

51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]


52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
to content? How successful are they?

JOINT ANSWER TO QUESTIONS 50 - 52

Cinema exhibitors do not believe that further  legislation  is  required  at
this time as the industry is deeply committed and fast-evolving  to  provide
equal access to those with disabilities.

In the case of cinema exhibition, digital cinema allows exhibitors to  offer
a range of new services and technologies for people with hearing and  visual
disabilities, provided that audio transcriptions and  narrative  tracks  are
delivered by  production/distribution.  Subtitling,  video  description  and
closed captions  (transcription  of  audio)  are  indeed  increasingly  made
available. New technologies are also being tested currently such as  eyewear
(“wifi glasses”) and cinema-specific apps.  It  is  our  understanding  that
similar advances and initiatives exist in other audiovisual version  markets
(incl. television, VOD, DVD, etc.)

In our view, Article 5(3)(b), which allows  for  different  kinds  of  uses,
strikes  the  appropriate  balance.  The  flexible  approach  taken  by  the
Directive can be adapted to  the  various  categories  of  copyright  works,
forms of distribution, and especially to the particular  needs  of  disabled
persons and their particular disability. Moreover, where  the  need  arises,
the system encourages supplemental  contractual  solutions  to  achieve  the
objective of better accessibility of audiovisual content  for  persons  with
disabilities.

Regarding the recent conclusion of the Marrakesh Treaty  for  the  Visually-
Impaired, we believe that the EU Copyright Acquis is already compliant  with
this  important  new  instrument.  The  Copyright  Directive  provides   the
necessary flexibility to enable EU signature and ratification. As a  result,
we do not share the view expressed in the Consultation Document.

E.    Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[60] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[61].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when  trying  to
use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

NO.

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

NO.

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

Cinema exhibitors oppose a broader EU  exception  for  commercial  text  and
data mining. There is a lack of evidence that  would  justify  an  exception
that goes beyond the existing one for non-commercial data-mining.   We  take
the  view  that  market-driven  solutions,  such  as  those  elaborated   by
publishers in the context of the Licenses for  Europe  dialogue[62],  should
be encouraged.  Furthermore,  a  commercial  exception  at  EU  level  would
potentially conflict with licensing  schemes  developed  by  publishers  and
other rightholders. We also believe that a broader  exception  would  hamper
copyright enforcement and could  pose  potential  dangers  to  operators  of
legitimate VOD services. Therefore, we oppose a  broader  EU  exception  for
commercial text and data mining.

F.    User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[63]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[64].


58.  (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
   experienced problems when trying  to  use  pre-existing  works  or  other
   subject matter to disseminate new  content  on  the  Internet,  including
   across borders?


(b)   [In particular if you are a service provider:]  Have  you  experienced
    problems when users publish/disseminate new content based on  the  pre-
    existing works or other subject-matter through your service,  including
    across borders?


(c)   [In particular if you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
    problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing  works
    or other subject-matter to disseminate new  content  on  the  Internet,
    including across borders?


Cinema exhibitors take the  view  that  the  EU  Copyright  Acquis  provides
sufficient flexibility for User-generated content (UGC) to thrive  and  that
no new exception  is  needed.  Potential  conflicts  between  copyright  and
freedom of expression  can  mostly  be  solved  by  existing  principles  of
copyright[65]. At the same time we regret that so-called UGC  platforms  use
the  Electronic  Commerce  Directive  on   hosting   to   avoid   any   real
responsibility with regard to widely disseminated content derived from  pre-
existing audiovisual works without asking the rightholders for permission.





59.  (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder:]
   Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure  that  the  work  you
   have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly  identified
   for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?

NO.


    (b)    [In particular if you are a service provider:]  Do  you  provide
    possibilities for users that  are  publishing/disseminating  the  works
    they have created (on the basis of  pre-existing  works)  through  your
    service to properly identify these works for online use?

NO.


60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder):]
   Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for  the  use
   of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?


NO.


(b)   [In particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
    remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works  they
    have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


NO.


61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


N/A


62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
   its main elements? Which activities should  be  covered  and  under  what
   conditions?

Cinema exhibitors take the  view  that  the  EU  Copyright  Acquis  provides
sufficient flexibility for User-generated content  (UGC)  to  thrive.  There
are several UGC sites operating in the EU including the  major  France-based
platform Dailymotion. This illustrates that EU rules and regulations  enable
the development  of  competitive  UGC  sites.  Potential  conflicts  between
copyright and freedom  of  expression  can  mostly  be  solved  by  existing
principles of copyright such as the  non-protection  of  ideas,  principles,
mere facts or data, the originality requirement and existing  exceptions  in
the Copyright Directive. Furthermore,  articles  5  (3)  (d),  (i)  and  (k)
provide necessary tools for Member States to enable UGC  creators  to  quote
protected works, engage in caricature, parody and pastiche  as  well  as  to
rely on exceptions in cases on incidental inclusion. Coupled with new micro-
licensing schemes and further industry-led  solutions  this  provides  ample
breathing space for UGC.  The initiative “UCG Principles” established  by  a
range of righholders is an example for such industry-led solution[66].

The view that no legislative solution is  needed  is  also  supported  by  a
recent EC study on the application of the Copyright Directive, given a  lack
of evidence pertaining to the need for new  exceptions  in  this  field[67].
Furthermore,  during   the   Licenses   for   Europe   initiative,   certain
participants of  the  relevant  Working  Group  equally  failed  to  provide
substantial evidence for the need of a legislative solution[68].

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Cinema exhibitors take the  view  that  the  EU  Copyright  Acquis  provides
sufficient flexibility for User-generated content  (UGC)  to  thrive.  There
are several UGC sites operating in the EU including the  major  France-based
platform Dailymotion. This illustrates that EU rules and regulations  enable
the development  of  competitive  UGC  sites.  Potential  conflicts  between

licensing schemes and further industry-led  solutions  this  provides  ample
breathing space for UGC.  The initiative “UCG Principles” established  by  a
range of righholders is an example for such industry-led solution[69].

of evidence pertaining to the need for new  exceptions  in  this  field[70].

IV.   Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[72]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[73]  [74].


There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
   application of the private copying  and  reprography  exceptions  in  the
   digital environment

NO. The relevant provisions regarding  these  exceptions  are  contained  in
Directive  2001/29.  They  are  sufficiently  clear  while  leaving   enough
flexibility to Member States as well as for the content sector  to  innovate
in  the  digital  environment.  Several  recitals  of  the   above-mentioned
Directive  explore  the  links  between  private  copying  and   reprography
exceptions and the application of technical protection measures and  examine
the application of both in a changing digital media landscape. A  number  of
CJEU decisions have furthermore confirmed current interpretations.




65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
   context of a service that has been licensed by  rightholders,  and  where
   the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be  subject  to  private  copying
   levies?

N/A

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
   services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for  instance,
   users to have copies on different devices)  impact  the  development  and
   functioning of new business models on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
   revenue on the other?

N/A

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
   for products subject to levies?[75]

YES. Making levies visible on invoices  for  products  subjected  to  levies
would provide more transparency to the consumer.

68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
   resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same  levy,
   or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

N/A

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to  persons  other
   than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to  private  copying?
   Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain  in
   detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of  transaction,
   stakeholders, etc.).
    (Open question)

70.  Where such undue payments arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
   affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
   reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to  remedy  the
   situation?
    (Open question)



71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

V.    Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[76] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[77]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.   [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
   mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that  you  receive  an
   adequate  remuneration  for  the   exploitation   of   your   works   and
   performances?

Cinema exhibitors embrace the notion of fair remuneration for  all  creative
professionals  that  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a  work.  They   pay
significant film rental fees as well as separate music  licensing  fees  for
music in films as well  as  for  music  played  in  cinema  auditoriums.  In
several European countries cinemas pay an additional cultural tax on  cinema
tickets directly to the film fund (12% in France for example) In  our  view,
when it comes to fair remuneration of creators, the  starting  point  should
be the exclusive right. It is the backbone of copyright/neighbouring  rights
protection and the bargaining chip for rightholders, vesting them  with  the
necessary negotiating power to obtain adequate  remuneration.  We  therefore
believe that the best  mechanism  to  ensure  that  authors  and  performers
receive adequate remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  their  works  and
performances  is  by  means  of  contractual  agreements  /  individual  and
collective   negotiations.   Mandatory    collective    administration    of
remuneration rights should be avoided, if possible.


73.   Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
   certain clauses in contracts)?

NO. The list of film authors is covered by the  Term  Directive  and  cinema
exhibitors take the view that there is no  need  to  act  at  EU  level.  We
believe that in this domain the principle of  subsidiarity  should  prevail.
Member States should deal with specific questions, if needed.

73. If you consider that the current rules are not  effective,  what  would
    you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

We think the  current  rules  are  effective.  They  allow  film  producers,
authors  and  performers  alike  to  be  flexible,  innovative  and  act  in
accordance with their values.

VI.   Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[78] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[79].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[80]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[81].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

74. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
    efficient for infringements of copyright committed  with  a  commercial
    purpose?

Cinema exhibitors take the view that copyright infringements  harm  cultural
diversity and  the  cultural  and  creative  industries  and  have  negative
impacts on rightholders, consumers  and  public  institutions.  We  strongly
support  strict  enforcement  against  commercial  scale  infringement.  The
Enforcement Directive (Directive 2004/48/EC)  already  includes  obligations
on sanctions and remedies for intellectual property infringements.




75. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
   providers, advertising brokers, payment service  providers,  domain  name
   registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online  copyright  infringements  with  a
   commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to  foster  the
   cooperation of intermediaries?

YES.  Article  8(3)  is  an  effective  tool  to   foster   cooperation   of
intermediaries  against  copyright  infringements.  Our  main   concern   is
therefore the correct implementation of Article 8(3) by all  Member  States.
Unfortunately, this is not yet the case.

76. Does the current civil enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
    balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected
    and other rights such as the protection of private life and  protection
    of personal data?


YES. Several provisions and Recitals of the Copyright Directives and of  the
Enforcement Directive already explicitly enable Member States to  ring-fence
the protection of private life and personal data.  All  Member  States  have
implemented the Directives in due respect of this protection. Moreover,  the
obligations under these Directives are handled in practice  in  a  pragmatic
manner and have not given rise to problems or complaints in this respect.

The ECJ has clarified in several recent verdicts that national  courts  have
to  apply  the  proportionality  test  in  order  to  take  account  of  all
fundamental rights. Given the breath of case law on this topic and the  fact
that national courts are effectively  applying  the  required  balancing  of
fundamental rights there are sufficient safeguards in place to  ensure  just
outcomes.

VII.  A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

77. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright  Title,
    as a means of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
    exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as  a  single  framework
    for enforcement?

NO. The introduction of a single EU Copyright Title would  not  produce  the
intended  results  and  is  a  rather   unrealistic   undertaking   in   our
perspective. The current system works and takes account of differing  market
conditions, legal traditions, cultural specificities and copyright  concepts
across EU Member States. A new  legislative  instrument  alongside  national
titles would add a layer of complexity if  not  confusion.  Furthermore,  we
believe that a single EU Copyright Title could potentially lead to  unlawful
cases of property expropriation in many Member States given that the  levels
of protection vary from Member State to Member State.

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?

The EU Copyright framework is extensive, flexible and sufficient.  There  is
no evidence for establishing such title. Pursuing  the  objective  would  be
the wrong approach to take.

VIII.       Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal  framework
   for copyright? Please explain and indicate how  such  matters  should  be
   addressed.

consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[35] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-

opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
