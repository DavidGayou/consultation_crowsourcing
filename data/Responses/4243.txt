            I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider

context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

             I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
        trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
        which you live?

  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
 of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
 visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
 applications and other software)

 Yes. I often shop for games at an online store called GamersGate. I normally use the
 Swedish site, since I am located in Sweden. Sometimes I get directed to the UK website
 when I search for games, and then it is usually the case that the game in question is only
 available to customers in the UK. Examples include titles like Battlefield 4 and Drakensang:
 the Dark Eye. I can see that those titles are available on the UK web site, but I am not
 allowed to purchase them since I am located in Sweden.

  NO OPINION



     2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
        seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

  YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
 or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
 borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
 indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
 content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
 magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

      possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
      Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
      what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

Several of the problems with making content available to consumers stem from exclusive
license agreements, where one company or organisation is granted exclusive rights to sell a
product to the detriment of the market. Examples of this include that “Game of Thrones”
may only be available by subscribing to a whole TV channel as happened in Australia
(essentially bundling, something I believe is illegal), footage from the olympic games only
being broadcast on a pay channel in Sweden, etc.

The solution is simple: introduce compulsive licensing, where rights holders cannot deny
companies to use content they own the rights to as long as a legally established fee is paid.
Obviously rights holders won't like that – but the purpose of copyright law is not to cater to
right holders only.



   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for
      all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
      impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
      ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
      countries)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there
      reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for
      all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
      impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to
      redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION



   7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
      market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
      availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
      level of protection for right holders?

 YES – Please explain

Laws like German bans on showing images associated with Nazi Germany should be
harmonised to make it very clear that a content provider outside of Germany can never be
held accountable for what someone in Germany might do with content provided by said
provider. There should be no necessity for someone outside of Germany to filter their
content to account for local German laws. German laws might of course apply to any user in
Germany.

The same goes for ANY national censorship laws, be it Swedish bans on gambling sites or
some other country's definition of child pornography. In all cases, it should be firmly
established that national laws only apply to people in that nation – and censorship laws in
general should be frowned upon.

 NO – Please explain

     NO OPINION

   E.Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
   authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

1. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
   The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
   environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
   field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
   software17 and databases18.

   Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
   are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
   protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
   networks.

   The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
   authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
   e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
   at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
   communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
   dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
   transmissions and both need to be cleared.

2. The act of “making available”

   Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
   upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
   “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
   territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
   need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
   only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
   countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
   Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of

   16
      Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
   certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
   17
      Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
   of computer programs.
   18
      Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
   databases.
   19
      Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
   respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
   referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
   matter”.
   20
      The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
   in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
   a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   21
      The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
   or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
                                                                                                                   12
a certain Member State's public 22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

     8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
        content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

  YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
 required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
 approach23)

  NO OPINION



     9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
        scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your

   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

   Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
   law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
   transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
   licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
   persons/entities.

        10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
            two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
            a download) create problems for you?

     YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such

4. Linking and browsing

   Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
   They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
   pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
   a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
   public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
   A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
   works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
   memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 26 as to whether such
   copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
   provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

        11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
            protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
            subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)

Linking to something is akin to saying “you can borrow the book you want from the
library”. Telling other people where information or content is available should never, ever,
be subject to approval of a rights holder.

Just to show how ludicrous this thought is, consider that this document contains several
links to web pages that are most likely subject to copyright. Have the writer of this
document secured permission from the respective rights holders to publish those links? I
seriously doubt that.

Linking is just too common an action to make it reasonable to require the legal overhead of
securing permission from the right holder.

Yes, of course this may make it easier to facilitate violations of copyright. On the other
hand, copyright can be – and has already been – used to silence criticism, basically
hampering free speech.

When weighting those two considerations against each other – damage to free speech or to
the interests of some copyright holders – I firmly think that free speech is the more
important consideration.

There is no way to know beforehand what will be shown when you choose to browse to a
web page. Indeed, there is a tradition in some circles (Slashdot, for example) to link to
shocking content while using a very innocent description. For example, someone might post
a link that says “cute kittens” while linking to pornographical images of pussies. One of the
most popular memes is “Goatse”, see:

                                                                                           15

    (Oh, did I just commit a crime since I did not secure permission from Wikipedia to post a
    link to their content? See how silly it sounds to have to do that every time you include a
    link?)

    Making anyone legally responsible for actions whose results are impossible to predict is
    idiotic. Moreover, it throws the door wide open to abuses of different kinds. Tricking other
    people to click on links to your own content, only in order to then threaten legal action if
    they do not pay your fees is nothing more than a legally endorsed extortion racket. No

5. Download to own digital content

   Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
   Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
   (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
   distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
   article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
   distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
   also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
   (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
   notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
   keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
   the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
   a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
   second-hand market for physical goods).

        13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
            trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

     In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
   hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
   period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
   exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
   case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
   emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
   exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
   56).

F.Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

G.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?

H.Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

        20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
            environment?
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 Uh.....no?

 I am terribly sorry, but the question is monumentally stupid! Of course the current terms are
 too long! In the digital environment, things move fast enough that a product is relevant for
 10 years AT BEST. The "digital environment" itself has existed for barely 20 years, and it
 has gone throught several generations of standards during that short time. Just to pick one
 example, there have been AT LEAST 4 major generations of Microsoft operating systems
 released in that time (DOS/Windows 3, Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows 7), each
 operating system only partially compatible with the previous one. The end result is that
 programs that are 20 years old are almost impossible to run any more - and even things that
 are 10 years old is problematic.

 It is quite obvious that most old stuff is no longer commercially viable. Are there any stores
 in existence that sells MicroSoft DOS these days? Programs for DOS? Yet, the copyright
 for DOS will be valid for a minimum of about 20 more years. The ONLY effect of
 copyright here is to make it harder for niche users.

 But, what about movies and music? Aren't they relevant longer than computer programs?
 Well, yes and no. Sure, there's still interest in movies and music made 20 or 30 or even 50
 or 150 years ago. That's not really relevant. The purpose of copyright is to allow the creator
 a window of opportunity to monetize his investment. It is NOT a mechanism for ownership
 of ideas and expressions.

 Formerly, distribution was a real problem and it took months or even years from the US
 release of a movie to the European release of the same movie. The digital environment has
35
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
                                                                                                                 19
 changed this for the better. Information can now be sent across the globe instantaneousy,
 and movies premiere globally. Companies may now even dispense with middlemen and set
 up a store on the internet that will be able to distribute globally, and marketing campagns
 can similarily have a global reach instead of a local or national reach. Simply put, since it is
 now much simpler, faster and cheaper to monetize your investment - less time should be
 given to the creator to do so. If they can recoup their investment and turn a profit in 5 years,
 copyright terms longer than that are damaging to the industry and only provide incentive to
 rest on your laurels rather than creating new stuff!

 Yes, there is stuff that may not turn a profit in 10 years. That's called a "loss". Such things
 happen, and copyright terms should not extended in vain attempts to make sure that
 everyone who has ever created anything will be able to turn a profit. That's impossible,
 anyway, since some things stink so much they won't sell no matter how long you wait.
 Instead, a movie/song should only be under copyright for as long as it is commercially
 relevant. If you need to know how long that is, just consider how long it takes for something
 to move from the top-10 lists and to the bargain bin. That happens within 2-3 years in the
 world of today, and is an indicator that copyright need not last much longer than that.

 10 years is plenty. 5 years may be possible. 50 or 70 years or even longer is ridiculous and
 an affront to civilized society.

             I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38 Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
                                                                                                            20
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-

orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

[Open question]

Yes.

Emulators and programs that circumvent DRM restrictions should be explicitly allowed,
even if they contain copyrighted content, since they allow us all to actually USE content
we've bought that is no longer supported by the company that sold us the content in the first
place.

Example: I am not thrilled by the prospect of losing access to my library of 50+ PlayStation
2 games when the hardware eventually dies and I can't buy another PlayStation 2 machine.
Neither am I thrilled by the prospect of not being to watch old movies if the DVD
encryption scheme (CSS) is ever in danger of not being supported by future video players.

Giving the group that owns the copyright of industry standards control over all content
produced for several decades is....well, I'm at a loss for words. Stupid? Incredibly stupid?
Monumentally stupid? Catastrphic? Disastrous? No, none of those are really string enough
to convey my feelings on the matter. Standards need to be open. Nobody should be allowed
to own copyright on the standards and mechanism necessary to access content that I legally
own.

      establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
      of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
      matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
      limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
      governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

      Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
      envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
      the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
      exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
      rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
      stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

      The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
      cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
      works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
      works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
      laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
      from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
      types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
      of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
      new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
      content) is often uncertain.

           28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
               problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
               or other subject matter in your collection?
       (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
       by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
       exception?
        YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

1. Off-premises access to library collections
   Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
   matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
   premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
   consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
   the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
   between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
   should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
   collections.
        32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
           problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
           to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts

2. E – lending
   Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
   also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
   technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
   such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
   need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
   various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
   business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
   to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
       36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
          when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
          including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
    including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
    to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

3. Mass digitisation
   The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
   libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
   an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
   Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
   whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
   EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
   digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
   found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation

                                                                                                   27
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

     40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
         mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
         Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
         results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
         collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can
         be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

I.Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

        42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-
            matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their

States level.

K.Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

     50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation
         representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with
         accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States’

L.Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).


51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.
                                                                                                32
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

     53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
         you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data
         mining methods, including across borders?
 (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
 copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including
 across borders?

M.User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.
                                                                                                           34
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

     58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced

 As a hobbyist, I have maintained several reference compilations of things like rule questions
 (in games and sports) and other things related to my hobbies. Things like that are done in
 order to provide a resource not provided by the owner of the content, for example a well
 organized, searchable and electronic compilation of questions that had only been published

 Unfortunately, there's always the Sword of Damocles represented by copyright rules
 hanging over your head. You know that you are providing a valuable service that in no way
 competes with the interests of the rights holder – quite the opposite, it often generates more
 interest for the subject matter and thus more income for the rights holder. Until, one day, the
 rights holder has a brain aneurysm and decide they need to “protect their copyright”, or start
 threatening loyal fans for some other reason.

            I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

        21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
            the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
  YES – Please explain

 Yes, very much so. Additionally, there is a need to enact laws to ensure several consumer
 rights, regardless of DRM restrictions.

 Let's take one example: I like to play games, and have done so for quite a while. Some
 games I have are over 20 years old - and I still like to play them every once in a long while.
 Old Sierra games like Leasure Suit Larry (published in 1987), Master of Orion (1993) and
 Master of Magic (1994) are all games that I have enjoyed playing again during 2013.

 How to enjoy these games now, 20 years later? Current computers don't run these games
 without the use of an emulator, a program that simulates how a 1990's era computer worked.
 Unfortunately, that may mean including code from those computers that is still under
 copyright. Additionally, emulators are often attacked by copyright holders who accuse them
 of facilitating unlawful copying. Last of all, emulators may run afoul of legal clauses that
 forbid programs that “circumvent technical protections” of works.

 A few years later, I bought a PlayStation 2 and a huge library of games for it. In fact, I made
 it a point to buy games cheap when I could - with a mind to play them later when I had the
 time. It is now 2014. My PlayStation 2 is about 10 years old and showing signs that it may
 be failing. If it breaks, I don't really know what to do! Sony, the company that produced the
 console, has not made their newer consoles compatible with the old games so I can buy a
 new console. Finding someplace to buy a new PlayStation 2 console is hard, and will
 eventually be impossible.

 At that time, my game collection would die if it weren't for the existence of emulators.
 Naturally, the PS2 emulators are as much under attack from the copyright industry as other
 emulators. They are also needlessly complex to use since there is some copyrighted content
 (the BIOS of the PlayStation 2) necessary in order to run the emulator. In order to legally
 run the emulator I now use, I need to jump through some fairly daunting technical hoops –
 all for the sake of protecting Sony's nonexistent business of selling PS2 consoles and
 games!

 Now, I haven't even mentioned stuff that is even older. Back in those days, games were
 played on arcade machines where you would put in coins in order to play once. You never
 bought the actual games themselves. If you'd like to play those games again today, you're
 simply screwed. Even if you spent a small fortune playing Gauntlet in 1985 you didn't own
 the game and have no right to play it today - and nobody is offering to legally sell it to you!

 Simply put, even 10 years is long enough that the game industry has moved on and don't
 support the stuff they sold. They'd rather have me buy NEW stuff instead. But that is
 asinine! Consider the music and movie industries: is it really the case that nobody listens to
 music from the 1980's? Watch movies? Of course people still like old stuff!

 In this field, it needs to be clarified that emulators and other programs that make it possible
 to watch/play old stuff is perfectly legal. They should be allowed to contain copyrighted
 content (or copyright should not be honored for things like the BIOS of a PlayStation 2) or
58
     Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
                                                                                               38
 copyright should simply expire in a reasonable amount of time (70 years is riduculous when
 the industry isn't interested in supporting 10 year old stuff).

 Moreover, DRM means that we will lose our past. As soon as the equipment that allows us
 to play DRM'd content fails, you cannot enjoy that content anymore if the industry that
 controls the copyright for the DRM in question will refuse to sell us replacement equipment.
 That is simply not acceptable! Programs that allow us to circumvent DRM should therefore
 also be legal (preferably without any time limit, but at the very least after a reasonable
 amount of time rather than the 50 or 70 years that copyright lasts).

 Sweden has had a “tape tax” that is a a form of private copying levy for some time now. It
 originated as a tax on cassette tapes, then was extended to CDs, DVDs, flash memory, hard
 drives and other storage media. It's not a positive thing for several reasons:

 A. It ruins the business of selling blank media. It used to be the case that people bought
 blank media locally, but when the tax was enacted for CDs everyone started ordering blank
 media from Denmark (where there is no tax). The end result was that it hurt local
 businesses.

 B. The tax is unfair since not all users will use the blank media to store copyrighted content.
 It may have been somewhat reasonable when recording equipment was not common, but
 today when everyone has a camera and a recorder in their smartphones as well as numerous
 other ways to generate their own content, it isn't a reasonable to tax computer hard drives
 with the assumption that they will be used to make private copies of copyrighted content.

         business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
 [Open question]

 Is the goal of legislation to worry about rightholders' revenue?!?

 Private copying has been going on practically forever, and right holders have whined about
 it the whole time. If their doomsday stories (“Home taping is killing music”) were true they
 would have gone out of business a long time ago. They haven't – but they HAVE delayed
 the adoption of new technology and generally hurt technical progress along the way.

 Private copying levies are unnecessary and can do nothing but hurt technological progress
 that happen in spite of copyright, rather than because of it.



     24. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
        products subject to levies?60
  YES – Please explain

 copyright industry when we get a new memory card for our cameras, or a new hard drive for
 our computer. An informed public is always a good thing.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

     25. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in

                I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the

     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
                                                                                             41
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

        21. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or

 Allowing the transfer of ownership of rights from an individual (a weak party) to a
 multinational corporation (a very strong party) is damaging since it creates a situation that is
 ripe for abuse. Creators are cheated/tricked/strongarmed into giving up their rights and have
 few means to prevent this since they are the weaker party. The end result is that the lion's
 part of any profit ends up in the hands of middlemen that frankly are no longer necessary in

             I.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

     21. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
         infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain

 “Efficient” is mostly a way to say “screw due process” and therefore I am always scared by
 people wanting “justice” to be dispensed more effectively. No thanks. The system is already
 much too “effective” when rights holders can engage in legal extortion without
 repercussions.

  NO OPINION


     22. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
         involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
         brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
         online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
         would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
 [Open question]
 The current system is bad as it is, with rights holders being able to get internet service
 providers and sites for sharing user-created content (such as YouTube) to censor people at
 will by claiming they own copyright to something.

   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
                                                                                                           43
It would be a marked improvement to bring this back to the courts and away from
intermediaries.


    23. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
        achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
        as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain

Not in the least.

First of all, the copyright duration is simply ludicrous! 50 or 70 years when the commercial
relevancy is measured in months, or some years at best? That is nothing but a crutch that
allows copyright holders to either kill old content in order not to have to compete with it, or
extort money from owning a monopoly on selling something that costs essentially nothing
to provide (most content has covered the cost of investment associated with it LONG before
copyright expires).

Second, the IPRED directive has given copyright holders a "fast track justice system" where
traditional values like due process goes out the window. Simply put, the copyright industry
has been given a license to dispense "justice" at their own leisure, acting as both police and
judge, and bypassing the legal process. Examples include:

    • "three strikes" laws that may get someone blocked from using the internet on mere
       ACCUSATIONS from the copyright industry.

    • The ability of the copyright industry to request information from communication
       carriers, a power that can be easily abused and is therefore normally the purview of
       the police.

    • Lawsuit bullying, when copyright holders may extort money from essentially random
       people by threatening to sue since they know that the justice system is ridiculously
       tilted in their favor by never punishing them for making false accusations.

Copyright infringement is a nuisance crime at best, and it is doubtful whether it is hurting
the industry AT ALL. The industry certainly hasn't failed because of it, even though they've
been claiming that "the sky is falling" for over 100 years. (Yes, I actually mean that literally
– they were whining about self-playing pianos that long ago) THAT is the social problem
that REQUIRES suspension of due process and the introduction of a fast-track system that
makes it easier for the rights holders to extract more money from society at large?!? It's
insane!

              I.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

    21. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as

        copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
