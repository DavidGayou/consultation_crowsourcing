   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

CEPI would like to highlight that consumers are well served  when  it  comes
to access to online services. There  are  a  plethora  of  services  at  the
national level  and  some  cross-border  services.  However,  generally  the
number of services available at the  national  level  is  far  greater  than
those provided across borders. The copyright framework does not prevent  the
availability of multi-territory  or  pan-European  licenses.  Instead,  such
services are limited by the nature of demand in Europe which  is  fragmented
by culture and language. As a consequence there is little  demand  for  non-
national content and the costs of  operating  in  multiple  territories  are
extremely high.


The European film and  television  markets  are  heterogeneous,  divided  by
language and culture. This has fragmented consumer preferences  with  demand
for national and local content first, then  international  blockbusters  and
series, and finally non-national content such as TV programmes  produced  in
other European member states.  Consumer  tastes  are  often  very  specific,
shaped by events, fashions or even the social climate in the member  states.
This has made it difficult for TV programmes and films to cross borders.  It
has also meant distribution costs are  far  higher  as  any  broadcaster  or
distributor will need to  adapt  to  the  specific  conditions  within  each
member state. This will require specific marketing strategies  and  detailed
knowledge of local and national  market  and  regulatory  conditions.  Often
when an audiovisual work is distributed across  borders  it  will  obtain  a
smaller return then in their country of origin. Success stories such as  The
Killing relied on high ratings  in  Denmark  before  they  were  distributed
internationally. This is often a prerequisite given the  high  levels  costs
and risks involved.


The unique nature of demand for audiovisual works in Europe has  meant  that
the majority of producers, broadcasters,  and  distributors  are  small  and
medium  sized  enterprises.  This  is  true  of  CEPI’s  members   who   are
independent producers  working  in  specific  national  contexts,  providing
content  which  speaks  to  local   cultural   identities   and   linguistic
preferences. For new online services we are witnessing  the  same  trend  as
online services concentrate on specific national markets.


Licenses are therefore generally sold on a single territory basis and  there
is very  little  demand  both  from  consumers  and  service  providers  for
licenses covering several territories. In some cases there is a  demand  for
such services particularly with common  linguistic  areas  and  the  English
language.  Services  are  provided  for  these  communities  and  CEPI   has
committed to examining new solutions in the  Licenses  for  Europe  process.
The audiovisual industry is also examining new business  models  which  take
advantage of new online services. However, whilst online services  have  the
potential to distribute in multiple territories they are  still  limited  by
demand. We are examining different business models but it is not  clear  yet
whether these services will  actually  provide  a  significant  opportunity.
Much depends  on  their  ability  to  contribute  to  the  pre-financing  of
production much like broadcasters are currently doing.


We would also like to highlight that consumers face  many  challenges  which
are not related to licensing and which could undermine access. The  question
posed here could lead the Commission to draw the conclusion that a  lack  of
access means a licensing issue exists. For example, one of  the  most  cited
issues for consumers are poor or weak broadband connections  or  high  costs
of access.

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

Consumers have access to a far greater number of services in the  EU  member
states than ever before. They are able to access the national  content  they
want  and  where  there  is  a  demand  for  content  across  borders,   the
audiovisual industry provides access. For example broadcasters  are  already
providing cross-border services in some cases, as the  Licences  for  Europe
stakeholder dialogue demonstrated (particularly Working Group  1  on  cross-
border portability). However, often service  providers  are  prevented  from
delivering  services  across  borders  because  of  the  nature  of  demand.
Consumers tend to favour national content over non-national content and  the
specificities of their demands  makes  it  costly  to  provide  services  in
several member states. The cost of providing services are also  affected  by
piracy,  VAT  rates,  consumer  protection  and  rules  protecting   minors,
hardware penetration and micro-payment facilities can  inhibit  the  ability
of services to provide content to consumers.


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


CEPI’s members rarely receive requests for  multi-territorial  licenses.  As
already illustrated the current copyright  framework  does  not  prevent  us
from granting such licenses. We find that culture differences  and  language
have shaped the industry on a territorial basis. Preferences tend to be  for
non-national and local audiovisual works which do not travel  easily  across
borders. Furthermore, broadcasters and distributors often  face  high  costs
in multiple territory distribution as a  detailed  understanding  of  market
and regulatory conditions is required. We  do  sometimes  grant  territories
for multiple licenses when a  broadcaster  or  distributor  is  targeting  a
common linguistic area.


In addition to culture and language, a number of other  issues  exist  which
affect broadcasters and distributors.  These  include,  VAT  rates,  piracy,
micro-payment  facilities,  rules  protecting  consumers  and  minors,   and
relevant hardware penetration.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


There is very little demand for cross-border services except in the case  of
Diaspora communities. However, the audiovisual industry is  already  working
towards providing  access  for  these  communities  as  illustrated  by  the
outcome of working group one in License for  Europe.  The  demand  for  non-
national content is extremely low and it is extremely  costly  for  services
to operate in multiple territories. As  a  consequence  CEPI  see  very  few
requests for multi-territorial licensing.


The market is best placed to meet the  demand  for  audiovisual  content  in
Europe. Current  there  are  multiple  national  services  offering  content
tailored to the specific cultural and linguistic requirements.  Furthermore,
in cases where there is a demand for cross-border services, the industry  is
working towards developing new business models.  This  was  demonstrated  by
the Licenses  for  Europe  stakeholder  dialogue,  where  the  industry  has
committed to developing more solutions to this  small  demand  for  national
content abroad. New technologies and technical problems are currently  being
examined. For example, CEPI was signatory to a  Joint  Statement  on  Cross-
border  Portability  of  lawfully-acquired  Audiovisual  Content  signed  by
several European-level associations  which  stated  their  interest  in  the
development of cross-border portability of  legally  acquired  content,  the
need for commercial and contractual freedoms, and the need for  a  voluntary
market-led approach to allow new business models to develop.


However, the European Commission can still  play  a  role  in  other  areas.
Whilst licensing is not an issue,  the  continued  detrimental  effect  that
piracy has on value of a work needs to be address. Furthermore,  as  already
highlighted,  VAT  issues,  micro-payment  facilities,   relevant   hardware
penetration and consumer protection rules also need analysing.








   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples


Market and regulatory conditions have  meant  that  licensing  tends  to  be
territorial rather than  multi-territorial.  However,  any  policy  decision
should also take into  account  the  contractual  freedom  to  organise  the
exploitation of a film and TV  programme.  The  producer  and  the  relevant
distributors will often examine how best to respond to the local demand  and
each territory for exploitation is specifically selected  based  on  whether
the film or TV programme will be successful there.


Production is extremely high risk and  is  dependent  upon  high  levels  of
investment. This investment is often obtained prior to the  actual  shooting
of a film of TV programme. As a  consequence  most  productions  rely  on  a
specific  financing  system  based  on  a   guarantee.   Rights   are   sold
specifically by platform,  territory  and  language  and  based  on  a  very
specific  business  model  which  is  designed   to   fully   optimise   the
exploitation of a work. This  business  model  considers  where  the  demand
exists  and  also  specific  cultural  and  linguistic  factors.  Often  the
producer will grant territorial exclusivity to a broadcaster or  distributor
in exchange for a high level of investment. Private investors will  look  at
the guarantee as evidence that they will recoup the  investment  they  make.
Without this guarantee the level of investment would be  low  and  important
works may never be produced.  The  contractual  freedom  currently  provided
under EU copyright law therefore allows  for  a  flexible  financing  system
which allows the producer to maximise the exploitation of a work.

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,

      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

There is a misunderstanding  in  the  reason  for  the  rare  occurrence  of
licensing  for  multiple  territories.  This  is  not  due  to  the  current
copyright framework, but to  the  demand  of  such  licenses.  Cultural  and
linguistic diversity and the high costs  involved  in  the  distribution  of
audiovisual material in multiple territories make the markets  in  different
member states have specific preferences. Licensing models ought to  be  left
to the market-place, where demand and supply meet each other.  If  there  is
little to  no  demand,  as  is  currently  the  case  for  multi-territorial
licensing, it makes no sense to impose supply. Contractual freedom, as  well
as  exclusive  rights  that  are  established  in  EU  copyright  law,  make
commercial negotiations perfectly viable for meeting demand for licenses  in
multiple territories.


In  fact,  we  think  that  legislation  which  obliges   broadcasters   and
distributors  to  make  audiovisual  content  available  multi-territorially
through European-wide channels will have  little  effect.  Since  demand  is
mainly  driven  by  Diaspora  communities,  the  benefits  are   negligible.
Moreover, focusing on Diasporas could curb integration and  foster  cultural
separation. In the case of some communities, the  creative  industries  have
already found solutions where they are commercially viable.  The  Commission
should acknowledge that the market works,  and  should  base  its  decisions
with  the  understanding  of  culturally  diverse  consumption   preferences
throughout Europe that are present in legacy media.


The  introduction  of  pan-European  licenses  could  even  be  harmful   to
audiovisual producers. The creative  industry  behind  film  and  television
productions relies  on  a  financial  model  that  has  proved  to  make  it
successful. Undermining the business  models  behind  this  would  seriously
interrupt creativity. Each film is a prototype and the making of a  film  or
television  show  is  an  R&D  process  that  involves  developing  scripts,
casting, location,  scouting  and  production  designs.  Producers  have  to
invest significantly to enable this process, even before a first  frame  has
been shot. It is quite common for films to be abandoned in  an  early  stage
because of the high costs involved. Investors like the producers bear  these
costs.  The  prototypical  nature  of  audiovisual  productions   makes   it
impossible  to  determine  which  will  become  a  success  and  which  not.
Unpredictable factors play a big role, such as social climate,  trends,  and
contemporary culture. Only one in ten  films  actually  makes  a  return  on
their investment.


Next to producers, other investors are involved in the process of film-  and
television show-making, so the risk and high levels of  finance  are  spread
to some extent. The audiovisual content is produced  for  a  certain  public
and then the  rights  are  sold  to  local  distributors  per  platform  and
territory, as to  play  into  linguistic  and  cultural  preferences.  These
broadcasters and distributors know how to market  and  distribute  in  their
specific territories, where the film is most likely to be  successful.  This
system  allows  for  producers  to  adapt  to  the  dynamics  of   different
territories and to  specialize  a  production  for  a  certain  market.  The
contractual freedom that is in place ensures  that  investors  are  able  to
choose territories for which a production is made. This incentive to  invest
in a sector that had a turnover of €129  billion  in  2010,  was  served  by
126,000 SMEs and employed 560,000 people, playing such a  big  part  in  the
European economy, should not be reduced by pan-European licensing. [1]


From a cultural point of view, licensing to such an extent  could  undermine
the diversity that so characterizes the European continent, as it will  lead
to a homogenization of both language and culture. Very  few  platforms  will
be  able  to  afford  the  acquisition  and  market  costs  of  pan-European
distribution which are particularly high in Europe due  to  specific  market
and regulatory differences. It would push producers to create  content  that
is closest to a common cultural denominator.


In 2006, the Council adopted the UNESCO Convention  on  the  Protection  and
Promotion of the Diversity  of  Cultural  Expressions.  The  recognition  on
cultural diversity in Europe was later also embedded in  Articles  6[2]  and
167(2)[3] of the TFEU, stating that the Commission shall “contribute to  the
flowering of the cultures of  the  Member  States,  while  respecting  their
national  and  regional  diversity”.  Pan-European  licenses  will  have   a
negative effect on the blossoming of the cultures of all 28  member  states,
as it ignores the national and regional diversity of the Union.


Generally  speaking,  the  audiovisual  demand  requested  by  consumers  is
available to them via a variety of  linear  and  non-linear  media.  In  the
cases where there is demand for cross-border content, the market is  leading
to solutions, which is always the right direction. The audiovisual  industry
has been investing in  new  online  distribution  channels  that  complement
existing linear channels. As has  been  highlighted  by  the  sector  during
Licenses for Europe, steps have been taken to improve the access to  content
for Diaspora communities.


The continued  development  of  successful  business  models  which  provide
culturally diverse  content  across  borders  is  often  affected  by  other
factors  than  consumer  demand,  including  the   lack   of   micro-payment
facilities, consumer protection rules, relevant  hardware  penetration,  VAT
rates, and piracy. CEPI thinks that  the  Commission  can  play  a  role  in
improving these conditions  which  play  an  inherent  part  of  audiovisual
creation. We are very pleased by the Creative Europe programme  and  the  60
percent ceiling for difficult cross-border films introduced into the  Cinema
Communication recently.


It is the creativity and innovation of the audiovisual sector  which  drives
the production and  distribution  across  borders  of  content.  The  future
development of the European film industry will  depend  on  these  qualities
and policy should focus on supporting the industry  rather  than  inhibiting
its development.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

The current scope of the “making available” right has  been  beneficial  for
CEPI’s members. Therefore, any decision to  alter  it  should  be  carefully
considered. Of particular concern for CEPI is  the  potential  extension  of
the Cable  and  Satellite  Directive  to  the  online  world  entailing  the
implementation of the country  of  origin  principle.  CEPI  would  like  to
stress that this would seriously undermine the ability  of  our  members  to
enforce our rights.


First of all it is  important  to  note  that  all  the  rights  needed  for
exploitation are usually  collated  with  the  producer.  As  a  consequence
determining the author  is  not  an  issue.  However,  the  freedom  of  the
producer to  manage  rights  on  a  territorial  basis  must  be  respected.
Contractual and commercial freedom is important in the  financing  model  of
the audiovisual industry.


The main concern we have is that  the  country  of  origin  principle  could
seriously undermine our capacity to enforce our rights. In  Football  Dataco
v Sportradar, the capacity of a rights holder to bring  proceedings  against
an infringement is provided for both in the  country  where  the  server  is
located and the country where the act of communication to the  public  takes
place. This targeted approach is necessary as the location of a  server  can
often be elusive or located in a country outside the EU with low  levels  of
copyright  protection  (AG  Opinion.  2013.  UPC  Telekabel  Wien  GmbH   v.
Constantin Film Verleih GmbH and Wega Filmproduktionsgesellschaft  GmbH  (C-
314/12). By allowing the rights holder to take action where the  public  are
targeted, the ability to enforce copyright  is  more  effective.  Under  the
country of origin principle the jurisdiction is in  the  country  where  the
server is based. As a consequence intermediaries would locate their  servers
in countries where there are  the  least  protections  for  rights  holders;
there would be a race to the bottom. For rights holders it would  be  almost
impossible to protect their works from unauthorised use.


The country of origin principle would therefore undermine Article  17(2)  of
the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Under  this  Article  the
European union institutions are required to  protect  intellectual  property
rights. Whilst this  is  not  an  absolute  right,  the  country  of  origin
principle could lead to a complete disintegration of  copyright  protection.
This of course has repercussions for the industry  as  it  will  worsen  the
unlevel playing field which already exists due to  piracy  discouraging  the
development of new innovative services and content.


In  our  opinion  the  current  scope  of  the  making  available  right  is
sufficient.  Furthermore,  the  CJEU  is  best  placed  to   interpret   any
ambiguities and provide clarity. Any  limitation  to  the  making  available
right should respect the Three-Step Test.





€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


X YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


Any attempt to undermine the current scope of  the  making  available  right
should  be  avoided.  In  particular,  extending  the  Cable  and  Satellite
Directive’s country of origin principle  to  online  would  be  particularly
damaging to an  important  right  which  is  protected  by  the  Charter  of
Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union  and  enshrined  in  the  WIPO
Copyright Treaty. This would limit the scope  for  licensing  and  enforcing
the making available right which is an important tool in the development  of
the digital world.


In the audiovisual sector all the necessary rights  are  generally  held  by
the producer. The freedom to manage audiovisual content  both  territorially
and chronologically is crucial. Contractual and  commercial  freedom  allows
the rights holder to exploit their work in the most optimal way  and  is  an
important mechanism in the audiovisual industries financing model.


The broad scope of the making available right  is  also  important  for  the
protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. The  country  of
origin approach could make it much more difficult for right holders to  take
legal action against infringing websites, which are usually based  in  other
Member States or even outside the EU.


Furthermore, the country of origin principle could lead to  a  race  to  the
bottom . If the location  of  the  server  is  the  place  of  jurisdiction,
copyright infringing sites would simply move their servers  outside  of  the
EU  to  the  country  with  the  least  remuneration  to   rights   holders.
Furthermore, the Commission would have  to  guarantee  a  similar  level  of
rights protection in all the Member States which at present does not  exist.



The judgement raises questions about measures which would limit  this  scope
of the making available right. We would like to highlight  the  Commission’s
role in upholding the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms.  The
institutions are required to protect  intellectual  property  under  Article
17(2). Any derogation from this  would  undermine  the  charter.  Whilst  we
recognise that this  is  not  an  absolute  right,  the  country  of  origin
principle would cause significant damage to this right. Limiting  the  scope
of the right could lead to the complete collapse of copyright protection.


For both licensing and enforcement reasons it is important to  maintain  the
current scope of the making available  right.  Ensuring  adequate  financing
and a level playing field in the  distribution  of  audiovisual  content  is
vital to the development of the digital single market as it  will  encourage
innovative new services  and  the  production  of  diverse  and  imaginative
content to serve consumer needs. Furthermore, limiting such  a  right  would
undermine European jurisprudence and EU law. In  our  opinion  the  CJEU  is
best placed to interpret EU law and provide clarity. This  is  evident  from
its recent rulings which are referenced in this document. Any limitation  to
the making available right must respect the Three-Step Test  as  established
in international copyright treaties.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO


The application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment does not create any problems for CEPI or its
members. Unlike the music industry where rights can often be fragmented
amongst multiple rights holders, in the audiovisual sector all the
necessary rights are usually held by the producer. Normally, other
contributors to audiovisual creations contractually give their rights to
the producer(s). This means that both making available and reproduction
rights are exclusively the producer’s in the large majority of cases. With
regard of the problems that exist in this respect for the music industry,
the recently established Collective Rights Management Directive is
perfectly capable of handling. 


CEPI would like to make clear that the reproduction right and the right to
making available are two separate rights embedded in the copyright
framework that already provides for clear rights for rightholders. This
means these two rights are not to be considered a single act of economic
exploitation.


With regard to the online environment, reproduction rights relate to the
uploading of copies of any audiovisual subject-matter to a platform’s
server or to a consumer’s device. The separate forms of reproduction by the
consumer and end user should not be confused and thought of as falling into
a single act of economic exploitation.


Legislative change that creates a unitary right for reproduction and making
available could seriously limit the scope of these rights. We reckon that
this would only serve to undermine the freedom of producers to license
their works in a flexible and optimal way. In fact, restricting the
protection of the exclusive rights of rightholders would be in direct
violation of the EU Charter and relevant international treaties. Article 10
of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, Article 13 of the TRIPs Agreement and Article
9 of the Berne Convention prohibit removing a right which provides an
important protection for exclusive rights unless within the confines of the
three-step test.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


The provision of a hyperlink leading  to  a  work  or  other  subject-matter
protected under copyright should be subject  to  the  authorization  of  the
rightholder in general.


Article 3 of the Directive 2001/29/EC (the Directive) on  the  harmonization
of certain aspects of  copyright  and  related  rights  in  the  information
society has sufficiently and clearly laid out rightholders’ exclusive  right
to authorise or prohibit  any  communication  to  the  public,  by  wire  or
wireless means, including the making available to the public of their  works
in such a way that members of the public may access them from  a  place  and
at a time individually chosen by them.


More specifically, according to the Directive Member  States  shall  provide
for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  available  to
the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way  that  members  of  the
public may access them from a place and at a  time  individually  chosen  by
them: (i) for performers, of  fixations  of  their  performances,  (ii)  for
phonogram producers, of their phonograms, (iii) for  the  producers  of  the
first fixations of films, of the original and copies of  their  films,  (iv)
for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of  their  broadcasts,  whether
these broadcasts are transmitted by wire  or  over  the  air,  including  by
cable or satellite.


Article 4 on the  Distribution  right,  moreover,  establishes  that  Member
States shall provide for authors, in respect of the original of their  works
or of copies thereof, the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any  form
of distribution to the public by sale or otherwise. This distribution  right
shall not be exhausted within the Community in respect of  the  original  or
copies of the work, except  where  the  first  sale  or  other  transfer  of
ownership in the Community of that object is  made  by  the  rightholder  or
with his consent.


In  the  case  of  (hyper-)linking  to  a  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright, by any individual, there is indeed an  act  of  making  available
and/or communication to the public such a work.  Therefore,  (hyper-)linking
to copyrighted subject-matter without it being authorized in any way by  the
rightholder constitutes an infringement of copyright.


Next to the provisions laid out in the Directive, the  CJEU’s  jurisprudence
provides clarity in cases of (hyper-)linking. CEPI regards the decisions  of
the CJEU as  well-informed  and  having  already  established  some  of  the
parameters  with  regard  to  linking  to  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright.  With  the  imminent  decisions  in  the  Svensson  ,   BestWater
International   and  C  More  Entertainment  cases,   we   believe   further
elaboration will be provided. We therefore see  no  need  for  a  change  in
legislation.





CEPI stresses that  it  is  aware  that  hyperlinking  is  an  integral  and
essential part of the  workings  of  the  online  environment  and  strongly
endorses the use of internet as a medium to support creativity and  cultural
diversity. However, in order  to  protect  Europe’s  creative  and  cultural
industries and support the aforementioned cultural diversity of Europe,  the
right to authorize or prohibit any communication to the public  -  including
the making available of owned works – should remain solely  and  exclusively
with the rightholder. This necessitates the authorization of  any  provision
of a hyperlink leading to a work or  other  subject-matter  protected  under
copyright, in general, by the rightholder.


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


The viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary  reproduction  of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the  screen  and
in the cache memory of the user’s computer should, in  general,  be  subject
to the authorization of the rightholder.


As with regard  to  (hyper-)linking,  it  is  the  exclusive  right  of  the
rightholder to commission any reproduction, however  temporary  its  nature,
of the works he or she owns. Article 5  of  the  Directive  2001/29/EC  (the
Directive) on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and  related
rights in the information society distinguishes ‘caching’ as  a  ‘transient’
reproduction of a work that enables  web-browsing.  We  agree  that  at  the
moment it is an inherent feature of using the internet. With this  in  mind,
we believe that the Directive sufficiently provides for the  possibility  of
authorizing caching.


Keeping an eye on the quick  technological  developments  of  the  worldwide
web,  supplements  in  jurisprudence  by  the  CJEU  provide   for   further
clarification of temporary reproductions of subject-matter  protected  under
copyright. A pragmatic interpretation, as for example given in  the  opinion
by Advocate General Trstenjak , could be useful:


“In fact the condition of lawful use of a  work  cannot  be  interpreted  as
meaning  that  the  temporary  acts  of  reproduction  must  constitute   in
themselves a lawful use of the work; that condition must on the contrary  be
understood as meaning that the temporary acts of  reproduction  must  enable
another use of the work which must itself be lawful. To take an example:  if
an  education  establishment  makes  a  copy  during  a   course   and   for
illustration purposes – that is, a reproduction – of a given work,  such  as
a video recording of an  educational  programme,  and  during  that  act  of
reproduction a copy of the video recording is temporarily registered in  the
RAM memory of the computer, that temporary copy which is created in the  RAM
memory enables a reproduction for illustration purposes  during  the  course
which is lawful pursuant  to  Article  5(3)(a)  of  Directive  2001/29.  The
temporary copy which is created in the RAM memory is however lawful only  if
all of the other  conditions  of  Article  5(1)  of  Directive  2001/29  are
fulfilled, that is, if it is transient or incidental, if it is  an  integral
and essential part of a technological process and if it has  no  independent
economic significance. If the condition of lawful use  of  Article  5(1)  of
Directive 2001/29 were to be interpreted as meaning that the  temporary  act
of reproduction had to be a lawful  use,  that  would  mean  that,  for  the
purposes of the lawfulness of that temporary act of reproduction, the  other
conditions of that article would no longer need to be fulfilled and  Article
5(1) of Directive 2001/29 would be devoid of purpose.”


Of course, this only relates to the  lawful  temporary  reproduction  of  an
copyrighted work. CEPI  likes  to  emphasize  that  rightholders  should  be
protected in order to ensure their intellectual  property,  as  well  as  to
stimulate creativity and cultural diversity. If temporary reproduction of  a
work leads  to  pirating  or  any  other  form  of  copyright  infringement,
adequate action should be undertaken  to  stop  this  infringement,  and  to
compensate the rightholder for his or her damages.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


X NO


We would like to underline the important difference between the
“registration of identity” and “registration of rights”. The audiovisual
sector has already made considerable progress in developing online
infrastructures to facilitate the former of these: the identification of
copyrighted works. For example, existing identifiers such as the
International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN, www.isan.org) and the
Entertainment Identifier Registry (EIDR, www.eidr.org) illustrate the
sector’s constructive efforts to improve public access to information
concerning right holders and to facilitate the identification of works in
the digital environment.


We do not however support the idea of an EU-level registration of rights.
Producers play an important role as tthe ‘one-stop-shop’ for rights, and we
therefore believe it is important for producers to retain the contractual
freedom to manage their rights, and in instances where this is not
possible, licensing agreements may be negotiated by CMOs.


While we support the European Commission’s aim of facilitating the
identification of audiovisual works, any such system of registration and/or
identification must remain voluntary in order to respect international
norms and cultural diversity..





€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Any identification system of audiovisual works must provide a cost-
effective and flexible framework which ensures a high level of security. We
believe that it is important to allow the market to continue to develop
voluntary and practicable solutions to facilitate the identification of
audiovisual works. As mentioned above, it is also important to distinguish
between the identification of works and the registration of rights – while
we are in favour of the former, the latter would be a disproportionate
system that would undermine producers’ contractual freedom to negotiate
licensing agreements.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Any such system would need sufficient levels of security to prevent  misuse,
and the misappropriation of rights.


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


As the representative organisation of audiovisual right holders, CEPI
supports the facilitation of identifying audiovisual works, but believes
that the internationally recognised ISAN and EIDR already provide an
accessible means of identification of audiovisual works.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


The topic of identifiers was a key point of discussion during the Licences
for Europe process, in which CEPI played an active role. CEPI is signatory
to a joint declaration on audiovisual works identifiers that was adopted by
several organisations and associations during the Licences for Europe
process . The declaration:


- Recognises the importance of internationally-recognised and interoperable
identifiers (such as ISAN and EIDR) to increase the availability of
audiovisual content online;


- Encourages stakeholders at the national and European level to consider
the implementation of measures to facilitate wider use of such identifiers;



- Suggests assessing the possibility using an internationally-recognised
standard identifier for all audiovisual and cinematographic works
benefitting from Media/Creative Europe programme funding;


- Recommends the full implementation of interoperability between ISAN and
EIDR, and calls for greater interoperability rights registries where these
identifiers are used.


We do not believe there is a need for the EU to intervene further in this
area, other than the promotion of the use of identifiers as set out in the
declaration.





Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X YES – Please explain


Producers often provide financial investment ahead of a certain project  and
consequently assume significant financial risk, with no certainty  that  the
project will be successful or not.  This investment is the  same  regardless
of whether the content is destined for the online or  offline  environments.
Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the success of a  project  and  even
in cases of success it may take several years for producers to recoup  their
investments. As a result, any modification of the term of  protection  would
provide a disincentive for producers to invest in  new  content,  and  would
come into conflict with the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights (Art.17)  which
guarantees the right to private property, including  intellectual  property.
We therefore believe that the current terms of  protection  are  appropriate
for both the online and offline environments.


The extension of the term of protection for music performers  and  producers
(Directive 2011/77/EU) was not  applied  to  producers  in  the  audiovisual
sector; such an extension was not even considered by the Commission  at  the
time due to the different cultural and commercial features of the music  and
audiovisual sectors. This is still  the  case,  and  we  would  consequently
argue in favour of maintaining the status quo.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


The  2001  Copyright  Directive  sets  out  a  number  of   exceptions   and
limitations which the EU Member States may decide to implement at their  own
discretion, in line with the principle  of  subsidiarity.  This  flexibility
was intended to cope with rapid  technological  change  and  to  provide  an
appropriate level harmonisation between Member States.


We would argue that the optional nature of limitations and  exceptions  does
not lead to practical problems. The application of the  three-step  test  as
well as a growing body of EU case law both  provide  satisfactory  means  of
ensuring that exceptions are uniformly interpreted and that a  fair  balance
between consumers and right holders is achieved.





€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


Making exceptions mandatory would oblige many Member States to change  their
current legal frameworks and would be a disproportionate  step,  considering
the cultural diversity of the EU and the legal burden that would  be  placed
on Member States in order  to  implement  mandatory  exceptions.  There  are
current  mechanisms  in  place  that  provide  an   appropriate   level   of
flexibility: the three-step test and many examples of EU case law.


Finally it is important to point out that maintaining the status quo is  not
to stifle creativity; the European creative industries are flourishing.


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]

As we have  mentioned  in  the  previous  question,  the  European  creative
industries are flourishing and the  current  framework  of  limitations  and
exceptions is flexible enough to allow creators to  develop  new  works.  In
cases  where  problems  have  been  identified  by  the  market,   practical
solutions have been established, such as the Orphan Works Directive and  the
Collective Rights Management Directive. There is therefore  little  evidence
that any exceptions or limitations should be added to or  removed  from  the
existing catalogue. Were any new exception or limitation to  be  introduced,
there would need to be a sound and legal justification.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain why


CEPI  believes  the  current  regulatory  framework  for   limitations   and
exceptions provides an appropriate  balance  between  respect  for  cultural
diversity and national legal traditions while allowing the creative  sectors
to flourish. The  foundations  built  on  European  case  law  and  existing
legislation (the Copyright  Directive  and  the  e-Commerce  Directive,  for
example), provide an appropriate degree of flexibility.





€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

As noted above, CEPI believes the current framework provides an  appropriate
degree of flexibility and allows the  Member  States’  legal  frameworks  to
develop according to their legal  traditions.  Furthermore,  the  three-step
test is an adequate tool to ensure a  fair  balance  between  consumers  and
right holders and a consistent interpretation of the  law.  The  ‘fair  use’
principle however is assessed on a case-by-case basis, which would  lead  to
a lack of legal uncertainty. We feel this would be  a  negative  development
for the EU framework.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


Given the importance of territoriality of copyright, it is logical that  the
framework for limitations and exceptions within the EU is  also  territorial
in nature; we do not believe that this constitutes a problem. In  accordance
with subsidiarity national laws will be used to assess whether a  limitation
or exception is relevant to a certain act  of  exploitation  in  the  Member
State where protection is requested.


€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

In such cases, compensation would be addressed in the country where the  use
occurs, in accordance with international norms and EU law.






Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

X NO





CEPI  shares  the  view  that  European   cinematographic   heritage   works
constitute unique cultural elements  as  well  as  valuable  assets  in  the
European digital economy. We strongly value  the  importance  of  preserving
the content for both historical and  cultural  purposes.  It  is  felt  that
there are multiple benefits of the  archiving  of  cinematographic  heritage
works to the public, heritage institutions, and rightsholders, but  this  is
acknowledged while emphasising that any work done in  this  area  under  the
preservation exception should  be  carried  out  without  contradicting  the
interests of rightsholders who produce those works so integral  to  European
culture. With regards to this careful  balance,  in  our  experience,  three
legal issues may hinder the re-use of audiovisual works.

In  CEPI’s  view,  preservation  and  access  to  European   cinematographic
heritage  works  can  be  achieved  only  through  a   close   collaborative
relationship between rightsholders,  European  film  heritage  institutions,
and other relevant parties when and where applicable. It is  felt  that  any
problems  encountered  in  the  use  of  the  preservation   exception   are
adequately  dealt  with  through  close  co-operation  between  the  parties
involved, or at least to the extent that legislation is unneeded.

For our producers it is then the determination of  the  IP  ownership  of  a
work which is crucial to make sure that the copy will  not  be  commercially
viable elsewhere and/or and made available to the  public  contravening  the
rights of rights holders of setting this  exception  only  for  preservation
purposes .


Furthermore, it also very important for the libraries and/or the archive  to
establish  security  system  which  are  adequate  enough  to  avoid  piracy
occurring.

Last but not least, we would like to draw attention to  the  excellent  work
achieved  in  Working  Group  3  of  the  Licenses  for  Europe  stakeholder
dialogue, in which the audiovisual rights holders and the  archives  pledged
to co-operate closely in order to facilitate the digitisation of and  access
to European cinematographic  heritage  works.  This  pledge  exists  as  the
perfect example of the kind of close co-operation  that  CEPI  advocates  to
the  problems  detailed  above  raised  by  the  EU   Commission   in   this
consultation  as  well  as  during  almost  a   year   dialogue   with   the
stakeholders, through the Licensing for Europe process.  Although  CEPI  was
not a co-signatory, we valued the importance  of  this  initiative  and  the
instrument achieved as result of it[44].

We believe that a solution drawing upon a  close  and  direct  collaborative

the  best  solution  to  any  problems  encountered  in  the  use  of   the

used similar contracts with archives and can be used again  in  the  future
with the possible assistance of stakeholder dialogues. For  further  detail
please refer to our answer to question 29 of this consultation.


Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

In the UK, we are aware that there are already licensing arrangements in
Place through the Educational Recording Agency, ERC which allows the use of
copyright material for educational purposes

If you can provide any examples of agreements negotiated with institutional
users such as national libraries or universities, please provide this
information here, otherwise we will not answer this question.


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Firstly we believe that before providing such a remote access cross
borders, even for purposes of research and private study, a detailed
assessment as to whether this could affect a significant direct impact on
the licensing agreement already in place, should be taken into
consideration. This indeed should not have any effect on the creator’s
income and such licensing agreements should take place only if addressing a
legitimate public interest aim.

Secondly, careful attention should be addressed to the potential for such
remote access for users to contribute to piracy. Outside of the controlled
environments and networks of library reading rooms and university computer
clusters, it is more difficult to control the use of collections accessed
by users, and the danger of unauthorised and high-quality copies of
audiovisual material being made is high. Whether the cost of these extra
security systems would be borne by the consumer is another question that
CEPI poses, keeping in mind that the consumer could be mislead thinking
that once he pays, he can have complete access to the material (exceeding
the rights to use the AV content for educational purposes).

A further problem encountered in this area concerns the ownership of the
digital copy of a work from a collection, and this is one area that often
needs clarification in agreements reached between producers and archive
institutions. In this area we feel it should be clear who has ownership of
the digital copy of a work if both archive and producer have digitised it.

In this area we largely welcome and appreciate the framework of guidelines
that were set up in this area as part of the discussion in Working Group 3
of the recent Licenses for Europe stakeholder dialogue. However, due to the
nature of our organisation we approach this issue from two angles due to
our representation of both film and TV producers.

  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]
CEPI does not feel that a legislative solution would be the  best  means  to
tackle any problems in this area, and would  refer  you  to  our  answer  to
question 28 of this consultation.

  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

We believe that a solution drawing upon a close  collaborative  relationship
between  rightsholders,  European  film  heritage  institutes,   and   other
relevant parties when and where applicable (on a  voluntary  basis)  is  the
best solution to any problems encountered in off premises access to  library
collections. In the past rights holders have  used  similar  contracts  with
archives and can be used again in the future with  the  possible  assistance
of stakeholder dialogues. We would refer you to our answer  to  question  33
of this consultation for further detail.








E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

[Open question]

We strongly support European cultural diversity and its distribution to  the
public, inter alia through public institutions like libraries. However,  the
audiovisual industry has already faced unfair  competition  from  libraries;
if it is able to get a product for free, nobody will want  to  pay  for  it.
The physical works (ie DVDs) that are available  in  libraries  have  always
been part of the licensing systems that  exist  for  copyrighted  work  with
regard to libraries. These licensing systems, on their part, are  an  aspect
of the necessary windows that are used by  audiovisual  creators.  In  other
words, libraries get their copies of the material  later  than  cinemas  and
retailers.

This  has  been  clearly  established  in  Directive   2001/29/EC   on   the
harmonization of certain aspects of copyright  and  related  rights  in  the
information society:

“Member States may provide for an exception or limitation  for  the  benefit
of certain non-profit making establishments,  such  as  publicly  accessible
libraries and equivalent institutions, as well as  archives.  However,  this
should be limited to certain  special  cases  covered  by  the  reproduction
right. Such an exception or limitation should not cover  uses  made  in  the
context of on-line delivery of protected works or other subject-matter”.

Article 2, on exceptions and limitations, states that:

“Member  States  may  provide  for  exceptions   or   limitations   to   the
reproduction right provided for in Article 2 in the following cases: (c)  in
respect of  specific  acts  of  reproduction  made  by  publicly  accessible
libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives, which  are
not for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage”.

As stated earlier, every film is  a  prototype.  Film  producers  invest  in
projects that have no guarantee  whatsoever  in  giving  a  return  on  this
investment. A change in the  library  exception  –  where  the  reproduction
right is circumvented – would mean that libraries get an economic  advantage
over other outlets for audiovisual content that are  part  of  the  business
model of the producers of creative works.

This will undeniably undermine the work of the creative industry;  in  fact,
it will undermine cultural diversity in Europe as a  whole.  CEPI  therefore
pleads for no new exceptions and limitations for libraries when it comes  to
e-lending.

But this is not the only difference between libraries’  original  activities
and off-premises consultation and e-lending.

We have some serious concerns about the higher chances and possibilities  of
people using the  off-premises  material  provided  by  their  libraries  to
infringe on the copyright of rightholders.

Rightholders, such as producers in the audiovisual sector, should always  be
ensured  that  their  copyrights  are  respected,  especially  when   modern
technology entails an increased risk of pirating behaviour. If  we  want  to
sustain the creativity and  cultural  diversity  that  characterize  all  28
member states, and make sure  that  all  citizens  can  benefit  from  them,
rightholders should be protected, also when it comes to libraries.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[45].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[46].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

The 2011 MoU refers only to print works; this question therefore is not
applicable to the audiovisual sector.





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

Although the question of mass digitisation is an important one to consider,
the 2011 MoU for print works would not be an appropriate solution for the
audiovisual sector. CEPI played an active role in the discussion of mass
digitisation during the Licenses for Europe process (WG3), and at the final
plenary meeting in November, presented a paper which stated:


- Licensing agreements for the use of broadcasters’ archives must be
voluntary and consistent with EU law, particularly the 2012/28/EU Orphan
Works’ Directive;


- The diligent search for right holders must be adapted to the
collaborative nature of audiovisual works;


- The importance of ensuring adequate remuneration to right holders is an
essential guide for future dialogue;


- Contractual freedom is crucial in addressing rights clearance, which
shall be exercised without prejudice to national arrangements. Where and
when appropriate, extended collective licensing may also provide a viable
solution;


- The type of use and of content covered shall be clarified at the national
level in the licensing agreements and shall not interfere with the normal
commercial exploitation of audiovisual works;


- Any non-commercial mass release of archive programming must be sensitive
to the impact it will have on the overall market in each territory;


- Publicly accessible audiovisual heritage institutions such as national
libraries may consider that works held in their archives present some
similarities with those held in the archives of broadcasters and may
therefore find it useful to refer also to the above points.


CEPI also highlighted its willingness to continue the dialogue begun during
the TV Subgroup of Working Group 3.

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[49]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [50].

The Marrakesh Treaty[51] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you

CEPI supports practical solutions taht allow disabled  users  to  access  to
audiovisual content. The Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC  contains  a  number
of provisions that facilitate access, such as Article 5(3)b  which  provides
a  flexible  approach  to  access.  We  believe  individual   and   flexible
contractual solutions are  the  most  appropriate  means  of  improving  the
accessibility of audiovisual content for users with disabilities.





Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[52] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[53].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[54]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[55].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[56]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[57][58].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[59]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


Private copying levies were introduced to address perceived market  failures
which  prevented  right  holders  from  managing  directly  the   right   of
reproduction.  They  find  justification  for  their   existence   in   both
international and European law: the Berne  Convention  (Article  9(2));  and
the 2001 European Union Copyright Directive, Article 5(2)(b): Member  States
may provide for exceptions or limitations  to  the  reproduction  right...in
respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for  private
use and for ends that are neither directly  nor  indirectly  commercial,  on
condition that the rightholders receive  fair  compensation.  This  is  also
reflected in case law from the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union
(CJEU), such as the 2010  Padawan  v  SGAE  case,  which  found  that:  that
equipment or devices are able to make copies  is  sufficient  in  itself  to
justify the application of the private copying levy.


The exception is laid out clearly by Article 5(2)(b), excluding copies  made
by or for a third party as are copies made from illegal sources. It is  also
clear that strict adherence to the three-step test set out  in  Article  5.5
of the Copyright Directive is necessary, and that appropriate  technological
protection measures (Copyright Directive, Article 6) must be made  available
under national law.  This includes protection for access and copy  controls,
prohibition of acts of circumvention and preparatory acts  of  circumvention
accompanied by effective sanctions.


The introduction of a private copying levy system  is  optional  for  Member
States; there are  therefore  widely  different  applications  of  the  levy
across the EU. In former Commissioner Vitorino’s report on  private  copying
levies,  published  in  January  2013,   Vitorino   argues   that   although
‘divergent’  levy  systems  within  the  EU  can   create   distortions   of
competition and barriers to the single market, he concedes  that  there  are
good reasons  for  these  differences,  linked  as  they  are  to  the  “the
different traditions  and  values  underpinning  the  cultural  policies  of
member states.” Not least among these is the fact that some countries,  such
as France, use a significant  proportion  of  the  money  generated  by  the
private copying levy to invest in the cultural and creative  industries.  He
also acknowledges  that  harmonisation  across  the  EU  “could  lead  to  a
situation where harmonised tariffs more or less reflect  the  highest  level
of national tariffs  in  place  today.”  We  support  Vitorino’s  subsequent
conclusion that “whether a product is  subject  to  a  levy  or  not  should
therefore be left to member states”.





Where it is  possible,  there  are  also  developing  opportunities  in  the
digital environment for direct  licensing  of  works,  through  for  example
digital content management solutions. Such services allow right  holders  to
license directly their works and consequently to take into  account  in  the
cost of the license the authorisation of a number of copies to be  made  for
private use (for use on different devices, for example) rather than  relying
on the private copying levy.


Such direct licensing systems are evolving  naturally  through  the  market,
but do not reduce the important role private  copying  levies  play  in  the
analogue world. Provided that safeguards exist  to  protect  consumers  from
duplicating payments, and to ensure that right  holders  receive  sufficient
remuneration, we believe it is possible for both private copying levies  and
direct licensing schemes to co-exist.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[60]

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


Digital copies that have been licensed by right holders are not  subject  to
private copying levies; this has been clarified by  the  European  Court  of
Justice. In such cases, where the making of copies has  already  been  taken
into account in the license  agreement,  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
apply levies.


Levies will remain relevant however in cases where copies  can  be  made  of
content that is contained in digital terrestrial broadcasts.


It is also important to underline that the principle of the  application  of
private copying levies lies in the possibility of harm to the right  holder;
the application private copying levy is justified without the need to  prove
that the act of copying has taken place.





€ NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


In cases where legal copies in cloud-based services are licensed,  attention
must be paid to avoid consumers paying twice  for  copies,  something  which
Vitorino warns against. In addition, allowing right holders the  possibility
of directly exploiting their rights has advantages for  both  right  holders
and consumers, who will benefit from a wider choice of services  and  costs.
Direct  licensing  agreements  are  developing  naturally  as  new   digital
opportunities and technologies emerge.


Nonetheless  levies  remain  relevant  in  the  digital  age,  as  has  been
illustrated by the recent Hewlett Packard GmbH v Austro-Mechana case,  which
confirmed that fair  compensation  must  be  paid  for  private  copying  of
copyrighted works to multifunctional storage devices such  as  hard  drives,
tablets or PCs.


It is also important to  note  that  in  certain  Member  States  the  money
generated from the private copying  levy  is  used  for  investment  in  the
cultural and creative industries, which is of great benefit to  the  public.
It is important that Member States must be allowed to continue  to  dedicate
money to the development of the cultural industries.




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[61]

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


We would suggest that introducing an obligation for levies to be visible  on
invoices is not desirable for several reasons. Firstly,  if  one  such  levy
must be made visible, it follows that all levies applied to the  cost  of  a
product should be made visible in the interests  of  transparency.  Although
transparency is preferable, any new obligation must take  into  account  the
cost-effectiveness of the proposition and should avoid placing  unreasonable
burdens on the market – the application of such requirements may  ultimately
result in additional costs being passed on to retailers and/or consumers.


Finally, displaying the levy could lead some consumers to  think  that  they
have paid for the “right” to use the equipment for making  copies  from  any
source. As we have already underlined, it is essential to  ensure  that  the
private copying levy is in no way a means to offset the cost of piracy,  but
applies only to copies for private use of legally obtained content.





€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[62].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[63] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[64]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]
The remuneration of authors and performers  is  an  important  concern,  and
there  are  certainly  issues  that  should  be  addressed   regarding   how
remuneration models may operate under a new audiovisual value chain.

Independent producers strongly encourage the legal and commercial  certainty
of contracts. This is crucial not only to foster fruitful  discussions  with
authors/performers but it is also a fundamental means to  ensure  a  healthy
environment for the sector to  develop  under  satisfactory  conditions  for
both sides.

We would like to recall that in the business model  for  film/TV  programmes
the role of the producer is especially important as producers often  provide
the  investment  ahead  of  a  certain  project  and   consequently   assume
significant financial risk, with no  certainty  that  this  latter  will  be
successful or not. The existing legal and contractual framework  allows  for
upfront remuneration of authors and performers  (unlike  the  producer)  and
allows  them  to  receive  further  income  from   secondary   or   tertiary
exploitation. In this  way  the  licensing  process  remains  efficient  and
streamlined; something which should be carefully  considered  before  making
any changes to the status quo.

The audiovisual industry clearly demonstrates complex ownership  models  but
to evoke a statutory remuneration right on  the  basis  of  the  film  gross
income from a distribution sale to a single  release  would  undermine  both
the producer’s willingness to invest in  future  projects  as  well  as  the
private investors’ willingness  to  support  or  sponsor  other  audiovisual
works. We anticipate that this would reduce investment and thus  the  volume
of niche-productions, which ultimately would reduce consumer choice.

Furthermore, a statutory  remuneration  right  for  authors  and  performers
would be a direct intervention not only into domestic  contractual  practice
for producers of AV content but also into domestic wage determination  which
would not  achieve  any  consensus  amongst  the  different  Member  States.
Domestic  Contractual  Practice  should  be  carefully  kept  in  mind  when
thinking about “fair remuneration”. Statutory regulation  would  only  serve
to reduce the flexibility that producers have in  negotiating  and  agreeing
remuneration arrangements with authors and performers.

We would  also  argue  that  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  right  to
remuneration  subject   to   mandatory   collective   licensing   would   be
disproportionate. This would  see  CMOs  seek  payment  from  the  platforms
licensing audiovisual content regardless of pre-existing agreements  between
producers and authors or performers, resulting in  users  paying  twice  for
the  same  content.  No  right  holder  should  be  forced  into  collective
management or collective licensing except in cases  where  exclusive  rights
are subject to mandatory collective administration for  practicable  reasons
under international law; such cases are however the  exception  rather  than
the rule.

Any future policy developments must  be  evidence-based  solutions  to  real
problems, and must be carefully considered in order to avoid disrupted long-
standing national-level remuneration mechanisms.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain why


The experiences of CEPI members can vary on this topic, and whilst  we  have
countries where collective contracts have  the  character  of  law  and  the
minimum wage table for film makers are therefore obligatory and  contain  an
adequate remuneration for authors, on the contrary, we have countries  which
have  tried  to  regulate  and  ensure  adequacy  of  remuneration  for  the
exploitation of online works underlining a situation which does  not  always
and necessarily help the author. Indeed, consequences  can  rather  be  that
the existing minimum wage tables and existing payment are reduced as far  as
obligatory shares are introduced.


Furthermore, it cannot be underemphasised  that  the  producer  has  to  set
aside reserves and if the remuneration is a collective  remuneration,  which
is directly collected by the online platform (irrespective of  the  concrete
exploitation turnover), this can also downgrade the  already  weak  economic
situation of the legal platforms, the economical base of  which  is  already
quite  disadvantaged  by  the  attractive  illegal  offers  and  the  scarce
copyright enforcements currently in place.


In this sense we would encourage the Commission to take these  factors  into
major consideration for future proposals which  can  address  online  rights
management/remuneration.


There is a further consideration in that the license or transfer  of  rights
from TV  producers  to  a  broadcaster  does  not  follow  a  consistent  or
predictable formula but depends greatly on the financial and  funding  model
of any given production.  Financial models of  online  platforms  also  vary
widely, making it very difficult to adopt a one size fits  all  approach  to
this issue.  We  consider  it  appropriate  for  further  investigation  and
analysis to be carried out and impact assessments undertaken in  respect  of
any contemplated models.

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[65] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[66].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[67]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[68].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

XYES – Please explain


CEPI thinks that the civil enforcement system in the EU should  be  rendered
more efficient for infringements of copyright committed  with  a  commercial
purpose. We emphasise the importance  of  a  strong  enforcement  system  to
protect the cultural and creative industries of the  EU.  Piracy  and  other
forms of copyright infringement have been demonstrated to endanger  cultural
development, as well as jobs and growth. Moreover, financial losses  related
to  massive  copyright  infringements  have  a  big   negative   impact   on
investments, since they lead to a reduced appetite for risk  in  the  entire
media industry. This constrains the budgets of a billions-of-Euros  industry
and makes doing projects difficult or even impossible. This,  in  its  turn,
hampers sustaining and developing cultural diversity in the continent.


The  Commission’s  efforts  to  improve  the  current  legal  framework   on
intellectual property rights to strengthen the civil enforcement system  for
infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial  purpose  are  much
appreciated and welcomed by  CEPI  and  its  members.  We  think  it  is  of
paramount importance that the Commission  promotes  a  European  audiovisual
production industry that is sustainable and allows for  innovative  services
and products to foster growth and jobs in the EU.


We  also  believe  that  the  current  digital  age  creates   unprecedented
opportunities for  intellectual  property  owners  and  other  stakeholders,
including consumers. Nonetheless, the Comission should be attentive  to  the
easy channels that are established through the internet for the illegal  use
of copyright protected subject-matter which undermines the potential of  the
industry. A study from 2010 has  shown  that  the  core  copyright-intensive
industries  generate  7  million  jobs,  contribute  approximately  EUR  509
billion and  generate  a  trade  surplus,  while  predicted  losses  due  to
copyright infringement piracy may reach as much as 1.2 million jobs by  2015
in the EU.[1] In order to support  cultural  diversity  and  innovation,  as
well as to create  jobs  and  economic  growth,  proper  enforcement  is  an
indispensable condition.


The creation of more legal alternatives for the distribution of  copyrighted
material  is  often  mentioned  as  a  tool  against  the  infringements  of
rightholders. We believe this is just one of the  solutions  and  one  which
can only flourish if there is a digital environment which respects the  rule
of law and where piracy is combated. Respect  is  essential  in  making  the
legal offers of audiovisual content to thrive online, as well as to give  an
incentive to create new, innovative digital  content  services.  Piracy  has
drastic impacts on the revenues of film and TV producers. This has a domino-
effect on investments needed for physical and online  distribution  as  well
as audiovisual creation. Intellectual property rights  are  by  no  means  a
barrier to access content. Conversely, intellectual property  rights  ensure
the creation of cultural content and enable viable business models  for  the
cultural and creative industries.


Evidence shows that the wide offer of legal content is not the  only  answer
to copyright infringement. The Council of Europe’s  Audiovisual  Observatory
has revealed in a recent market survey that over  700  legitimate  on-demand
audiovisual services were available in Europe in 2009  and  there  are  also
over 250 legal music services  available  in  Europe.[2]  Nonetheless,  high
levels of digital piracy continue to cannibalise legal offerings and  thwart
the development of a legitimate online marketplace for creative works,  even
in countries that know the highest  number  of  legal  online  services  for
audiovisual content. This  means  that,  even  if  additional  legal  offers
should continue to be encouraged, online piracy  needs  to  be  combated  in
itself.


In order to create a real Single Market in the European Union,  restrictions
on freedom of movement and anti-competitive practices must be eliminated  or
reduced as much as possible, while creating  an  environment  favourable  to
innovation  and  investment.  Therefore,  protecting  intellectual  property
rights is an essential element and of paramount importance  if  we  want  to
have a successful Single Market. In our growing  knowledge-based  economies,
the protection of intellectual property is important not only for  promoting
innovation, creativity and  cultural  diversity,  but  also  for  developing
employment and improving competitiveness.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

CEPI feels that while the current legal framework is largely  beneficial  to
effective  protection  of  copyright,  there  are  certain  areas  in  which
measures could be taken to improve certain  aspects,  particularly  relating
to the involvement  of  intermediaries.  The  role  of  ‘intermediaries’  is
crucial in preventative measures  against  IPR  infringement.  Although  the
current Enforcement Directive  does  put  tools  in  place  to  address  IPR
infringement, these measures do not  achieve  the  desired  results  because
they fail to properly  address  the  crucial  role  intermediaries  play  in
copyright infringements.  Internet  ‘intermediaries’  are  in  essence  ‘the
gatekeepers’  of  the  Internet  and  are  indispensable  to  the  goal   of
preventing IPR infringement. That is why the role these intermediaries  play
– and can play – in curbing digital piracy needs to be reviewed. It  is  our
conviction that an effective and comprehensive solution to curb  piracy  can
only be obtained through  their  co-operation.  So-called  ‘intermediaries’,
who’s  services  are  used  in  infringing  activities,  both  directly  and
indirectly, bear responsibility and have  the  obligation  to  prevent  such
infringements.

We feel that on the whole Article 8(3) of the  Copyright  Directive  is  one
effective  tool  in  achieving  cooperation  from   intermediaries   against
copyright infringement, but feel that in certain ways it  is  lacking.  This
is in particular due to the crucial issue  that  some  Member  States  still
have not implemented this provision and the corresponding provisions in  the
Enforcement Directive in  a  correct  manner.   As  a  result,  some  Member
States’ legislative frameworks still require the finding  of  some  form  of
liability on the part of the intermediary, such as in  Germany  and  Sweden.
The lack of implementation of Article 8(3) means that some  national  courts
still hold that injunctions against intermediaries can only  be  granted  if
the intermediary can be imputed  with  liability.   Of  course,  injunctions
under Article 8(3) are granted on the basis that the intermediary  is  “best
placed”  (ref.  Recital  59  of  the  Copyright  Directive)  to  bring   the
infringement to an end and this has been confirmed in the recent  CJEU  case
law. However, national courts in Member States that lack  implementation  of
Article 8(3) do not follow  this  precedent.   We  therefore  call  for  the
correct implementation of Article  8(3)  by  all  Member  States  to  foster
cooperation by intermediaries.

A  second  point  is  that  right   holders’   cooperation   with   Internet
stakeholders in  the  fight  against  online  infringements  is  also  often
frustrated by the fact that Internet intermediaries generally do not  record
client data or they record inaccurate client data.  Internet  intermediaries
such as domain name providers, hosting  providers,  payment  providers,  and
online ad-brokers should be subject  to  “know  your  customer”  obligations
(see Article 5 of  the  Enforcement  Directive)  and  the  money  laundering
Directives.  In particular, right holders should have  the  legal  means  to
identify and locate commercial scale infringers.  The CJEU has confirmed  in
L’Oreal v. eBay that infringers operating in the course  of  trade  must  be
identifiable.  See paragraph 142 in L’Oreal v. eBay. The  existing EU  “know
your customer”  (KYC)  legislation  (see  3rd  Money  Laundering  Directive)
applies to banks, lawyers, real estate agents, casinos and we  suggest  that
it should also be made applicable  to  Internet  intermediaries.   Anonymous
businesses prevent the legal system from working  in  a  fair  and  balanced
manner.

Furthermore,  mere  notice  and  takedown  procedures  are  insufficient  to
address infringements that are taking place on a  massive  scale,  and  much
greater clarity is needed in this area. We  believe  it  is  reasonable  and
appropriate to expect such ‘intermediaries’ - as lawful businesses - to  aid
in the prevention of abuse  of  their  services  for  illegal  purposes.  As
pointed out in the previous consultation, there  are  many  steps  they  can
take that have been proven to be effective without being unduly  burdensome.
Furthermore, we would also recommend adapting the Directive in  a  way  that
recognises the role ‘intermediaries’ play and the responsibility they  bear.
Their responsibility should also be  clear  in  relation  to  the  liability
exemption put in place by the E-commerce Directive. The term  ‘intermediary’
is highly ambiguous and in  practice  often  misleading.  That  is  why  the
definition of an ‘intermediary’ which is eligible for a liability  exemption
requires clarity in order to distinguish them from irresponsible actors.  It
would be preferable if the Directive describes the types of activities  that
will disqualify this service from being able to invoke one of the  liability
exemptions   under   the   E-Commerce   Directive.   This    will    prevent
‘intermediaries’ from taking advantage of the broad  scope  of  the  current
definition.

In addition, we argue that a service which structurally  and  systematically
facilitates copyright infringement whilst  generating  revenues  should  not
qualify for the liability privileges set forth in Articles 12-14 of  the  E-
Commerce Directive. This principle is  clear  from  both  decisions  by  the
Court of Justice of the European Union and the  majority  of  national  case
law. However, certain  decisions  at  national  level  have  addressed  this
matter incorrectly. It would be helpful to clarify that such sites  are  not
only subject to injunction orders requiring them to  filter  out  infringing
content, but that  they  may  also  be  subject  to  criminal  and/or  civil
liability.

We wish to draw the Commission’s attention to a number of issues arising  in
connection   with   attempts   to   obtain   injunctive    relief    against
intermediaries.  In  several  Member  States  these  attempts  are  severely
undermined by the failure  to  implement  the  specific  provisions  of  the
Copyright and the Enforcement Directives. In certain  cases,  Member  States
have turned to general civil law rules.  However,  conflicting  rules  often
create problems for the courts where an intermediary under civil law is  not
necessarily liable for the underlying infringements.


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain


The current situation in the EU is manifested in recent  decisions  made  by
the CJEU (Promusicae, L'Oreal  v.  eBay  and  Sabam  v.  Netlog)  that  have
clarified that national courts  shall  apply  the  proportionality  test  in
adjudicating on matters involving a  balancing  of  right  to  having  one’s
copyright protected and other rights such as protection  of  personal  data.
These decisions have emphasised the need to  weigh  all  fundamental  rights
before coming to a fair and balanced decision.   In  doing  so,  the  courts
shall take into  account  the  rights  and  interests  of  the  parties  and
stakeholders concerned.


Nevertheless, despite this situation we feel that there are  certain  issues
in the current civil enforcement framework  that  need  further  refinement.
The right to property is a fundamental right as much as  the  right  to  the
protection of personal data, but there is a need  for  equal  treatment  and
correct balancing of the different rights. It is clear that data  protection
rights cannot mean tolerance for illegal activities by actors who  purposely
hide behind this right, disqualifying in this way the right to property.


Often the only tool available for rightsholders to attempt  to  take  action
against infringers in these cases is the right of information,  provided  by
Article 8(1) of the Enforcement Directive. Unfortunately,  we  see  that  in
practice the right to obtain information about infringers has been put  into
question in some countries due to  the  unclear  relationship  between  data
protection rules and enforcement rules at EU level. In general it seems  the
Article 8(1) is implemented differently across Member States,  and  in  some
cases is deprived of any effect. A number of Member States  and/or  national
courts interpret data protection rules  as  preventing  the  acquisition  of
data which would be  helpful  in  identifying  online  infringers.  In  such
cases, this reduces the number of remedies right  holders  have  to  enforce
their rights at national level. With regards to the first paragraph of  this
answer  which  concerns  the  power  of   national   courts   use   of   the
proportionality test, it is clear that there  is  the  potential  for  great
difference in approach across Europe and a  deficiency  in  legal  certainty
for rightsholders. In some  Member  States,  the  relationship  between  the
right of information and data protection/data  retention  rules  is  unclear
and in other Member States, data protection rules prevent  disclosure.  This
is why it would  be  desirable  to  clarify  the  interaction  between  data
protection rules  and  the  implementation  of  the  Enforcement  Directive,
making sure that data protection does  not  prejudice  the  possibility  for
right holders to protect their rights.


However, while  protecting  copyright  in  support  of  creative  industries
should be a priority fulfilled through a more  efficient  civil  enforcement
system in the EU, it is just  one  component  of  the  solution  to  address
widespread infringement, and we believe that a comprehensive  approach  that
maintains proper protection of property rights, access to  justice,  freedom
of expression and data protection is possible.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ NO OPINION


If the question of the establishment of  a  single  EU  Copyright  Title  to
create a consistent framework is to be addressed, there  should  be  a  more
robust definition than the one that is provided in this consultation.


If the establishment of  a  single  EU  Copyright  Title  were  to  be  done
alongside national titles, CEPI would  have  particular  concerns  with  the
potential  for  such  a  situation  actually  adding  a  further  layer   of
complexity to  the  copyright  system  in  the  EU.  We  feel  that  further
complexity is unnecessary and is best avoided.  The  current  EU  acquis  is
already perfectly sufficient for the protection of copyright.  There  is  no
evidence that there are negative effects  on  the  internal  market  arising
from the framework now in place.


Were the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title  to  be  created  in
replacement of each of the national copyright titles of  the  Member  States
then this is something that would take decades to achieve. The  strength  of
national preoccupations expressed  at  the  adoption  of  the  EU  Copyright
Directive make simply replacing current national copyright  systems  with  a
single European Copyright Title seem premature and far too complex.  A  very
careful  and  in-depth  impact  assessment  would  be  required  before  any
initiative is started, in order to  comprehensively  lay  out  the  asserted
improvement of the current situation by such a single Title.







  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

As we have already noted before, the question  of  the  establishment  of  a
single EU  Copyright  Title  can  only  be  addressed  when  a  more  robust
definition than that provided in this consultation is established.

When looking at Article 118 of the  Lisbon  Treaty,  CEPI  does  not  see  a
specific competency of the EU with regard to copyright, and whether  it  can
even be  extended  to  include  copyright.  In  CEPI’s  understanding,  this
provision was in  fact  meant  to  address  issues  related  to  “industrial
property rights”. According to the House of Lords  of  the  United  Kingdom,
“the new Article 118 of the  TFEU  is  a  restatement  of  existing  powers.
Although the Treaty of Lisbon would not confer additional IP powers  on  the
EU, it marks a statement of political intent and a commitment  to  achieving
the Community patent.”[1] So far all EU legislation that  has  been  adopted
in the field  of  intellectual  property  have  a  legal  basis  in  general
internal market provisions of the  treaties.  They  remain  the  appropriate
legal basis for all intellectual property basis.





VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[10] Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council
of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

European Copyright Code (establishing a single title)  see  section  VII  of
this consultation document.
[16] Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
22 May 2001 on  the  harmonisation  of  certain  aspects  of  copyright  and
related rights in the information society.

[18] Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

279/13 (C More entertainment).

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[31] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

[40] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[46] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own

two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
