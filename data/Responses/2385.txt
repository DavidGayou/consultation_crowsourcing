      Copyright Clearance Center, Inc. (CCC) is the main collective licensing entity in the
      United States of America for text-based materials providing per-use and repertory

                                                                                          1
   licensing services as agent for rightsholders as well as software and rights management
   services to both rightsholders and users.
   Founded in 1978 as a not-for-profit organization at the suggestion of the U.S.
   Congress, CCC provides solutions that simplify the access and licensing of text
   content. These solutions let businesses, academic institutions, other organizations and
   also individuals quickly get permission to share copyright-protected materials, while
   compensating the rightsholders for the use of their works. CCC has paid the equivalent
   of more than € 1 billion in royalties to rightsholders over the past 10 years, while
   providing information solutions (repertory licenses, transactional permissions and
   rights management tools) to all manner of users.
   In 2010, CCC established RightsDirect as a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Europe
   to meet the needs of European-based companies. CCC and RightsDirect cooperate
   with a large number of rightsholders and CMOs to provide copyright compliance
   solutions in Europe.
   We limit our submission to the questions most relevant to ourselves, as a collective
   licensing and rights management entity based outside the EU.

   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
  NO
  NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
  NO
  NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
As an agent for rightsholders who have entered into voluntary arrangements with us, CCC has
been receiving and granting users’ requests for permissions and licenses for the re-use of text-
based materials across borders for over 20 years. In addition, we have been offering multi-
territorial repertory licenses in our field for almost 15 years on behalf of the rightsholders who
have voluntarily authorized us to do so, covering licensees’ employees in nearly every
country in the world. Today, we issue and/or renew hundreds of such repertory licenses to
larger business organizations every year. Together with our thousands of U.S.-only repertory
licenses, we estimate that we cover more than 25 million employees of businesses.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?



                                                                                                3
For text, market-based solutions either offered directly by rightsholders, or offered by CMOs
and licensing agents on a voluntary, non-exclusive, opt-in basis, work well on the basis of the
current regime.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
X NO
  NO OPINION
6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples


  NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES
X NO – Please explain
We believe that the Services Directive (Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006 on
services in the internal market) should continue to be deemed to apply to copyright
management services (even if by its terms it does not apply to copyright itself).
  NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES



                                                                                              4
      NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
   required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach1)
       NO OPINION


   9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
   of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
   whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
   transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
   (including the availability of injunctive relief2)?
       YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
       NO
       NO OPINION

1. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
   10.    [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
   two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
   download) create problems for you?
      YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
   problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
   to achieve the "bundling of rights")
       NO
       NO OPINION

2. Linking and browsing
   11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
   protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
   the authorisation of the rightholder?
      YES– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
   circumstances, and why
      NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
   circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
   public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
       NO OPINION




   1
     The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
   be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
   which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
   States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
   regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
   copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
   2
      Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
   an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                                   5
12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
    YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
X NO

Temporary reproductions that are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of
a technological process, under the conditions established in article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29
should not require additional consent. Compliance with article 5.1 will depend on the specific
circumstances of particular cases.

  NO OPINION
13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
  NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
As a general matter, digital content is not sold but licensed. Thus, in a market economy like
that of the EU, freely-negotiable license terms should prevail over efforts to convert licenses
to “sales” by operation of law. Laws which forbid restrictions on redistribution (or “resale”)
of digital copies obtained under license, like other laws that seek to restrict the freedom of
private parties to create lawful terms (including restrictions) in their contracts with each other,
may lead to higher prices and fewer options, in this case for consumers. Further, such laws
will inevitably make rightsholders more cautious about entering into new digital markets and
experimenting with new business models. An actual marketplace example in our text field:
users may receive copies of electronic works under a variety of conditions, including
streaming that permits no retention (at low cost, which enables the user to make a no-retention
decision or a decision to acquire additional rights), discounted purchases (including for value
exchanged [information, endorsements, etc.] that may include no money), the bundling of
print and electronic copies, or subscription access for a specified time period or for authorized
users only. Regulation aimed at enforcing one particular business model (uncontrolled
redistribution or “resale”) that can negatively affect all these other possible ways to monetize
content will inevitably stifle innovation, especially at the lower-cost part of the market –
specifically, the consumer should continue to have the freedom of choice between a low-price
offer with redistribution (or “resale”) restrictions attached, and a full-price offer without
restrictions (which would be the only offer possible under a “all redistribution is permitted”
statutory mandate).




                                                                                                 6
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
  YES
      NO
  XNO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
With registration, rightsholder information could be available and searchable.


17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Registration may place a burden on rightsholders, and particularly the smallest rightsholders
with the least time and money to bear the burdens. Assuming that any such system is
voluntary (and therefore does not violate the Berne Convention), it will require the inclusion
of explicit benefits to encourage voluntary compliance.


18.        What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
Special damages and presumptions could attach to registration.



D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
The EU should promote the development of an EU gateway to information about copyright,
about copyright rights and their holders, and about ways to obtain licences or get permission
to use others’ works; such promotion will inevitably also promote the development of
individual private and Member State databases of all kinds of information about copyrighted
works. Supporters of the existing international systems of identifiers make some effort to
ensure that they are interoperable wherever possible; as an example, CCC uses every well-
known national and international identifier system applicable to our business (and not only
those used for text) in essentially all of our internal, and many of our external, processes in
order to promote efficiency (and we even assign our own identifiers when we need to, and
share those with our business partners). The EU could usefully look at some notable
initiatives at the national level and their reliance on the use of multiplier identifier systems to
promote the broadest possible success (e.g., the U.K. Copyright Hub). If identifiers are
widely used, the likelihood of interoperability of rightsholding and permissions databases is
“naturally” increased.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?



                                                                                                 7
20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X YES
Whether the environment is digital or analogue is irrelevant to the question of term of
protection. We do not see the need for a change of the term of copyright at this stage.

  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
  NO OPINION

  II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
X NO – Please explain
Variations in law across Europe are familiar to both Europeans and visitors. Nothing in the
creation of the European Union was intended to remove all those variations, primarily
because they reflect different histories, different values, different cultures, and different
priorities among the Member States. Most agree that this is in fact a strength of the Union. In
this context, the EU copyright directives provide the overall framework of what type of
copyright exceptions and limitations there can be, thereby providing a degree of guaranteed
protection to creators across the EU and a general, even if imprecise, sense of the scope of
freedom left to the user. Nevertheless, even an exhaustive and compulsory list of limitations
and exceptions transposed into national law would not resolve the purported problem because
there can be no guarantee of uniform interpretation by all courts throughout the EU as those
courts are still informed by the different histories, etc., of the countries in which they sit.
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
X NO – Please explain
The current system allows Member States to put in place exceptions that suit their particular
cultural and social needs as long as they stay within an agreed framework. They can take into
account existing business solutions and user habits. Fully harmonised exceptions carry with
them the risk of being too rigid and inadaptable to change.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
No. In CCC’s view, the current system is reasonably balanced and allows for the market to
address user needs through flexible and efficient solutions, as evidenced by, for example, the
“Licenses for Europe” dialogue in which our organization actively participated.

                                                                                             8
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
X NO – Please explain why
The EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions is sufficiently flexible.
  NO OPINION
25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
As noted above, our core business is in administering copyright licenses as an intermediary
between rightsholders and users. In our experience, the parties to a multi-territorial licence
are ready and able to define the scope of the license, the rights it covers and the territories it
covers. And one reason to do so is to avoid the gaps and ambiguities that can arise from
relying on limitations and exceptions. Thus, differences in limitations and exceptions
between different territories become irrelevant to the parties’ ability to formulate their
intentions in a licensing agreement.
  NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

The applicable law should be that of the country where a work is used and protection is
sought.

The primary responsibility for paying fair compensation should be on the user, with the
person or entity providing the copy having secondary liability, or possibly a kind of
“subsidiary joint and several liability”. This ensures both that the creator/rightsholder
receives the appropriate financial reward for her/his creation/rights, and that the provider has
some practical incentive to ensure lawful, effective and efficient business practices.




                                                                                                9
   A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
1. Preservation and archiving
   28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
   problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
   subject matter in your collection?
   (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
   libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
      YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
   X NO
      NO OPINION


   29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   Market-based solutions such as PORTICO and CLOCKSS have provided enormously
   efficient ways to archive and protect scientific content. For more information on these joint
   publisher-librarian projects, see: http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation. To date more
   than 300 million files have been preserved in this way by Portico. For more information on
   CLOCKSS, see http://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home.
   30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
   elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
   which conditions?
   None needed.

   31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   None needed.

2. Off-premises access to library collections
   32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
   problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
   provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
   purposes of research and private study?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
   problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter
   held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you
   are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
   institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
   borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
   and private study?
   Many licenses issued by the rightsholders with whom we work contain provisions on remote
   access, often cross-border. The nature and extent of remote access is negotiated and can
   affect pricing and other terms.



                                                                                               10
   33.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
   Market-based solutions can, and in many instances are already solving any potential
   problems. Rightsholders and their representatives (like us at CCC) can and do issue cross-
   border licenses.


   34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
   elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
   which conditions?
   Legislation is likely to quash innovation and limit choices in business models (for both
   rightsholders and users) and is therefore not needed.


   35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
   Not needed.

3. E – lending
   36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
   trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
   borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
   (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
   when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
   borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
   (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
   to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
   X YES – Please explain with specific examples
   The rightsholders with whom we work regularly inform us (as we seek to assist them by
   developing new license models and new rights management tools) that they routinely
   negotiate in-nation and cross-border lending agreements, both with individual libraries and
   with library consortia. These agreements enable libraries and sometimes other entities to lend
   copyrighted works electronically, including, when possible, across borders.
     NO
     NO OPINION

   37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

   Any problems would best be solved (a) by ensuring full compliance with national laws and
   (b) by safeguarding the freedom of parties to contract with each other, including with regard
   to cross-border licenses.

   The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

   38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
   management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
   subscribers? What problems have you encountered?


                                                                                                11
   39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
   libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
   activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
   problems have you encountered?


4. Mass digitisation
   40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
   digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
   necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
   (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
   border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
     NO – Please explain
   X NO OPINION


   41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
   other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
   X NO OPINION

   B.     Teaching
   42.      (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
   experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
   illustration for teaching, including across borders?
   (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
   resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
   teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
     NO
     NO OPINION

   43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


   44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
   illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
   The rightsholders with whom we work regularly authorize use of content for teaching
   purposes through individual licensing agreements as part of voluntary market-based licenses

may also apply.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
No legislative solution is needed, as this might limit new business models and consumer
choice.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC3 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

research purposes? How successful are they?


D.         Disabilities
50.     (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?

E.     Text and data mining
53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
X YES – Please explain
The rightsholders with whom we work frequently report adverse implications from
unauthorized TDM for their websites and business models, particularly as TDM-related
crawling of websites poses security risks and can adversely affect website performance.
TDM can also facilitate the unauthorised creation of derivative works, and it is not always
possible to distinguish between a legitimate researcher and an entity who wishes to scan or
copy content for piratical purposes. CCC is currently conducting a pilot project (on which we
reported in the framework of the “Licences for Europe” dialogue) offering TDM solutions to
both rightsholders and researchers on the basis of standardization of access and formats and
centralization of administration. More information on our pilot project is available here:

  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION


54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As outlined in our response to Q53, CCC is working on a licensing solution for TDM that will
serve the needs of both rightsholders and users. In addition, many of the rightsholders with
whom we work are working on market-based solutions themselves. As the barriers to TDM

                                                                                           14
are largely technological, they cannot be practically addressed by legislation. Further,
imposing legislative rules on TDM, a still developing concept, before all sides can actually
develop frameworks for solutions will discourage innovation, in particular by rightsholders
and intermediaries who will be unwilling to devote resources to projects and technologies that
may be made redundant, obsolete or unworkable by premature legislation.

55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
There is no need for a legislative solution and, as noted above, legislative intrusion into this
still-developing field is as likely, and maybe more likely, to create impediments to TDM as to
resolve them. TDM as a beginning-to-end service proposition, involving among other steps
simultaneous access to multiple sources of content in searchable formats, orderly
administration of searches and search functions, data security for both rightsholders and users,
and delivery of content in both machine-readable and human-readable formats, is already in
development with participation from both willing rightsholders and willing users all looking
for a solution. Until that service proposition is tested, revised and re-tested in the market,
legislative activity is at a minimum premature.
56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See our response to Q55. Market-based solutions are most likely to achieve the best -
balanced result among the needs and desires of all interested parties.
57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
The highest barriers to the use of TDM methods are technological and security issues.

F.     User-generated content
58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
  NO OPINION


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?

                                                                                             15
X YES – Please explain
CCC’s services do not discriminate on the basis of who a purported rightsholder is or what
he/she/it has created or represents. As a result, any “user” who has created or otherwise
represents a copyrightable work to which he/she/it has legal rights to license is, for our
purposes, a rightsholder, and as such is welcome to participate in our services on precisely
equal terms to those available to any other rightsholder.

    III.      Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions4 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
X NO – Please explain
There is no need for change: the principles set out in the Copyright Directive apply to private
copying and reprography exceptions and limitations.

Levies, and in particular equipment levies, remain important in the digital environment as
they amount to at least some remuneration for the rightsholder: although there may be a small
risk of double payment, there is little indication of that and in any event it does not outweigh
the larger risk of “no payments” to rightsholders. Moreover, to the extent fees are paid by
different entities receiving different benefits from the creative work (e.g., users, hardware
manufacturers, ISPs), there is no risk of double payment unless the specific fee was paid twice
on behalf of the same user for the same use.
    NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?5
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain
    NO OPINION

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?6
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain
    NO OPINION


68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
    NO – Please explain
    NO OPINION

extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

system, how would these problems best be solved?




 IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain why
  NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?

  V.     Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
X YES – Please explain.
See answer to Q76.


  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

                                                                                       18
Under the current legal framework, intermediaries and advertisers have little incentive to
cooperate on the fight against copyright infringement.
Moreover, ISPs have in most cases the means to filter infringing content but choose not to do
so, and even in the case of a notice and take-down procedure, are under no obligation to filter
against reposting.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VII.      Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
