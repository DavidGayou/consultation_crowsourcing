            I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now 4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider

context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

             I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.
10  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

   E.Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
   authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

1. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
   The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
   environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
   field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
   software17 and databases18.


   16 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
   certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
   17 Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection

   of computer programs.
   18 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

   databases.
                                                                                                              11
   Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
   are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
   protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
   networks.

   The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
   authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
   e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
   at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
   communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
   dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
   transmissions and both need to be cleared.

2. The act of “making available”

   Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
   upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
   “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
   territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
   need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
   only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
   countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
   Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
   a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
   (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
   service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
   country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
   a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

        8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
           content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

     YES
     NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
    required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
    approach23)
   19 Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
   respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
   referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
   matter”.
   20 The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and

   in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
   a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   21
      The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
   or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
   22
      See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
   related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
   Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
   however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
   23
      The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
   must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
   State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
                                                                                                                   12

        9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
           scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your
           rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
           considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on
           the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief24)?

3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

   Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
   law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
   transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
   licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
   persons/entities.

        10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
            two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
            a download) create problems for you?

     YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
    problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
    to achieve the "bundling of rights")

4. Linking and browsing

   Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
   They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
   pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
   a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
   public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
   A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
   works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
   memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
   copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
   provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

        11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
            protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
            subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

     YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
    circumstances, and why

    No, a link is how, on the internet, you point to something. It is not because the thing you
    point at is copyrighted, that you should not be able to refer to it. Imagine someone putting
    on his Facebook wall: “Visisted Le Louvre in Paris, and very much liked this painting <link
    to copyrighted painting hopefully on the Louvre website, but if not there, probably on
    another website>. Should he be prosecuted because of linking to copyrighted material?
    Everybody is guilty somewhere in his live then.

            circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

    computer of the viewer. It is silly to even think about a separate concept for this. If, as a
    right holder, you do not want copies on the viewer's computer, then do not allow to put your
    content on a website. This should also include copies for data-mining and eventually giving
    back meta-data about this data-mining (e.g. Google news).

5. Download to own digital content

   Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
   Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
   (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
   distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
   article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
   distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
   also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
   (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
   notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
   keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
   the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
   a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
   second-hand market for physical goods).

        13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
            trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

     YES – Please explain by giving examples

    Not really reselling, but sharing/lending.

    In the old days of books, when you read a good book, you talked about it and lend it to your
    friends/relatives. Lending a book was considered as good manner and being nice to your
    friends.


   27
     See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
   28In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
   hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
   period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
   exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
   case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
   emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
   exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
   56).
                                                                                                                  15
Now, with digital reproduction, when you hear nice music, view a nice film, or read a nice
ebook, you can even more easily than before, 'lend' (or share, the consept of 'lending' makes
no sense with digital material) it to your friends. The difference is that before, with books,
lending was considered as civilised behaviour, while now, 'lending' is considered as
criminal behaviour by some organisations in our society.



Of course, there is the problem that by allowing digital sharing, the right-holders are not
compensated anymore. If those are just middleman, let them do something else in life.
However, they brandish the argument that if nobody is compelled to pay for content
anymore, no content will be produced. Some counter arguments can be formulated:

- From what a content consumer pays, very little goes to the content creators. Most of the
money goes to the middle man. And then there is the question if income should be
generated during 70 years. 5 years seems more than enough.

- It is only in the 20th century that so much people were able to pay for entertainment.
Before, much less money was available and you had rich people or institutions paying for
culture (e.g. Bach, Mozart,...). One could argue that you had less choice and that a few
people dictated what 'art' could be created. Well, this is the same now: there is a diversity in
culture created, but most of the money goes to very uniform, low-risk, content (e.g.
Hollywood films and pop music).

- Even if copyright serves a need by returning money to content creators, it has an huge cost
on society: the natural urge to share things is criminalised. Everybody agrees that having a
business that profits of content created by others without contributing content back should
not be the norm. But is it worth to criminalise half of the population just to avoid those kind
of businesses?

- Is a world without copyright (or with a much more restricted copyright framework, where
individuals cannot be prosecuted for disproportional amounts of money or even jailed)
really bad for art? There is a good example of this in the software industry. Richard
Stallman founded the free software foundation in 1984 with the aim of creating software
that could be copied and adapted freely. The only (important) restriction was that someone
distributing that software (or an improvement/variation of it) was obliged to give the same
rights to the persons he distributed it to (thus he could not forbid them to also make copies
and modified versions). This is what is commonly referred to as the GPL license. An
important example of software under GPL is the Linux kernel, the basis of all Linux
distributions and thus also the basis of the Android (software released by Google for
operating smart phones).

Even that restriction was for some people too restrictive and they created the open source
movement: here you could take the software, distribute it and forbid to make a copy (of
course your clients could always go to the original software and make a copy of that one, so
forbidding distribution made only sense if you modified the original one). A successful
example of such software is Apache, the software that runs a major part of the websites in
the world but also Apple is using such software in its operating systems (OSX is BSD
based).



                                                                                              16
 Thus apparently distributing the software for free, did not kill that software industry. On the
 contrary: open source and free software are a huge commercial success.

 Art and creative content is different than software but maybe that a more permissive
 copyright framework would not make the world poorer in creative content. As it is now, a
 song is finished once the original creator releases it. Someone else maybe thinks about a
 better interpretation, or an adaption, or combining it with video, or... As it stands now, he is
 not allowed to do it unless he goes through the legal troubles of trying to get permission. It
 is defendable if the song is just released, but can you defend it for a song from the sixties?
 Create some content and get revenue for the rest of your live and the live of your children
 (or more probably the company having the rights)?

 There should also be a concept of falling in the public domain for certain content. The
 poster-child example is Happy Birthday which some companies claim is still under their
 copyright. Like with trademarks (bic is now a generic word for a writing utensil and no
 longer a trademark), at a certain point a song is so entrenched in the public culture that
 extracting money for performance should not be allowed.

F.Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

     15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
         and licensing of works and other subject matter?

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
                                                                                                             17
 YES

 NO OPINION



    16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]

Before digital dissemination, producing copies of original work was a substantial portion of
the final cost to the consumer. Dissemination in the digital age is now almost free.

It would thus make sense that authors receiving copyright, contribute back. One important
part of governmental organisations is keeping records of culture (e.g. libraries). One could
imagine a system where in return for copyright protection, one gives a copy of the work to a
digital library where it becomes free for everybody to download after the copyright expires.



    17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Open question]

That the system becomes too complex for one individual to use (cf patents where you need
to pay the price of a small house to get 1 patent; it is thus out of reach for a a private
person). It would be important that an individual can easily register for copyright.

That it will somehow be abused by huge organisations (cf patent trolls).



    18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

[Open question]

Prolonged copyright. Make the default copyright 5 years (no registration). If you register,
you can get 10 years.




G.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are


                                                                                          18
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?

 [Open question]

 As described above, the EU could make a central repository. All those private initiatives by
 the music/film industry have one goal: extracting more money out of the customer. The EU,
 as an organisations by and for citizens, should balance this:

 1) Shorten copyright. 5-10 years is more than appropriate (with a grand maximum of 20
 years). Long copyright terms made sense when

       a) In practice it was difficult to disseminate your work worldwide, so you had to
 recoup costs over a long time in a limited area. Now a days, music/films/books can be sold
 and bought world-wide (with the harmonisation of copyright law within the EU, it will
 make it probably even easier for copyright owners).

         b) Dissemination of works took time, due to the huge physical logistics. This is much
 less now with the electronic dissemination, so profiteering from copyright starts much
 faster.

 2) Make sure are as much work as possible is available to the public.

        a) Registration should require to make the work available. The EU database with
 copyrighted works could include an online store where every registered work can be bought.
 Right-holders can set a price (within certain limits: e.g. not 1000 euros for 1 song) and
 eventually a certain dead-time where the work is not available (typical example are films
 where people are first pushed to the cinemas before being able to buy the film online). This
 will avoid the current situations where books from 30 years ago that are not popular, cannot
 be bought anymore, as the original copyright holder sees no money in releasing them.

        b) Works for which the copyright is expired, should be made available for free.
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

H.Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

     20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
         environment?
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 This is completely absurd. 50 years after the dead of the author. 70 years after being
 released. That is completely insane and one of the reasons why copyright is not taken
 seriously.

 If you did not get rich after 5-20 years of monopoly on your work, then you never will. On
 the other hand, if you got rich, why should the law protect you help you in getting even
 richer?

 The next generation should be able to freely use what the previous generation made. It is
 really not defensible that you should pay licensing fees to someone for reading books
 written 50 years ago, or viewing films/television series of the sixties. This comes over as
 racketeering.

             I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.


35
  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
36Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
                                                                                                             20
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

can be used and accessed in all Member States.

      Access to content in libraries and archives
      Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
      limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
      establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
      of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
      matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
      limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
      governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

      Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
      envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
      the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
      exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
      rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
      stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

      The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
      cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
      works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
      works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
      laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
      from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
      types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
      of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
      new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
      content) is often uncertain.

             28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
                 problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
                 or other subject matter in your collection?

1. Off-premises access to library collections
   Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
   matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
   premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
   consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
   the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
   between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
   should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
   collections.

           problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you

2. E – lending
   Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
   also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
   technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
   such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
   need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
   various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
   business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
   to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
       36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
          when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
          including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

                                                                                                26

3. Mass digitisation
   The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
   libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
   an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
                                                                                                   27
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

     40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
         mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
         Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
         results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
         collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can
         be accessed across the EU?

     41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
         other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’

  YES – Please explain
44        You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45 France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°

2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.
                                                                                                             28
 Audio/Visual are a big part of our culture. Technology now allows keeping them in an
 “electronic library” for relative little cost compared to the physical national libraries that are
 the norm for print works. Of course, the public pays for this, thus the public should also
 profit from it. Therefore such a system should be connected to an obliged selling of the
 creative works for a reasonable fee to the public through the library interface. A newly
 released work can cost more. A work of 40 years ago should be free.

I.Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

        42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-
            matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

a) From an ethical point of view, teachers should not be limited in their creativity to

b) They should not be seen as freeloaders, but as ambassadors/sales people that work for
free for those creating creative content.

   45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under what conditions?
[Open question]
All teaching activity should be exempted from royalty payments. No organisation should be
discriminated because e.g. it is not an state sponsored university. For example, the local
beekeepers club should be able to show a video about some beekeeping technique without
copyright hassles. A speaker at that local bee club should be able to use all illustrations he
finds without tracking down the copyright for each illustration.

As compensation (but this is also a matter of being civilised), teachers should clearly
reference the material they use, so that people seeing it, can go back to the original work
and eventually buy it. Furthermore, if you make a collage of copyright work, you should not
be able to claim copyright on that and should accept that other teachers also use your work
freely.

Which brings us to an important part of that teacher exemption: there is a lot of duplicate
effort in that teachers never make their course notes/slide shows world-wide available,
because they are afraid of copyright lawsuits. This results in a lot of duplicate effort and
mediocre course notes.

J.Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their

  YES – Please explain

 The frustration of every researcher when he finds an interesting abstract and cannot access
 the full article. It makes no sense: public resources are used to fund the research, and then,
 public funding must be used for other researchers to know about and read that research. The
 tax payer pays two times. There is clearly an abuse of copyright here (scientific publishing
 companies are very profitable).

 It is important to not criminalise people infringing copyright. Cooperation and sharing is
 natural for most people. Thus someone sharing copyrighted work without license, should
 not be harassed more than someone running a red light or speeding (two things that are
 frowned upon, but that not directly make you a criminal). As it is presented now by some
 copyright-holders, people (individuals without direct commercial motives) sharing
 copyrighted content without a valid license, are depicted as criminals (e.g. the warning you
 get before being able to play a DVD).

K.Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

         representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with

L.Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that

51For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

    55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
        elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
Mass infringement of copyrighted material should not destroy someone's live. If a
researcher/student is downloading all possible articles he can, it should not be considered as
1 article costs 30 euros so, 10000 articles cost 300000 euros + criminal charges. The EU
should       really      avoid      having        cases       like       Aaron       Schwartz

M.User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

     58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
         problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
         disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?


53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.
                                                                                          37
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

     21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

 The physical production of copies of copyright content does cost less and less. Buying
 content online implicitly grands you permission to make a copy on your computer/smart
 phone. You have a license to “consume” that content. It would be silly if you had to pay
 every time you watch that film, play that song, read that book (or a passage of the book).
 Then why should you pay if you transfer that content from you main computer, where you
 bought it, to you tablet/tv/smartphone, where you “consume” it. It is very greedy from the
 publishers to ask money from each device where potentially copyrighted material could be
 put. More and more content is also released under creative common licenses, where the
 authors do not ask royalties. Should part of the levies not also go to them? The usual
 organisations representing right-holders have not the monopoly anymore on content
 distribution, and thus all the money from levies should not go to them (or the levies should
 be reduced).

     23. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
         (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have

         business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
 [Open question]

 Once, as a right-holder, you grand a license to someone, it should not matter what that
 person does with it (apart from public performances and public distribution). Hence levies
 for private copies should be abolished.



     24. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

 The levies system is actually a disguised subsidizing of the entertainment industry. Now
 they profit from both sides:

 a) They are subsidized (system of levies).

 b) The have still an (for all practical purposes) infinite copyright on the creative works they
 own, and can thus also get money from selling that work.

 If a lack of copyright (or a very reduced form) would be so disastrous for the entertainment
 industries, why not go to a full subsidizing system either governmental but also private e.g.
 the popularity of kickstarter projects. If there is one thing that kickstarter shows, it is that
 people         will         pay        for         content        they         like        (e.g.
 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/set-chopin-free). Thus the lack of copyright
 seems not so disastrous as some organisations would make us to believe.


                I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

        21. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
            combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
            for the exploitation of your works and performances?

             I.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

     21. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
         infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66 For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend

on the volume of traffic.
67 This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by

Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
                                                                                                           42
 NO – Please explain

There are much more important issues that the EU should address than copyright
infringement such as economic recession, bank fraud and online pishing attacks,
environmental issues, maternity leave (why do Swedish parents, rightfully, get more than
one year to take care of their baby while Belgian mothers get 4 months?), competitive
advantage, infrastructure works (the EU should avoid the privatisation of roads i.e. creation
of toll-roads by private companies which is a reincarnation of the toll everybody had to pay
in the Middle Ages, when entering a city). Copyright infringement is really not an important
problem compared to other socio-economical issues.

    22. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
        involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
        brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
        online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
        would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

              I.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the

                                                                                           43
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

    21. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
        a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
        copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION



    22. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the

           I.Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

    21. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
        copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
There is a trend by certain copyright-holders to criminalise copyright infringement and
asking for stiff penalties for (private) infringers (e.g. 3 strikes law in France). It is very
dangerous to if the EU goes with this thought: people do not consider downloading a film or
sharing an MP3 as a serious crime. This is more like speeding 10km over the speed limit or
not paying your parking ticket.

People will not only perceive copyright as unjust, but will also loose faith in the judicial
system if the punishment is not in relation to the crime. Damages of thousands of euros for
sharing some films/music are really not acceptable.

Public infrastructure should also not be misused/monopolised by copyright-holders. Internet
Service Providers (ISP) should not be burned with the task to filter out copyright material
from the data their customers are downloading/uploading. This for 2 reasons:



                                                                                            44
1) It makes their operations more expensive which results in higher prices for the end-user.
This is thus a indirect tax again from the entertainment industry: even users not profiting
from their content have to pay for their copyright protection.

2) This is an invasion of the privacy of the consumers. Nobody would dare to suggest to
systematically open all post-packages to check if there are psychoactive drugs inside. You
only may open certain packages if there are strong indications (and even then, only with a
search-warrant). Opening a letter is a crime. The same protection should be given to data
flowing through your home network connection. This also consists of private
communications (email) that are equivalent to letters. But apparently, because it is digital, it
is OK to sieve through all content of everybody to detect (minor) crimes about copyright
infringement.



The problem with the current entertainment industry is that they assume that every
entertainment people consume without paying something, is a loss the equivalent of the full
price of the item consumed. This is not true, students/broke people have a very limited
budget and will try to download as much free content as possible. Downloading copyrighted
material is a hassle, but having no money and relatively enough time, it is worth it. Once
someone gets a stable income and no time anymore (kids, other hobbies,...), he has no time
anymore to try to download material. He is happy to pay a reasonable price to watch all the
films possible and get all the TV channels. This explains the success of Netflix and the
Belgium offers of getting a huge selection of films and TV channels for around 70
euros/month.

Thus copyright infringement goes away when people have reasonable legal options:

- Do not nickel and dime your customer. 70euros/month for all the films, do not try to
charge a certain amount extra for each film and then only allowing them to watch it in 24
hours. As long as a customer pays 70 euros/month, he should be able to watch it.

- Poster child of how it should not be: go through the hassle of downloading a torrented
film. Once it is on your computer, you can start watching it after 1 second. Compare this to
inserting a DVD in the computer: 1) Due to DRM, you have difficulties to watch it under
the Linux operating system. 2) If you bought it on a travel to the US, it may be possible that
you cannot play it due to region coding. 3) If it starts playing, you have to watch for 1
minute a message about you being a criminal if you dare to copy this DVD (you bought that
DVD, thus maybe you are really not the target of that warning?). Then finally you may
watch your film. The torrent way of working clearly wins in easiness.

- In academic literature you typically buy a specialised book for around 100 euros (physical
print). Most publisher make also the book electronically available on their website.
However, they ask 30 euro per chapter, which brings you to a multiple of 100 euro if you
buy the whole book electronically. In that case it's no wonder that people resort to copyright
infringement. Sell the electronic version less than the book, or even better, sell the book
with the electronic version (book for reading, electronic version for computer search of key
words) and piracy will diminish.
