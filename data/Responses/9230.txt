Introduction

Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms,
for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content – for information, education or entertainment purposes
– regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single
Market"1the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:
on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and
to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23with a
view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative
reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical
industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was
deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The
Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have
put forward in this context and will monitor their progress.
Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working
Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated
content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges
to be a further step in making the user environment easier in
many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and
data mining – did not reach consensus among participating
stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe"
will be also taken into account in the context of the review of
the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on
Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:

"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation,
limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age;
fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while
underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright
reform".As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication

(2012)789.

Conclusions5"Providingdigital services and content across the
single market requires theestablishment of a copyright regime
for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its
on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It
is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and
facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7and "Content Online"8. These
consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a
number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality
of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality,
exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge,
and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all
stages in the value chain, including right holders,
distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green
Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by
a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent
discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and
into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital
transmissions and the segmentation of the market through
licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the
territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced
on a country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi -territorial licences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10should significantly
facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical
works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12and market-led developments such as the
on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross
-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems
are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which
they live. Not all online services are available in all Member
States and consumers face problems when trying to access such
services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same”
service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot
access the service across borders (they can only access their
“national” service, and if they try to access the "same"
service in another Member State they are redirected to the one
designated for their country of residence).

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by
right holders such as film or record

producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

14See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

7

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15to
increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

1.[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

YES- Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the
sector and the type ofcontent concerned (e.g. premium content
such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in
general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software)

The European Union is made of Member-States bound by national
borders that often overlap common languages areas, such as
Belgium that forms one country with three official languages
(French, Dutch and German). And in the north of Europe there is
a Sami population that share the same language (Sami) across
Norway, Sweden and Finland. Border zones also host minority
populations that sometimes form big communities, such as the
Danish-speaking people of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany.

These quick examples show that the problem encountered by many
people willing to access online content in Europe is not a
consumer problem but a citizen problem rooted in European
history.

One of the missions of libraries as public institutions is to
provide users with access to content in their own languages.
This was not a problem in the printing environment, but it has
become a problem in the online environment. For instance
Swedish citizens duly registered in the public library of
Helsingør (Elsinore), Denmark can borrow physical documents
(books, DVD’s, Cd’s) and go back home in Sweden and enjoy them.
This is impossible for online content (e-books, movies…). To the
detriment of users, online service provision is being hampered
by copyright rules.

2.[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
in the EU?

NO OPINION

3.  [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]

How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year
and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.

NO OPINION

15For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

It should be addressed in EU legislation the necessity to grant
new rights to libraries in the form of exceptions and
limitations to copyright in order to:

reinstate a true balance of rights between the exclusive rights
of the rights holders and other fundamental rights;

ensure that licences don’t override existing exceptions and
limitations to copyright.

5.[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

NO OPINION

6.[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service
provider:]Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

NO OPINION

7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at
EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

YES –Please explain

Market-led solutions (as discussed during the Licences for
Europe process) prove to be unable to fulfil the needs of
libraries and other cultural institutions [see EBLIDA statement
posted on 13 November 2013
athttp://www.eblida.org/news/press-release-licences-4-europe-plenary-on-13-november.html].

The copyright framework needs to be adapted to the digital era
in which the public non-commercial sector (ranging from
libraries, archives and other cultural heritage institutions)
plays a core role in giving access to information. Cross-border
access to online resources is of first importance for libraries
and cultural institutions because of the need of citizens that
are students, researchers and the general public: “As most
knowledge creation and transfer use digital means, all barriers
preventing seamless online access to digital research services
for collaboration, computing and accessing scientific
information (e-Science) and to infrastructures must also be
removed by promoting a digital ERA. The different types of
knowledge transfer, circulation and access should also be
judiciously factored into research cooperation with non-EU
countries” (Communication from the CommissionA Reinforced
European ResearchArea Partnership for Excellence and Growth,
17.07.2012, p. 13).

9

The full exploitation of digital opportunities should be
supported by a progressive and flexible approach to copyright
rules at EU level that could built up on the best existing
legal solutions.

Until now, cross-border access to online resources is either
impeded by the territoriality in licensing or based on
reciprocal agreements between institutions that don’t fall
under a clear and unified set of rules.

The differences in the implementation of the Directive
2001/29/EC, especially of the list of exceptions, create
uncertainty in the application of the law and extreme
complexity. When the EU would like to be closer to its
citizens, rules need to be easy to understand, applicable
throughout the whole territory and flexible enough to adapt to
new uses. The increased number of foreign students, as well as
the free movements of citizens across the EU should encourage
information sharing and should foster cross-border access to
content, especially the widest possible access to European
Cultural Heritage (as mentioned in the COMITÉ DES SAGES report
The New Renaissance, Report of the Reflection group on bringing
Europe’s cultural heritage online,
2011,http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/refgroup/

final_report_cds.pdf).

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.
Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the
online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17and databases18.

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders19which are essential for the
transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and
other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format)
over the internet or similar digital networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the
transmission

– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server
in view of making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g.
when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the
rights to authorise or prohibit the

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.

The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

10

dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights
are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need
to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public22. According to
this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be
licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are
“targeted” by the online service provider. A service provider
“targets” a group of customers residing in a specific country
when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

NO– Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of
clarification would berequired (e.g. as in "targeting" approach
explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23)

See answer to Q10.

9.[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a
clarification of the territorial scope of the “making
available” right have an effect on the recognition of your
rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not,
whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or
not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?

NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09
(Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is
to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and
rights related to copyright applicable to satellite
broadcasting and cable retransmission).

24Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

11

transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.[In particular if you a service provider or a right
holder:]Does the application of two rights to a single act of
economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?

YES– Please explain what type of measures would be needed in
order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

YES

Specific acts of digital reproduction made by libraries for
their services are covered by the exception 5(2)(c) of the
InfoSoc Directive (at least for documents owned by libraries).
But in the digital environment many typical library services
such as lending, inter-library loan, document supply, involve
the transmission by electronic means, which is subject to the
making available right. And, according to the prevailing
interpretation, in such cases the exception provided by art.
5(1) (temporary acts of reproduction which have no independent
economic significance), which is still an exception to the
right of reproduction, is not applicable. To solve this
problem, there should be a clear provision that allows
libraries to make available to the public reproductions
legitimately made for their services.See also answers to Q23,
Q24, Q32 and Q39.

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25in which the question has been raised
whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of
communication to the public/making available to the public
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web -page)
regularly creates temporary copies of works and other
subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been
referred to the CJEU26as to whether such copies are always
covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright, either in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?

NO– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specificcircumstances, and why (e.g. because
it does not amount to an act of communication to the public –
or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)

Hyperlink should not be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder for content legally accessible on the Internet.

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).See
also

http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

12

Two kind of hyperlinks exist. The first one consists of a
metadata element that leads to a content on another website and
the second one consists of a hyperlink that directly integrates
content in another website than where it originates from
(embedded link or framing).

The first hyperlink should not be subject to authorisation,
while the second hyperlink is not a problem of the link itself
(which is only the technical means for the appropriation (or
possibly misappropriation) of content), but a legal issue that
can be dealt with by the general rules of copyright and/or
competition right, as many court cases have already done
(mainly prohibiting framing or inline linking without source
identification).

By default, hyperlinks should not be subject to authorisation
and if necessary their use should be covered by exceptions and
limitations.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

NO– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specificcircumstances, and why (e.g. because
it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

Content legally accessible on the Internet should be considered
exempted of authorisation of the right holder by default.

The purpose of the Internet is the communication to the public.
In this situation, there shouldn’t be any request of
rightholders authorisation.

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that
tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this
principle can also be applied in the case of an act of
transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e.
where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This
raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical
application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it
– this is often referred to as

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,

the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic
implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies
of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you
have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

YES– Please explain by giving examples

Libraries are not interested in reselling, but in re-use for
cultural and scientific purposes. The problem is that any kind
of use of digital content are entirely dependent on the rules
set by the publisher, operating by licenses and technological
protection measures. Cultural content in any form of
distribution should be treated by the law for what they are -
content and not temporary services.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a
system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of
rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased
opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of
content (including older works and works that otherwise would
not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages
of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered30.

in the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works

to works originating in another country.

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a
greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed31, and identify, variously, the work itself, the
owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter.
There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and
databases. The Global Repertoire Database32should, once
operational, provide a single source of information on the
ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked
Content Coalition33was established to develop building blocks
for the expression and management of rights and licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development
of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model
for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK
Copyright Hub34is seeking to take such identification systems a
step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling
automated licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

The European Union should ensure that: (1) identifiers as well
as rights ownership and permission databases should avail open
access, based on open standards, and (2) all identifiers as
well as rights ownership and permission databases are
interoperable across all of Europe (and beyond).

Any system that is developed must be developed in a true multi
stakeholder approach (e.g not only by rights holders and
intermediaries) and should be reflective of work already
undertaken (for example by Europeana). Rights ownership and
permission databases in particular must be publicly accessible
via machine readable interfaces. They must also include the
ability to store information on out-of-copyright (Public
Domain) and openly licensed works.

As an example of good practice, see the Open Bibliographic Data
Principles,http://openbiblio.net/principles/.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35requires a
minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years
after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g.
the US).

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still
appropriate in the digital environment?

NO– Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

The term of protection expanded right after 1993 in many EU
countries from 50 to 70 years after the death of the author,
implementing an EU directive on harmonisation of the term of
protection [reference of the Directive]. The EU harmonised the
term of protection on the longer term applied by one of its
member state, Germany (70 years) although the Berne convention
only requires 50 years. 70 years is a very long time, and it
must be reduced to enable and ensure better access to
information, knowledge and culture. Very few works have a
commercial life beyond a couple of decades. Excessively long
terms of protection produce problems for many legitimate uses
of copyrighted material e.g. in the form of cumbersome or
non-existing clearance mechanisms for use. Time of protection
should not be longer than 50 years after the death of the
author. This could be a first step towards a more significant
reduction of term of protection that would require a revision
of the Berne convention.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use
for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are
established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37. In accordance with
international obligations, the EU acquis requires that
limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain
special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation
of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in
EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member
States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or
as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of
certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to
give significant flexibility to the Member

States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they
decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of
the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in
policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the
functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so
an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may
still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move
to the Member State "B")40.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most
limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright
directives are optional for the Member States?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

The purpose of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society was explicitly (as its title shows) to
create more harmonisation within the EU. Ironically, it ends in
a situation of non-harmonisation. Limitations and exceptions
vary a lot from country to country. Only one exception is
mandatory today: the exception for temporary copies (whether
this exception could/should be regarded as an act of
reproduction was also discussed at WIPO in 1996).

In addition to this situation of non harmonisation, the list of
exceptions was made exhaustive, so no exceptions could be
adjusted or expanded to similar uses, and any new exceptions
could not be added despite the fact that the world and the
information market is ever changing.

It is in the library’s missions to cooperate and share resources
across borders. For the European library community the existence
of 28 different copyright regimes with their

40Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a
novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member
States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

17

own exceptions makes this cooperation more difficult. One
example is that the definition of “non-commercial” differs from
country to country.

The lack of harmonisation and the optional character of the list
of exceptions created an ambiguous situation throughout the EU.
Especially when several Member-States work together in
cross-border projects such as:

Europeana and all the related projects whose missions are to
give online access to European Cultural Heritage;

the European Library;

the EU arctic centre, whose mission is, among others to develop
knowledge and spread information on the
regionhttp://www.arcticcentre.org/InEnglish/ABOUT-US/EU-Arctic-Information-Centreor,

the Upper Rhin University.;

All other cross-border projects shared by several member states
trying to pool resources to the benefit of their population and
to develop mutual understanding and reciprocal knowledge. All
those structures work with libraries that are supposed to give
access to their collection (including digital ones), but can be
forbidden to do so because of different copyright regimes and
absence of harmonised exceptions in the respective
member-states.

In addition, this lack of harmonisation is even more an obstacle
when projects involve non-members states of the EU.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if
so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

All exceptions should be made mandatory for all EU countries,
especially those for research and education, public-mission
institutions, and disability, because they protect fundamental
rights. There is no obvious reason to have only one mandatory
exception.

In addition it should be ensured that contracts cannot override
limitations and exceptions.

23.Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or
removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by
referring to specific cases.

See question 22. All current existing exceptions have to remain.
In addition, to address technological change that has already
occurred, the revised Directive should include: a functional
exception for the mass digitisation and making available of out
of commerce works by libraries, archives and museums for
non-commercial purposes; an exception for text and data mining;
an exception for digital lending. Moreover, a more flexible and
open legislation is needed. In particular, a “fair use”
exception, in addition to those listed in the Directives, would
ensure that the exceptions and limitations can keep pace with
technology and social changes.

We do NOT want to remove already existing exceptions, but only
add new ones and find a more flexible solution than the current
one. To list any new specific exceptions that will take into
account any new development in years to come wouldn’t prove to
be

18

useful. The list should therefore be combined with more general
principles like “fair use” or “similar use”.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES– Please explain why

It is not easy to answer this question independently from the
questions above. So we will repeat the need for a more flexible
and open solution. Most exceptions are too narrow and specific,
even for 2001 when they were written.

The exception for libraries, archives and museums 5.2.(c) is
more open in the way that it allows “specific acts of
reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for
direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage”, but it is
an exception for the reproduction right ONLY, and it does not
cover any other library activity that would be considered fair
use in a more flexible legislation. One example is that the
transmission of single scanned articles or other pieces of
information (like one single scanned poem) to individual users
or other libraries, on request, is considered as communication
to the public and therefore needs to be licensed. In the analog
world this is covered by an exception in most countries. This is
a case that in our opinion clearly would pass the three step
test, as it is a specific case and does not harm the interests
of the author.

Copyright exists in order to balance the rights of authors and
rights holders with those of users. This balance has been
damaged in the past years with only the rights holders
benefiting. The main objective of copyright reform at the
European level should be to maintain those rights and
re-establish a new balance where innovation, research as well
as legal access to digital content will be encouraged.
Therefore, Copyright law shall balance the right to access,
share and use copyrighted works with the author’s right to
protection and compensation.

Now we have a situation of imbalance, with the exhaustive list
of non-mandatory exceptions, increasing terms of protection
(the last one was for sound recordings, in 2011), cumbersome,
expensive and monopolistic licensing models for libraries for
electronic journals and books. Libraries have always been
important contributors to the revenues, especially for academic
and research publishers, and are paying for what they acquire.
More generally, a recent press release of the British Library
shows that “The economic value that the library delivers is now
almost five times its costs, representing a return on investment
of 5:1” and therefore that libraries, archives and information
services have an important role to play in boosting the
economy. A competitive market can only innovate by relying on
well-educated and informed citizens and consistent investment
in libraries, archives and information services. This generates
a good return on investment and stimulates the economy.

However there is a need to establish fair conditions applying to
libraries, archives and cultural heritage institutions as a
whole and not only to rightsholders. Rules that apply in the
commercial environment (especially for films and music) shall
apply differently in public institutions that do not seek a
direct or indirect economic interest.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the
ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by
the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a
fair-use or fair dealing provision /

19

open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the
relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as
well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal
Market.

More reliance on court decisions and case-by-case interpretation
by the Commission may be a consequence of an open norm and more
flexibility in copyright legislation. Result of Court decisions
would support better predictability of the pattern of the fair
use concept. Court cases could however be extremely costly and
should not be the only way of seeking for a solution. So, an
open ended norm reflecting the Three Step test of the Berne
convention, i.e. a Fair use exception, should be the necessary
integration of an updated list of mandatory exceptions, in
order to have, on the one hand, a copyright framework
sufficiently well-defined to avoid uncertainty and continuous
appeals to the courts, and, on the other hand, to avoid the
rigidity of an *exhaustive* list (see also answers to Questions
22, 23, 29 and 80).

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in
your experience, constitute a problem?

YES– Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are
referring to

At present, the EU only obliges EU countries to adopt one
exception (regarding temporary acts of reproduction), while the
adoption of the others is optional. As a result, something
that’s legal in one country could be illegal elsewhere.

For example, the UK is the only Member State without a private
copying exception, so an act that is legal in Spain or the
Netherland suddenly becomes a criminal offence in the UK.
Finland hardly has a parody exception, so a work considered
legal in Germany could be infringing copyright in Finland.

From a research perspective, this means that researchers have
difficulties working together and sharing knowledge across
borders. Currently, for example, inter-library loans are
hampered across borders.

Right owners and service providers based in jurisdictions with
stricter user freedoms often do not accept the wider scope of
freedoms in other jurisdictions and attempt to limit it
contractually or use technical measures.

Moreover, most licences impose the law of the state of the
publisher and not that of the subscribing institution, and this
leads to the paradox that publishers from different Member
states are not subject to national laws (including exceptions
to copyright) even if they are protected by national copyright
laws.

This, coupled with the fact that there cannot be a tender among
several competitors for the provision of copyright protected
content that can be provided just by a single company, often
makes it difficult for Libraries to obtain licences really
suitable to their needs, even when their national legislation
(copyright law, contract law, public procurement law, privacy
law, etc.) could provide solutions.

As an example, national legislations in most Member States
contain specific provisions on technical accessibility, but
they differ from each other both with reference to the
categories of beneficiaries and in terms of procedures to
benefit. Moreover, their application can be complicated by
licensing schemes and procedures. Art. 71-bis of the Italian
Copyright Law n. 633/1941 ensures that, given certain
conditions, people who have disabilities that prevent them
accessing copyright works in their original format are able to
benefit from accessible versions of these works. And art. 4 of
the Italian Law

20

n. 4/2004 on Technical accessibility points out the obligations
and duties regarding accessibility and inclusion in the case of
public procurement of IT goods and services. In particular, when
purchasing ICT goods and services, signing contracts regarding
their development and maintenance or carrying out competitive
tenders, the accessibility requirements must always be taken
into consideration.

At this point there are two different levels of obligation: on
one hand, the compliance with the accessibility requirements is
mandatory for public Web sites (and in general for Web
applications), and whenever private or public subjects draw on
public grants for the procurement of ICT equipment and tools
explicitly meant for disabled users or workers.

Public agencies must eventually provide an adequate
justification for not taking the accessibility requirements
into account or for buying a product that fails to reach
compliance.

Article 5 of the Italian Law nr.4/2004 on Technical
accessibility reminds the importance of accessibility in the
sector of education including the production of teaching tools,
courseware and electronic textbooks.

Given such legislation, licenses signed by Public bodies should
contain a provision upon which, if accessible formats are not
available, format shifting and other adaptations are permitted
when necessary to ensure technical accessibility and usability
by reading impaired authorised users. Within the limits of this
purpose, the licensor should agree to temporarily remove the
technical barriers that may prevent the adaptations needed..

But very few standard licenses contain such provision, and there
are high transaction costs in negotiating it case by case. On
the other hand, the procedure for subscribing electronic
licenses on content covered by IP exclusive rights is often a
negotiated one without a call for competition (because of the
absence of competitors), so that the contractual position of
public bodies is the weaker one.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at
national level were to have cross -border effect, how should
the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

The concept of fair compensation should include that in some
cases a fair compensation can also be no compensation. For uses
that pass the three step test, that is the case. Compensation
schemes with a legal basis should be based only on uses where
there is clear evidence that it ``harms`` the author’s economic
rights.

Compensation for “harm” done to direct author’s economic rights
should be balanced and evaluated with the public exposure
public institutions (libraries, Cultural heritage institutions,
others…) are given for free to the said author. This means that
State subsidies or grant and tax payers money provided for
supporting translation and/or publication of authors should be
considered as an authorisation by default for communication to
the public of the said translated text and/or publication by
public institutions (libraries, Cultural heritage
institutions…); moreover, publications of research results
which are mainly financed by public funds should be open
access, according to the recommendations of the European
Commission on open access.

21

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving41and enable on-site consultation of the works and
other subject matter in the collections of such institutions42.
The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works,
the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of
another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws
allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope
of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

28. (a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to
preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in
your collection?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational
establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
exception?

YES– Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of
use in question.

(a)

Print and analogue materials. The digitization for preservation
purposes carried out by publicly accessible cultural
institutions is implicitly included among the specific acts of
reproduction referred to in Article 5 (2) (c) of the Infosoc
Directive. In addition, the EU has repeatedly recommended the
adoption of national policies encouraging the digitization of
cultural heritage. However, this exception is optional and it
has been generally implemented under very narrow terms, so
that, in many member states, even format shifting for
preservation purpose is still prohibited, or limited to
specific formats (in input and/or output) as show articles
68(2) and 69(2) of the Italian Copyright law.

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

22

Digital materials fixed on support. CDs and DVDs are often
protected by technological measures (TPM). The removal of TPM
would require the cooperation of the producer. Art. 6 of the
Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection
measures are protected per se, independently on the scope of
protection, entrusting to voluntary agreements or to subsidiary
interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use
of licensed content. The strength of the protection of TPMs
compared with the weakness of the provision in favor of
legitimate uses has led in many Member States to the absence of
effective guarantee for legitimate users, including libraries.
As a result, many libraries are not able to preserve CDs and
DVDs legally acquired. These materials will become unusable due
to technological obsolescence in a few years.

Subscribed online content. In the case of online works there is
no balance at all. All the weight is on the side of the
copyright holders only. Indeed the exception provided by art. 5
(2) (c) of Directive 2001/29 does not apply because, according
to art. 6 of the Directive, it cannot provid any obligation to
the removal of TPM to the benefit of beneficiaries of
exceptions for "works or other subject-matter made available to
the public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that
members of the public may access them from a place and at a
time individually chosen by them". While the exclusive
distribution right is exhausted by the first sale in EU, so
that print materials can enter permanently into the library
collection, most content provided online are offered as
temporary services, ceasing upon the expiry of the
subscription. In such cases, library will have to pay again
every year to ensure access to those content. In many cases,
even when licenses provide for a perpetual right of access in
favor of the library and its users ((“post-termination
clause”), libraries cannot obtain back-up files for
conservation, but can only have access through the producer's
website, who does not give guarantees for long-term
preservation. Few licenses only, negotiated by libraries or
their consortia, provide for the delivery of files for local
hosting and preservation purposes. Some others contain a simple
obligation to transfer the files in case the company will not be
able to host them.

Although a single library does not have the means to ensure the
long-term digital preservation of large amounts of resources,
and the payment of an annual fee could be justified by the fact
that publishers and other commercial providers bear the costs of
storage and management of digital content on their own
platforms, Recital 16 of the Commission Recommendation of 27
October 2011, shows that the problem is that:

In spite of progress made across the EU on the preservation of
digital material, in several Member States no clear and
comprehensive policies are in place on the preservation of
digital content. The absence of such policies poses a threat to
the survival of digitised material and may also result in the
loss of material produced in digital format (born digital
material). The development of effective means of digital
preservation has far-reaching implications that go beyond
cultural institutions. Questions of digital preservation are
relevant for any private or public organisation, which is
obliged or which wishes to preserve digital material.

(http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0039:0045:EN:PDF).

Libraries play an important role in the network of cultural
institutions in charge of preserving nations’ history and
archives. They play a specific role in the literature and
information sector by receiving in legal deposit, keeping and
preserving, buying, organizing, promoting and giving access to
information books and literature as a whole.

23

Their mission is done on behalf of the general public, education
and research. Several issues are at stake now:- private
companies that license content don’t have the mission to defend
or take into account the “public interest”, “education”, or
“open access to knowledge” in their business/licence models;

Economic sustainability of private companies that license
content doesn’t offer any long term guarantee;

The evolution of format leads to a quick obsolescence that needs
public infrastructure to act outside of economic interest to
maintain national memories.

All these issues are implicit defined missions and policy goals
for many libraries, both public and academic.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Art. 5(2)(c) of the 2001/29/EC should be made mandatory. As the
'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright
and related rights in the information society' (page 301)
highlights, […]to make an exception mandatory could apply in
the case of article 5(2) c), as the development of digital
libraries is one of the key objectives of the Digital Agenda,
and the digitization of cultural heritage is promoted by the
Council and the Commission […]. Art. 6 of the 2001/29/EC
directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected
works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.

Updating the copyright framework in order that online content is
not considered a service.

Under the current terms, the copyright framework considers
online content as a (just temporary) service. This creates a
huge risk for cultural heritage institutions, much higher than
with print material, given the extreme volatility and
perishability of digital formats. It is a fact that long-term
strategies such as digital preservation and data curation are
at present largely entrusted to the market and its fluctuations
which works quasi exclusively on a very short-term .

Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
perpetual right to archive complete copies of subscribed online
materials, and to use the archived materials in the event that
access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended.
An exception should ensure, at the request of the library, the
availability of back-up files for long-term preservation,
regardless of the format of publication.

That art. 5(2) c of Directive 2001/29/EC been made mandatory and
art. 6 of Directive 2001/29/EC enforces exceptions and
limitations and ensures legitimate utilizations of protected
works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination, would
support the specific public mission and responsibility of
libraries and other cultural heritage institutions that is
different from most other users of copyrighted material.

As mentioned in our answer to question 28, their main
responsibility is to preserve, organise, make available, and
promote information and literature, whose most of the content
is still copyright protected.

That subscribed online content can escape libraries preservation
scheme because of the absence of specific exceptions creates a
huge risk of a 21st century black hole where a large amount of
content could disappear forever.

Short term economic interests shouldn’t limit long-term
preservation of human’s cultural heritage.

24

An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific
regulation for libraries to secure their public mission.

In the case some uses wouldn’t be covered by an exception, a
“fair use” approach would therefore be necessary.

30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?

See answer to question 29.

Art. 5(2)(c) of the 2001/29/EC should be made mandatory. As the
'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright
and related rights in the information society' (page 301)
highlights […]to make an exception mandatory could apply in the
case of article 5(2) c), as the development of digital libraries
is one of the key objectives of the Digital Agenda, and the
digitization of cultural heritage is promoted by the Council
and the Commission […].

Art. 6 of the 2001/29/EC directive should be revised in order to
enforce exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate
utilizations of protected works, regardless of format or mode
of dissemination.

31.  If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?

See answer to question 30.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32. (a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections
(or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
experienced specific problemswhen trying to consult, including
across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the
collections of institutions such as universities and national
libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions
in question?

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you negotiated
agreements withinstitutional users that enable those
institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their
collections, for purposes of research and private study?

Remote access to online collection of libraries covers a broad
spectrum going from digitised collection to digital-born
collection.

25

Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with
publishers, database vendors and right holders, impacting
collection development, duration of access, permitted uses..
Libraries often entrust negotiation and management of contracts
to national or regional institutional consortia to increase
their bargaining power. But the use of consortia for the
negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the
logic of large numbers may introduce rigidities in pricing and
business models, encouraging the purchase or subscription of
large packages of content (big deal) rather than the selection
of targeted works.

Currently there are gaps to be filled in the Directives (e.g. in
Infosoc and Database directives) and even more in national
copyright laws. These gaps contribute to enforce unbalanced
power relations. Unbalanced power relations among right
holders, and between right holders and users do not contribute
to establish an environment of best practices for negotiation
and contracts.

At present, licences are not satisfactory for the following
reasons:

Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting
and other adaptations should be permitted not only for
long-term preservation purposes, but also for remote access
when needed to ensure technical accessibility and usability by
print impaired people, or to effectively integrate acquired or
licensed materials in Library information systems, according to
international standards of interoperability. But the copyright
holder or the database producer can refuse both to grant a
special licence, and, in case of born-digital content, to
temporarily remove the technological protection measures in
order to facilitate the use, and often they refuse. It should
be noted that TPMs protect not only content, but also metadata
related to those content, so that the legal protection of TPMs
affects also access and reuse of metadata for integration
within library catalogues and information discovery systems.

Inter-Library Loan and Document Supply: Cooperation between
cultural institutions for the benefit of the public is
explicitly encouraged by numerous international, national and
regional standards. Interlibrary Loan and Document Supply are
typical library services based on the temporary exchange of
documents between library “A” that holds the content and
library “B” that needs it. As an internal activity between
libraries, interlibrary exchange should be totally irrelevant
for the purposes of protection of copyright. In the digital
environment, such exchange requires transmission in a network
by an intermediary (eg. an internet provider and/or a service
provider). But there is uncertainty on these points: digital
reproductions made by libraries for inter-library exchange
purposes can or cannot be considered as *specific acts* of
reproduction covered by art. 5(2)c) of the InfoSoc Directive?
According to the InfoSoc Directive (art. 5(2)c) and art. 5(1)),
a digital reproduction made by the library "A" can or cannot be
sent electronically to the library "B", provided that copy will
be used by the library "B" for legitimate uses such as
replacement of damaged parts of a volume in its collection, or
to give to an end-user a print copy within the limits of art.
5(2)b), or communication by dedicated terminals within the
(very strict) limits of art. 5(3)n), or utilization for
administrative procedures within the limits of art. 5(3)(e)? An
interlibrary electronic exchange of protected works, or parts of
them, can or cannot be considered one of those "Temporary acts
of reproduction” referred to in Article 5(1), “which are
transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of
a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable: (a)
a transmission in a network between third parties by an
intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other
subject-matter to be made, and

26

which have no independent economic significance”, and therefore
“exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article
2"?

There are different interpretations on this matter, and in most
Member States there are no explicit exceptions for interlibrary
services.

For online content subscribed to by libraries, the interlibrary
exchange is subject to licences, and only few publishers allow
such digital exchange.

Remote access to born-digital or digitized content (aka
E-Lending): see answers to Q36-38

Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most
publishers do not allow the extraction and reuse of reasonable
portions of protected works acquired or subscribed to by
libraries or other cultural institutions and their
communication to registered users through e-Learning platforms.
It is generally accepted that the exception provided by Art.
5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and
distance education, and that the fundamental rights it protects
(freedom of expression, right to be informed, right to learn)
are of crucial importance. The enforcement of this exception at
European level, prohibiting its restriction by national
legislations, or by licences is of utmost importance.

Open access to research results: see answer to Q49.

Content mining: see answer to Q49 and 53.

Post-termination access to online subscribed content: recalling
our answers to Q 28-30, most licences do not provide any
guarantee for access to subscribed content after the
termination of a licence. Such content is considered just as a
temporary service.

Academic and research libraries have negotiated licenses for
decades (even though the above mentioned problems have been
rather consistent over the years). Digital material until now
has to a large extent been focused on research and professional
information (mainly journals), reference and news, and not so
much on books and mainstream journals. Public libraries are a
kind of newcomer on this arena, due to the rapid development of
e-books for fiction and general/popular non-fiction.

Public libraries differ from academic and research libraries in
that their user base is the general public, i e anyone with a
valid library card. But, in contrast to the analog library
services, access to e-material is usually restricted to a
specific geographic area, for instance a municipality.

This shows that although the EU is encouraging cross-border
cooperation, it seems not applicable to online content hosted
by libraries because of territorial nature of copyright and/or
the grant of authorisation by rights holders.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Licences of digital content were expected to extend, not limit
opportunities for access and use through exceptions and
limitations to exclusive rights. On the contrary, exceptions
and limitations are often overridden by licences and TPMs, even
when licences are negotiated by Library consortia.

There is a need to ensure that contract/licences don´t override
existing exceptions and limitations to copyright.

27

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under which conditions?

The reform, i.e. a legislative solution, should clarify that
every kind of utilization made by libraries and cultural
institutions for their public-interest mission are allowed, no
matter the medium of the transmission.

Remote access should be allowed for all the utilizations
discussed above (see answers to Q 32).

Exceptions and limitations should apply to online content as
well as to analogue materials, and should be mandatory and
cannot be overridden by contracts or TPMs. Exceptions and
limitations should be flexible and updated to new emerging
needs, introducing a general free use provision additional to
the exceptions and limitations expressly provided, as it has
been suggested with art. 16 of the IFLA Treaty Proposal
(http://www.ifla.org/node/5858) and art. 5.5. of the European
Copyright Code drafted by the Wittem Group.

Such a general provision should allow application by analogy of
existing exceptions and limitations, provided they are
consistent with the concept of ‘fair practice’, and/or
compliant with the Three-Step-Test, which presently is recalled
by the Infosoc Directive just to limit the application of
Exceptions and Limitations.

Moreover, contracts should not override any statutory provisions
regarding the entry of a work into the public domain.

35.  If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?

NO OPINION

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

36. (a)[In particular if you are a library:]Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable
the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders,
of books or other materials held in your collection?

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
experienced specific problemswhen trying to borrow books or
other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you negotiated
agreements with librariesto enable them to lend books or other
materials electronically, including across borders?

YES– Please explain with specific examples

28

Significant barriers can be observed both for research and for
public libraries: some publishers refuse to supply their
products to libraries, or offer them at higher prices compared
to their print equivalents, or impose default selection, such
as bundling, or remove content without informing the library
and so on.

It is a significant, and in our view unacceptable, change that
the collection building policy of libraries might be decided by
publishers. This would mean that libraries would no longer be
able to guarantee free access to content, information, and
culture for European citizens.

In the UK (from the EBLIDA survey on e_books, 2012 –
unpublished, survey under review)

Public libraries purchase mainly trade books. Some trade
publishers view library availability of e-books as a direct
threat to their economic interest and are withholding titles.
Research by Shelf Free, conducted in February 2013, found that
85% of e-books aren’t available to public libraries. Out of the
top 50, most borrowed adult fiction books of 2012 only 7 were
available for public libraries to buy as e-books – and even
then it depended on which supplier the library service was
signed up to. With one supplier, only two titles were
available. (source EBLIDA e-book survey, April 2013).

From the Bookseller official top 50 ranking for eBooks in August
2013, only six were available for libraries to purchase and five
of these were from the same author and were published in 2012.

Even publishers such as Random House who do offer ebooks through
library supplier withhold the front list titles.

Titles such as Dan Brown’s Inferno are available in eAudio in UK
market, but not ebook format.

With Overdrive it should also been mentioned the loss of titles
if you don’t continue with subscription.

All these examples show the unstable environment and the
inadequacy of access to up to date literature, hence a
democracy challenge for libraries. When people who can only
afford it can access to e-books, what kind of society do we
expect to develop?

Furthermore, there are some examples that libraries also in the
digital environment boost sales of publishers.
Seehttp://paidcontent.org/2013/05/03/sourcebooks-overdrive-launch-pilot-to-demonstrate-the-impact-of-ebook-library-lending-on-sales/

29

Moreover, multiple licences + different models create lack of
clarity on the condition of access to content for users.

Deterioration of authorised users’ rights is evident (e.g.,
crossing a border with a borrowed book was not a problem. This
is impossible with an online access to a library across a
border).

Usually licenses will not in any case allow e-lending to other
libraries or patrons outside of the library’s defined
population (e. g. municipality, university, college).

If licences terms and conditions undermine the library’s
missions, and the activities established to fulfil it, then the
introduction of and transition to e-material will result in
reduced availability for library patrons.

Moreover, digital content and availability should be based on
the economy of abundance (see also Q 38). Access to digital
content offers huge potentiality to overcome physical barriers
and permits user to access to content at a time and in a place
individually chosen, without being restricted by opening hours.
In this context, also, libraries remain constraint by
acquisition budgets. Each and every library cannot afford to
acquire for themselves all that is commercially available on
the market. They rely on sharing resources with other libraries
in order to give good and adequate service to their patrons.

Quoting OECD (2012) *E-books: Developments and Policy
Consideration*,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k912zxg5svh-en,p. 8:
“[…] While e-books can help increaseaccess to information,
DRM represents a significant obstacle to lending of e-books,and
challenges the exercise of such rights by libraries which could
be considered a public interest concern in the foreseeable
future. The service must not be proprietary, and be available
for different technological platforms and devices.

The DRM generally embedded in many e-books being produced today
does not allow for the kind of free and open access provided
by, for example, public libraries. However, most e-editions in
scholarly libraries are free of DRM.

[….] Because e-books are generally made available for lending
only to registered users at a particular library, libraries may
need to purchase multiple licences rather than sharing resources
through interlibrary loans. Costs may also be affected if
territorial Digital Rights Management (DRM) restricts libraries
to purchasing geographically-specific editions of books […]”.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on the
acquisition and access to e-books by libraries highlighting
among others the following needs:

All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be
available to libraries for acquisition and access;

All e-books titles should be available to libraries at the time
of publication;

Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats, or
cooperate with libraries in making interoperable formats;

Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or
licensed e-books for a limited period of time to a user.

It should be possible to use the same e-book title
simultaneously;

30

●Authorised users should be able to download an e-book either
in the library or byway of remote access via authentication
systems.

see:http://www.eblida.org/Special%20Events/Key-principles-acquistion-eBooks-November2012/GB_English%20Version%20Key%20Principles.pdf

NB: as mentioned in the principles, a registered user is a user
who has registered with the library and whose identity is known
to the library.

Public lending right (PLR) and e-lending:

Public Lending Right applies to physical lending of books and
materials. An adaptation of the Public Lending Right should
also apply to the digital lending (e-lending) of copyright
works by EU public libraries ensuring that authors and creators
are rewarded for the use of their works.

The question referring to interlibrary loan of digital content
can be read in answer to Q32.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n°
3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.[In particular if you are an institutional user:]What
differences do you see in the management of physical and online
collections, including providing access to your subscribers?
What problems have you encountered?

There is no possible comparison between physical and online
collection in libraries. Theoretically digital collection
should be based on the economy of abundance meaning access to
an infinity of content, where budget constraint could be the
“only” limit. But in reality, libraries can buy all physical
publications, but cannot buy licences to all commercially
available content because “the rights holders are free to
decide whether they want to give access to a specific work, and
to decide on the terms for such access. The consequence of this
is that the collection building policy may be decided by the
publisher and not by the library “ (see EBLIDA. European
Libraries and the challenges of e-publishing. May 2012,
http://www.eblida.org/news/european-libraries-and-the-challenges-of-e-publishing.html).

In addition to this core issue, publishers currently develop
models with a lot of frictions that are either mere copy/paste
of physical models or unaffordable models at high costs, or
yearly subscription packages where the libraries have no
influence on the selection of publications. None of the models
pay attention to libraries public missions and needs.

Libraries should have a “right to e-lend”, which will give the
library users a “right to e-read”. An exception allowing
e-books and e-journals to be purchased and loaned for lending
virtually through remote downloads or by streaming is required.

The format and technology must not be a hindrance for access to
books.

Legal mechanisms and terms should be equivalent for analog and
digital lending.

39.[In particular if you are a right holder:]What difference do
you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as
on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such
as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and
e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

Libraries already offer a combination of on-premises
consultation of the physical collection + on-premises
consultation of certain digital collection, public lending and
remote access to (limited) online resources, etc...

31

Differences come from the opportunity offered by a 24/7 access
to digital collections that online services could deliver. With
this improvement of access, libraries could reach audiences that
until now have difficulties in coming on site during opening
times. This is an opportunity to enhance access to information
and deliver the Knowledge based society the European Union is
calling for.

The last development in libraries usages showed that the uses of
the on-premises services of libraries and other cultural
institutions such as museums increased, as well as the visitor
rate. The development of online services doesn’t contradict the
physical use of libraries and complement a range of services in
developing free access to information.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections
and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples
are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part
of the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of
historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisation and making available of out of
commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the
normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate
mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on
the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar
cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting
societies representing authors and publishers on the other44.
Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects
are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that
books that are currently to be found only in the archives of,
for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available
online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences
(granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of
the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some
Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the
licences granted)45.

40.[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or
wanting to engage in massdigitisation projects, a right holder,
a collective management organisation:]Would it benecessary in
your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of
the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries
and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that
out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

YES– Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

The term Mass digitisation (as referred to in the Orphan Works
Directive) applies to publicly accessible libraries,
educational establishments and museums, as well as by archives,
film or audio heritage institutions and public-service
broadcasting organisations.The orphan works directive contains
a restrictive clause on diligent

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars
2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres
indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,
unless the author or publisher in question opposes such
management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in
relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the
collecting society.

32

search that makes it impossible to use. The MoU on Out of
Commerce Works might have solved the Orphan Works directive
issue by addressing the issue from a broader perspective. In
addition to the fact that national laws fail to fully address
the needs of digital libraries, the MoU is severely limited by
its lack of concrete application across Europe and the lack of
implementation in National Law. It is most probable that the
question of cross-border access will be better solved by
enabling an exception for publicly funded institution for
making available content resulting of Mass digitisation process
by an extension of articles 5 (2)c and 5(3)n of the Infosoc
directive. Actually in Norway, the mass digitization carried
out by the national library, is an exception warranted in
5(2)c. And the making available through a license (ECL) is in
fact an extension of the Norwegian implementation of 5(2)c”

Solutions exist, such as Extended Collective Licensing that
might be useful when it comes to make available content online
for projects resulting from Mass digitisation, as stated in the
report available at
:http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf.

41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those
already agreed for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or
audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

YES– Please explain

The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing for mass
digitization of out of print works. The mechanism should
regulate right clearance in line with the guidelines provided
for in the Out of Commerce MoU.

Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46enables Member States to implement in
their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the
purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or
full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing
copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the
classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board
without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders.
The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for
rather different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to
Member State, with several Member States providing instead a
framework for the licensing of content for certain educational
uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better
possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42. (a)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

YES– Please explain

School and university libraries are resource centres for both
students and teachers. Collections are also built to provide
teachers with wide spectre of pedagogical material

to be used and shared in the classroom and also more and more
for distant learning. However, not all member countries have
implemented the exception 5(3)(a) for illustration for teaching
purposes, and those that have, usually have much more limited
exceptions than the article in the directive allows for . It is
actually a quite open exception. But since the implementation
differs a lot between countries, what is permitted in one
country is not allowed across the border. Universities ,
especially those located next to a national border (such as
Lille (France) or Antwerpen (Belgium), having developed
high-level specialisation and attractive student curricula
usually needs teaching material to be as widely available as
possible since they attract students from all over Europe.

The development of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) challenges
the way exceptions for teaching have been implemented and
request a shift towards a by default exception for teaching.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Most licences do not allow the extraction and reuse of
reasonable portions of licensed materials and their
communication to Authorized Users through e-Learning platforms.
It is generally accepted that the exception provided by Art.
5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and
distance education, and that the fundamental rights it protects
(freedom of expression, right to be informed) are of crucial
importance, it is of particular importance the enforcement of
this exception at European level, prohibiting its restriction
by national legislations, or by licences.

Licenses for electronic journals are usually very restrictive
when it comes to serving users outside of the institution, even
electronic transmission of single articles in pdf-format to
external individual users or other libraries. It can however be
printed and sent by regular mail, which seems rather odd these
days. University and college libraries usually manage the
licenses as a continuation of their earlier mission of
providing necessary literature and information for students and
teachers.

As the Hargreaves report notes: Many university academics –
along with teachers elsewhere in the education sector – are
uncertain what copyright permits for themselves and their
students. Administrators spend substantial sums of public money
to entitle academics and research students to access works which
have often been produced at public expense by academics and
research students in the first place. (…) Senior figures and
institutions in the university sector have told the Review of
the urgent need reform copyright to realise opportunities, and
to make it clear what researchers and educators are allowed to
do. (Hargreaves,2011, p.41). This highlights the need of legal
certainty. A broad exception for education mandatory (as all
the other exceptions) would be first part of the solution.

The rule stating that licenses override copyright must be
changed and turned the other way around, so that exceptions
override the license terms if the licenses do not comply with
exceptions in the copyright law.

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the
use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How
successful are they?

The legislation varies a great deal from country to country. The
Nordic countries use the ECL mechanism for copying
(reproduction) of material for course packs, handouts and

34

the like. Some countries have an exception for performance of
works in an educational context, as long as it does not include
any act of reproduction.

The mechanism of ECL is not supported by all member countries,
and also it is important not to introduce licenses where an
exception should be in place. The article 5(3)(a) is quite open
and could already allow for much broader exceptions than those
implemented in the different member states. Therefore a broad
mandatory exception for education that covers all kinds of
works, in whatever format, is needed to support the important
purpose of teaching.

45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered and under what conditions?

The mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all
types of works for illustration of teaching. It shall not be
limited to any types of institution but rather defined by its
purpose: teaching.

46.  If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?

There shouldn’t be any different solution.

Research

Directive 2001/29/EC47enables Member States to choose whether to
implement in their national laws a limitation for the purpose of
non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations
at Member States level.

47. (a)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use works or other subject matter in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

(b)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

Art. 5(3)(a) covers both rights of reproduction and
communication to the public and refrains from imposing
limitations as regards the extent and the nature of the works
used.

Nevertheless, Member States have implemented this exception in
terms that are much narrower, so that in the new technological
environment, where forms of collective creation are possible
and information explosion is everyday reality in any
discipline, the difficulty to access and share content in order
to provide content-derived knowledge and/or added-value services
is subject to new barriers, formed by legislation, licences, and
technological protection measures. Actually, apart from the cost
of licences - which are unaffordable for many - the most
frequent difficulties relate to the following uses:

47Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

35

a. the open access deposit of "publications resulting from
publicly funded research as soon as possible, preferably
immediately and in any case no later than six months after

the date of publication, and twelve months for social sciences
and humanities", as required by the Commission Recommendation
of 17.7.2012 on access to and preservation of

scientific information;

the re-use and production of derivative works;

the reproduction of works or parts of works for personal study,
through library or inter-library e-lending;

the exchange of articles or book chapters;

the access of alumni to digital subscriptions of an academic
institution;

the content mining.

Scientific and research authors are different from those of the
creative industries in their motivation, status and interests.
They do not make their own living as writers with

the remuneration they receive from copyright fees, but as
tenured teachers and in the progress they make in their
academic carrier. Moreover, provided they are quoted, they

encourage re-use of their work. Legislation should reflect the
distinctive needs of scientific and research community. For
example, a partial retention of the rights for

non-commercial purposes should be given to the public when the
work is the output of publicly funded researchs. In this
respect: a. publicly funded bodies should be obliged

to ensure open access to results of publicly funded researchs,
within a reasonable period after their publication; b. the
position of authors needs to be strengthened by

prohibiting any agreement with publishers intended to prevent or
circumvent the deposit of works in open access repositories.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use
of content for research purposes?How successful are they?

Find below positions on Open access and content mining as
highlighted in Question 32:

Open access to research results: The Commission Recommendation
of 17 July 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific
information, promotes the adoption by Member States of policies
that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded
research, in online, open and free electronic infrastructures,
which should be interoperable within and outside the EU and
suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are
often responsible of their parent institutional open access
repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the open access
availability of articles and other publications which are the
result of publicly

36

financed research, no later than six months after their
publication. Some publishers allow this practice to all their
authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There
should be a legal instrument enforcing – on one side - the
right of authors in making their papers available to the public
for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side
- the right of libraries or their parent institutions in
collecting and making openly and publicly available such
content.

Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for
scientific research is enormous, and has been widely
demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g.,
the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not
creative expressions. Libraries are interested in such
utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their
catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of
their users. Undertaking text and data mining of content to
which researchers have already lawful access (i.e. when a
lawful user is recognized as such by a voluntary licence
(provided by the copyright holder) OR a legal licence
(exception provided by law). See recitals 34,49,50,51 of the
Preamble of the Directive 96/9/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases) should be considered a legitimate utilization, and
should not be subject to re-license. But there is not legal
certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not
allow content mining. As a consequence, in most cases
researchers give up research, rather than addressing high
transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and
indirect (the time needed to negotiate). For this, an exception
should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on
which researchers have lawful access, irrespective of whether
this is text and data mining for commercial or non-commercial
purposes.

Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC48provides for an exception/limitation for
the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international
level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility
of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities
(notably by increasing the number of works published in special
formats and facilitating their distribution across the European
Union)49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50has been adopted to facilitate access to
published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired,
or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind
to produce, distribute and make available accessible format
copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation
of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started
work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the
adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across
borders).

YES– Please explain by giving examples

Article 5(3)b of Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception
for the benefit of people with a disability. With regard to
cross-border sharing of adapted materials produced under this
exception there has been greater progress in sharing accessible
formats between countries with common languages such as German
(Germany, Austria, Belgium), French (France, Belgium) and Dutch
(Netherlands, Belgium) than elsewhere.

Despite the existence of the European Network of Trusted
Intermediaries, (ETIN), certain copyright issues have proved to
be a barrier to rightholders agreeing to sign up to ETIN
cross-border licences. The most striking example of the
difference in the scope of what is lawfully defined as being
print disabled can be found in the German situation.

Under German copyright law the disability exception is
restricted to those who cannot read print for sensory reasons,
and this excludes circulation of these copies among persons
with dyslexia. In Austria this is not the case, meaning that a
copy made under the German disability exception could legally
be distributed among a wider group of beneficiaries in Austria
than in Germany itself. Rightholders claim that this cannot be
done, because such use was never included when permission was
granted to produce the adapted copy. Also German Trusted
Intermediaries (TI’s) cannot and will not carry the
responsibility for the use of the adapted copies they export to
other TI’s in different Member States, nor make a distinction
how to distribute the adapted copies they have imported. To
quote Elke Dittmer, president of Medibus (the German
distributor of all adapted copies made in Germany): “Within
ETIN it means that all accessible books made in Germany are
only for blind and visually impaired users in other countries.
Those libraries (abroad) who are serving also other print
disabled user can’t distribute our books to them. That means
that they have to classify the book which can be lend out to
which category of disabled persons. And I have no idea how to
communicate this to a dyslexic person in Denmark that
accessible books from Netherlands are for him but not the
German ones. If we would join ETIN our colleagues in other
countries will face problems with different groups of disabled
people and maybe this is also a legal problem because it could
be a discrimination to some people.”

Differences in national copyright laws, and differences in
implementing and servicing the beneficiaries in the various
Member States need to be overcome. This should be possible with
a mandatory exception for print disabled people. ETIN has proved
to be inefficient and soft law will not solve the problem.

38

The problem exists at national levels as well with the import of
textbooks, especially from the US and the UK, for the supply to
print disabled students in high schools and universities. Many
of these schools teach courses in English and the adapted
versions are available mainly in the US, but are not allowed to
leave the country. ETIN is no solution for access to US books.

The emergence of eBooks additionally offers rightholders the
option to make versions under the disability exception easily
accessible for print disabled people through synthetic speech
output. Given their poor record with regard to printed works,
there is no evidence that publishers will make eBooks
accessible in this way, continuing to deny access to books to
many disabled people.

51.  If there are problems, what could be done to improve
accessibility?

On cross border sharing:

There is a need of a single harmonised definition of
print-disabled people based on the UN Convention on Human
Rights and the Marrakesh VIP Treaty 2013 and for mandatory
copyright exceptions for disabled people.

For print disabled people, it is not possible to discriminate
between types of handicap.

Accessibility should be equitable to normal reading: that means:
an accessible version can be searched for, found and read in a
way that is equitable to what sighted people can do, known as
the ‘ecosystem of reading’. The availability of a simple
unstructured and unsynchronised commercially produced audiobook
is not enough to justify the label “accessible” for
print-disabled people. Sighted people can flip through their
book, browse websites, order books, use eReaders, search within
eBooks, etc. All these functions must also be available to
print-disabled readers as well. A clear definition of
accessibility is therefore needed.

While non-legislative solutions to create a better flow of
accessible copies across borders may be worked upon meanwhile,
these will be patchy and insecure and it is clear that for too
long the necessary goodwill to find the right solution to end
the book famine for disabled people has been lacking This is
why the Marrakesh VIP treaty was adopted. As has been proven in
other areas of equal rights, it is important to have a proper
legislative copyright framework for disabled people, one that
implements the Marrakesh VIP Treaty, which the EU and all its
Member States should sign immediately and implement and ratify
urgently.

52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate
accessibility to content? How successful are they?

In some countries, (such as the Netherlands) good cooperation
exists between the producers of accessible copies (Dedicon) and
rightholders through their national association NUV.

However, reselling the adapted accessible copy back to original
owner/publisher hardly ever happens. In the future this might
be a workable model however. That all depends if and to what
extent the file formats for eBooks and those for accessible
versions such as Daisy will be truly integrated and embraced by
the marketplace. For the time being, the two are not fully
integrated. Dedicon could however upgrade/convert the
publisher’s digital file, not only to make Braille and other
versions, but to enrich eBooks with

39

certain navigation markers, or media overlays to make it more
attractive for the publisher to put on the market. The
collaboration between the Daisy Consortium and the
International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) on the ePub3
standard is an excellent facilitator for that.

However, the Netherlands are front runners in this area and
their situation is not repeated throughout Europe. Market
driven solutions cannot provide fair and equitable outcomes all
over Europe. The abolition of discrimination and the creation of
access to information for print-disabled people, equal to that
enjoyed by the general public, requires legislation - not
solely market-driven solutions based on licensing, since the
latter have failed. This market failure, in addition to the
copyright restrictions that deny print-disabled people access
to accessible formats, causing the book famine that disabled
people have endured for too long in Europe, remain important
factors that implementation and ratification of Marrakesh will
go a long way to address.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51are
different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.) . Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation
from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the
context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no
additional licences should be required to mine material to which
access has been provided through a subscription agreement and
considered that

For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data
mining” will be used.

more content online”:

a specific exception for text and data mining should be
introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between
commercial and non-commercial.

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you experienced

in relation to copyright protected content, including across
borders?

YES– Please explain

The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is
enormous, and has been widely demonstrated (See JISC (2012), The
value and benefits of text
mining,http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/reports/2012/value-text-mining.pdf),see
also key resources below. It is a process aimed to collect raw
data (e.g.,the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a
database), not creative expressions. Undertaking text and data
mining of content to which researchers have already lawful
access should be considered a legitimate utilization, and
should not be subject to re-license. But there is not legal
certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not
allow content mining. As a consequence, in most cases
researchers give up research, rather than addressing high
transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and
indirect (the time needed to negotiate). For this, an exception
should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on
which researchers have lawful access.

Since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the
content in order for a machine to extract facts and data for
mining, the act of text and data mining is precluded under
copyright law in Europe. Because it prevents the copying of
large portions of databases, the Database Directive is also a
legal barrier to text and data mining. Technical protection
measures (also protected under law), preventing the downloading
of large amounts of content, are also preventing the application
of text and data mining techniques. Although text and data
mining is concerned with the extraction of facts and data, the
results of text and data mining research are currently being
suppressed because of a lack of legal clarity.

Even if content is openly available on the Web, without explicit
permission indicating otherwise, it is unclear if the copying of
this content for the purpose of text and data mining is legal.
Content licensed under open access licences such as cc-by-sa or
cc-by-nc may be inadvertently preventing users from mining the
content.

Text and data mining is concerned with the extraction of facts
and data , which are not covered by copyright

Text and data mining may infringe copyright because it is
necessary to make copies of content to convert it into machine
readable format

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and
data mining on content on which researchers have lawful access.

Researchers must be able to share the results of text and data
mining, as long as these results are not substitutable for the
original copyright work - irrespective of copyright law,
database law or contractual terms to the contrary. A specific
exception to this effect allowing the copying of content for
the purpose of text and data mining is necessary.

Such an exception should not distinguish between commercial and
non-commercial purposes as, for research institutions, this
would prevent knowledge transfer.

An exception for text and data mining would provide legal
certainty;

TPMs and contracts should not override such an exception;

Differentiating between commercial and non-commercial activity
is not in the public interest.

55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities should be covered
and under what conditions?

A legislative solution should take the form of an exception
which allows the copying of content and the circumvention of
TPMs for text and data mining purposes.This exception must not
be over-ridable by contracts.

If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would
it be?

Licencing will not work as an alternative solution. The
negotiation of licences is resource intensive and unscalable.
Nor will licences addresses the current ambiguity around the
mining of the open Web.

57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that
constitute barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

For data in databases not owned by libraries or universities a
license agreement is needed . In that situation, TDM becomes a
property right and a security issue.

Even for the use of databases owned by libraries and
universities security can become a major issue.

42

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-
generated content”. While users can create totally original
content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the
Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53. User-generated content
(UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not
necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content
with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not
“new” as such. However, the development of social networking
and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54.

IV.  Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on
goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store
multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and
her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by

55Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

44

rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service
provider already covers copies made by the end user. This
approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’
licence fees5657.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography
exceptions58in the digital environment?

NO OPINION

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes
in the context of a service that has been licensed by
rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal,
be subject to private copying levies?59

NO– Please explain

When content has been already licensed, users should not be
subject to payment for uses that are compliant with the
licence’s terms.

Registered Users of Library collections are benefitting of the
existence of the exception for private copying. This exception
should cover all kinds of protected works.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application
to online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing
allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

NO OPINION

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the
invoices for products subject to levies?60

YES– Please explain

It is necessary for transparency and the user’s right to be
informed.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying

Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António
Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on
the following

levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom
the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or
business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue
payments61.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border
transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate
payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to
persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly
unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example
you provide (type of products, type of transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).

NO OPINION

70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do
they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex
post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help
to remedy the situation?

NO OPINION

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current
functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best
be solved?

Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to
producers62or determining who the owner of the rights is when
the work or other subject matter is created in the context of
an employment contract63. This is an area that has been
traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are
significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial
differences also exist between different sectors of the
creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain.Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies.

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack
of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of
the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

72.[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the
best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that
you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of
your works and performances?

NO OPINION

73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to
prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

YES.

Contract between authors and publishers (by extension Rights
holders) benefiting from public grant for the publication of a
work should contain a clause clearly authorising the sale of
the said work in any format (analogue and digital) to publicly
funded libraries for communication to the public, lending and
e-lending (i.e. remote online access to content). This would
apply specifically for academic and research publications
resulting from publicly funded research, but also for fiction
and popular non-fiction where publication has been supported
with public money.

74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,
what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you
identify?

NO OPINION

VI.  Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE64provides for a harmonised framework for
the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights,
including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as
to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a
proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with
the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital
content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and
the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right
for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be
contested that enforcement measures should always be available
in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be
proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this
could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP
infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be
clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and
data protection for private users.

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

You will find more information on the following website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

47

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered
more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough
to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

Limitation of ISPs liability is important. Otherwise there is a
risk of reducing freedom of expression and freedom of
communication. Private enforcement is unacceptable, regular
legal processes must be followed.

The general term “intermediary” is not very precise and can
create uncertainty as to who is an intermediary. Libraries
shall not be considered intermediaries in this context, or any
legislation should seek to make clear when libraries and
educational establishments are in or out of scope. We certainly
believe that if any obligations are put on intermediaries as has
been the case with Three Strikes Legislation, that libraries /
educational establishments should be given a safe harbour in
law.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

NO– Please explain

VII.A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been
present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only manner in which a truly Single Market for content
protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe
that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing
a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU
Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent
framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
as well as a single framework for enforcement?

NO

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright
in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

The next (urgent) step should be the enlargement and enforcement
of exceptions and limitations, but such process could lead to a
broader copyright reform.

48

The current level of differences among Member State Legislation
can be compared to the current differences among Member State
social system, or standard of living that cannot be fixed by a
regulation.

Sorting out the current impediments due to the inadequacy of the
system means to rethink the framework on long-term (such as the
Wittem Project suggest) while acting now to enact progressive
solutions (see answer to Q80).

VIII.  Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive
consultation on the most important matters relating to the
current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could
bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed
in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU
legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how
such matters should be addressed.

Copyright law reform at the European level is absolutely
necessary to simplify the current complicated regime and the
overlapping of different directives. Licensing initiatives
alone will not achieve this.

Meanwhile, the EU should develop mechanisms to ensure that
licence clauses cannot override existing exceptions and
limitations. During the previous Licences for Europe dialogue,
it has never been made possible to discuss this issue, hence
the need of urgent decision on that point. For the same reason,
the removal of technological protection measures should be made
compulsory for all legitimate uses.

Compulsory Licenses for Libraries

The exclusive rights that exist in regards to published works
should not include the right of refusal to sell to libraries,
or to limit their services, both in physical and digital
environment.

Commercial licences for libraries should include the
utilizations presently permitted by Infosoc and Database
Directives.

In all cases, the use of the acquired materials should be
allowed for the following purposes:

Research. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff and
affiliates together with its Authorized Users should, from a
place and at a time individually chosen by them, be able to
search, retrieve, and display the licensed materials, print or
download and save individual chapters, articles or items of the
licensed materials without legal or technological impediment.
Moreover, they should be able to use data and text mining
technologies to derive information from the licensed materials
for computational analysis and other research purposes.

Education and Teaching. The Library and its Authorized Users
should be able to extract or use information contained in
licensed materials for educational, scientific, or research
purposes, including extraction and manipulation of information
or images for the purpose of illustration, explanation,
comment, criticism, teaching, research, or analysis. The
Library and/or its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates
should be able to use a reasonable portion of licensed
materials in the course of instruction and communicate same
material to Authorized Users at a place and time convenient to
them.

49

Scholarly Sharing. Authorized Users should be able to transmit
to a third party colleague in hard copy or electronically,
insubstantial amounts of the licensed materials for personal,
scholarly, educational, scientific, or research uses.
Authorized Users should be able to use, with appropriate
credit, figures, tables and brief excerpts from the Licensed
Materials in the Authorized User’s own scientific, scholarly
and educational works. When an Authorized User is the Author of
an article which is part of the licensed materials, and which is
the result of a publicly funded research, he/she or the Library
staff should be able to put such work, with appropriate credit
to the Publisher, in an Open Access repository after a
reasonable time from the date of its publication.

Interlibrary Loan. Licensee’s staff should be able to provide to
other libraries or cultural institutions whether by post or fax,
or secure electronic transmission, whereby the electronic file
is deleted immediately after printing, for the purposes of
research or private study and not for Commercial Use, a single
copy of articles, chapters, or other individual documents from
licensed materials.

Technical Accessibility, usability and interoperability. Format
shifting and other adaptations should be permitted for
long-term preservation purposes, or to ensure technical
accessibility and usability by visually impaired Authorized
users, or to effectively integrate Licensed Materials in
Library information systems, according to international
standards of interoperability. Within the limits of these
purposes, the Licensor should agree to temporarily remove the
technical barriers that may prevent adaptations.

Administrative and Judicial Proceedings. The Library, its parent
Institution’s staff, affiliates and authorized users should be
able to transmit and/or upload individual articles to secure
electronic systems for judicial and administrative use,
including any national research quality assessment (such as RAE
in UK or VQR in Italy) and the selection procedures for academic
and professional careers.

Archival Availability. The Library should be granted a
nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to use any licensed
materials accessed during the License term. The Licensor should
permit the Library to archive one complete copy of the Licensed
Materials, and permit use of the archived materials in the event
that access is discontinued or suspended. Such use should be in
accordance with the provisions of the agreement, which
provisions shall survive any termination of it, provided that
the contractual terms of the License agreement will not
override any statutory provisions regarding the entry of the
work into the public domain. This means that the archival copy
should be free after the termination of copyright terms, when
it enters in the public domain. It should be prevented the
revival of exclusive "sui generis" rights.. Once a work is
out-of-commerce in its all versions, Library should be entitled
to give unrestricted access to licensed materials.

Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR. Amsterdam,

o Page 10: “The current lack of flexibility in copyright law
undermines the very fundamental freedoms, societal interests
and economic goals that copyright law traditionally aims to
protect and advance. This is the case particularly in the area
of limitations and exceptions – an area where more than
elsewhere in the law of copyright rules have become detailed,
rigid and connected to specific states of technology. Examples
abound. Whereas social media have in recent times become an
essential

50

means of social and cultural communication, current copyright
law leaves little or no room for sharing ‘user-generated
content’ that builds upon pre-existing works. By the same
token, current limitations and exceptions rarely take into
consideration current educational and scholarly practices, such
as the use of copyright protected content in Powerpoint
presentations, in ‘digital classrooms’, on university websites
or in scholarly e-mail correspondence. Existing limitations and
exceptions in many Member States’ copyright laws also find it
hard to accommodate such essential information tools as search
engines. By impeding these and other uses that should arguably
remain outside the reach of copyright protection, the law’s
overly rigorous structure impedes not only cultural, social and
economic progress, but also undermines the social legitimacy of
copyright law proper.”

o Page 17: “The EU acquis, in other words, contains
flexibilities that may be invisible at the national level
because of an overly cautious and restrictive implementation.”

o Page 29: “There appear to be good reasons and ample
opportunity to (re)introduce a measure of flexibility in the
national copyright systems of Europe. The need for having more
openness in copyright law is almost self-evident in this
‘information society’ of highly dynamic and unpredictable
change. A historic perspective also suggests that, due to a
variety of circumstances, copyright law, particularly in the
civil law jurisdictions of Europe, has lost much of its
flexibility in the course of the past century. In other words,
making copyright law in author’s rights regimes more flexible
would not go against the grain of legal tradition. (…) We would
therefore recommend to introduce a measure of flexibility
alongside the existing structure of well-defined limitations
and exceptions, and thus combine the advantages of legal
security and technological neutrality.”

To conclude, we would like to ensure that any Copyright review
will not lead to an EU regulation that would be based on
minimum standards and would be less progressive than the
current regime. A comparative study of the current 28 copyright
regimes identifying the most up-to-date and progressive
solutions developed in Member-States could be a good work in
parallel to this consultation. Identifying where citizens and
public institutions’ rights benefitted the most would open up
new legislative opportunities and would support the need of
social harmonisation.
