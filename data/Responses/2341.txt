   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


█ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


Our  members  have  experienced  difficulties   in   trying   to   negotiate
collective/consortia agreements for access to  online  information  services
(eg.  legal/news  databases)  on  behalf  of   library/information   sharing
networks, and in attempting  to  centrally  manage  access  to  subscription
sources for users based  in  a  number  of  different  EU  States.  Imposing
territorial restrictions on access  to  content  is  contrary  to  a  common
European market in which all EU citizens should  have  access  to  the  same
resources and services.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


EU law should be harmonised to embrace  the  modern  digital  world  and  to
facilitate collective cross-border  management  of  licensing.  The  current
regime is fragmented, costly, lacking  in  accountability  and  inconsistent
with an open market approach.


   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


█ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


█ YES – Please explain


Legislative measures are need at EU level to ensure  consistency  in  rights
and  protections  across  all  Member  States,  while   maintaining   enough
flexibility for Member States to exercise discretion  in  copyright  law  at
national level as appropriate, to take account of individual circumstances.


 € NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

█ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

There is considerable uncertainty regarding  the  scope  of  this  provision
when making works available to cross-border audiences in the  EU.  Expanding
the “country of origin” approach to  cover  all  works  would  help  provide
clarification. An exception should also be introduced to provide for  access
to works held in  digital  format  in  libraries  and  archives  which  were
previously made available to the public.

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


█ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


Hyperlinks are central to the functionality and interactive  nature  of  the
Internet, and linking should not infringe copyright unless the  provider  of
a link knowingly connects to an  infringing  copy.  Restricting  linking  of
material that  is  otherwise  lawfully  available  will  restrict  research,
learning and innovation.


€ NO OPINION




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

█ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)

reproduction which is temporary, transient, and  an  integral  part  of  the
technological process of viewing information via the Internet.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€   YES


█  NO


€ NO OPINION


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


A compulsory registration system could make it easier to identify which
works are protected by copyright and who to approach for permission to use
them.  It could also resolve issues relating to orphan works. However,
while it may be attractive to seek any system to make it easier to trace
the copyright status of a work and gain clearance, the disadvantages would
undermine any potential advantages.


  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


A system of registration would fundamentally change the nature of  copyright
law in a way that would favour large commercially owned entities  but  would
exclude the vast majority of the population, in  particular  those  creating
works without an original commercial objective.


A registration system is currently precluded by Article 5(2)  of  the  Berne
Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Literary  and  Artistic   Works,   and
implementing one could involve a significant administrative  burden.  Unless
kept up to date it wouldn’t provide information on the date of death  of  an
author and the subsequent history of their estate. A voluntary system  could
create additional complexities and potentially lead  to  inconsistencies  in
rights and protections.


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


It has been suggested that registered copyright holders could be given
preferential or exclusive access to the courts in the case of disputes, or
that the length of the copyright term could be extended for registered
rights holders. However, we feel that this would create an unfair bias and
inequalities in access to justice. Anything that would disadvantage those
that have not registered would deprive them of their fundamental rights.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


The EU should ensure that the identifiers and databases are as
comprehensive and inclusive as possible, based on open standards, and
freely available to all stakeholders. They should also include the ability
to store information on works in the public domain.





Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


█ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


The term of copyright protection should be shorter to bring it into line
with international norms (life of the creator plus 50 years). An extended
period merely benefits the estate, not the creator.


€ NO OPINION


 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

█ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


This creates inconsistencies and an uneven  playing  field  across  the  EU.
Differences in the exceptions in  national  copyright  law  are  undermining
effective collaboration and knowledge  sharing  between  EU  Member  States.
Rights holders benefit from harmonised protection and enforcement  measures,
but the same standardisation of rights does  not  apply  for  libraries  and
their users. European citizens should have the same rights regarding  access
to information and culture regardless of which country they live in.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

█ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


All exceptions included in the EU Copyright Directives should  be  mandatory
in all Member  States,  as  these  were  only  brought  in  after  carefully
balancing the considerations of rights holders, end  users  and  the  common
good. For example there is currently no exemption  for  format  shifting  in
Irish legislation, although  most  people  consider  it  an  entitlement  to
convert music they have bought from CD to MP3 format.


€ NO – Please explain

€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]

No exceptions should be removed and all should be mandatory across  the  EU.
There should be new exceptions allowing text and data mining, remote  access
to digital  content  and  e-lending  by  libraries,  and  for  research  and
education. The critical role that libraries play  in  the  preservation  and
dissemination of cultural  heritage,  in  educating  users  about  copyright
issues, and in serving as an intermediary between users and  rights  holders
should be recognised.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

█ YES – Please explain why


Copyright law in the EU has not kept up with technological developments  due
to the fact that the exceptions list is both exhaustive  and  optional.  The
current system is out of date and fails to address the dramatic  changes  in
ICT that have taken place in the recent years. A fair  use  provision  would
provide the flexibility  to  accommodate  new  technologies  and  allow  for
innovative ways of creating and transforming works.


€ NO – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

A broad “fair use” type exception to supplement  specific  exceptions  would
provide flexibility and help keep up with technological  advances.  An  open
norm approach would allow the courts  to  determine  the  permissibility  of
exceptions and limitations based on precedent. This could be  combined  with
a system of  mandatory  and  non-exhaustive  exceptions.  This  would  avoid
having to adapt the list to take account  of  new  developments,  and  would
encourage creative re-use and the development of new  business  models.  One
disadvantage of an exclusively open norm system is lack of  legal  certainty
and reliance on court decisions to define what is permissible.

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

█ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


There are variations in what is legal from one EU country  to  another.  For
example, the full range of exceptions permitted by EU law are not  currently
provided for in  Irish  legislation,  including  those  related  to  format-
shifting, parody, education, disability, and heritage.


€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

█ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.


Under Irish law, heritage institutions including  libraries,   archives  and
museums are currently not permitted to format shift works  for  archival  or
preservation  purposes,  or  to  make  copies  of  images  or  extracts  for
publication in a catalogue.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

This could be addressed by broadening the scope of the exception in  article
5(2)(c) of the EU Copyright Directive, and by making  the  incorporation  of
exceptions mandatory in all EU Member States.

  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

Broadening article 5(2)(c) would allow institutions to reproduce  all  works
in their collections provided this is not for commercial  gain.  This  would
include adequate provisions for making  back-up  copies,  reproductions  for
the purpose of format shifting, and digitisation projects.

  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

Heritage institutions often encounter issues in attempting to provide
online access to their collections for research and study purposes.
Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers
and database vendors which impact upon collection development, and often
these prevent cross border access to digital content for research and
study. Heritage institutions should be permitted to provide online access
to works in their collections on a non-commercial basis. Restricting
institutions to making works available on dedicated terminals onsite is far
too limiting and not in line with technological developments and the
expectations of citizens in modern society.


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

By broadening the scope of the existing exception in article 5(3)n of the
Copyright Directive to allow heritage institutions to make out-of-commerce
works in their collections available on-line for scientific and educational
purposes without restriction to on-site terminals.

Also, an EU-wide provision should be introduced permitting publicly funded
research to be made available to the public in an open access online
repository within a specific period of time following original publication
(as is the case in Germany).

  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]


The main element would be  broadening  the  existing  exception  in  article
5(3)n of Directive 2001/29/EC to allow works to  be  made  available  online
via public networks including the Internet. Under this approach  the  online
activities of cultural heritage institutions would be governed  by  targeted
exceptions covering the  making  of  reproductions,  making  out-of-commerce
works available online, and e-lending. The scope  of  the  exception  should
further be expanded to not only include ‘the purpose of research or  private
study’ by ‘individual members of the public’ but should apply  to  all  non-
commercial uses. A  clause  allowing  rights  holders  to  opt  out  of  the
exception could be included to balance their interests with those of users.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

█ YES – Please explain with specific examples


Libraries are faced with numerous  problems  when  attempting  to  negotiate
agreements for electronic lending, including the refusal  of  publishers  to
sell e-books to libraries, removal of content without notice, and  the  need
for  multiple  licences  and  licensing  models.   There   is   considerable
uncertainty regarding the status of e-lending under EU law, and  restrictive
licensing conditions are impeding cross border access  to  libraries.   This
needs to be resolved in order to ensure that user rights are  maintained  in
the digital age.


 € NO


€ NO OPINION


  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

The best solution would be to  introduce  a  right  for  libraries  to  lend
digital media by including a new specific exception in EU  law.  This  would
create legal certainty and avoid ambiguity. The exception should  cover  all
e-books whether commercially available or not, and the following  principles
should be applied across the EU:

- All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be available  to
libraries for acquisition and access
- All e-books titles should  be  available  to  libraries  at  the  time  of
publication
 -Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats
- Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired  or  licensed  e-
books for a limited period of time to a user
-Registered users should be  able  to  download  an  e-book  either  in  the
library or by way of remote access via authentication systems.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

There are many differences between the management  of  physical  and  online
collections, and heritage institutions need to  take  a  range  of  criteria
into account when selecting one form over another,  including  relevance  to
user needs, anticipated level of use, scope and content, quality,  currency,
licensing  issues,  budgetary  constraints,  accessibility,  ease  of   use,
archival issues and whether  there  is  a  particular  requirement  for  one
format over another, for example hard copy  for  court  purposes  or  online
access  to  facilitate  geographical  diversity.  Complex  and   restrictive
licensing  requirements  often  create  difficulties  in   managing   online
collections. The potential  for  heritage  institutions  to  provide  online
access  to  their  collections  is  currently   impeded   by   unnecessarily
restrictive copyright rules, in which  permission  from  rights  holders  is
required to make protected works available online. This makes  no  sense  in
situations where the majority of works held by these  institutions  are  not
even commercially available.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


█ NO – Please explain


From the  perspective  of  heritage  institutions  the  2011  Memorandum  of
Understanding does not adequately address the scope  of  mass  digitisation,
and there is a slow uptake in utilising it for this purpose, as  illustrated
in the 2013 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC  on  copyright
and related rights in the information society' commissioned by the  European

The scope of the exception in article 5(3)n of the Copyright Directive
should be extended to cover all types of works. This solution would also be
in line with the recommendations in the 'Comite de Sages' report published

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

█ YES – Please explain


The exception relating to illustration for teaching or  scientific  research
provided in the Directive has been narrowly implemented at  national  level,
and as a result the permitted use of  works  in  education  differs  between
Member States. This  presents  difficulties  for  the  providers  of  online
courses that can be accessed in various EU countries.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Ideally this would be resolved  by  making  a  broad  educational  exception
mandatory for all EU countries. In Ireland the  Copyright  Review  Committee
has proposed an extension of the “research or private  study”  exemption  to
include education.

  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]

The Irish Copyright and Related Rights Act includes an exception for
purposes of instruction or examination which only covers the making of
copies, and an exception to allow performing, playing or showing works in
the course of activities of an educational establishment. The fair dealing
provision relating to research or private study also excludes electronic
databases.

  45.  If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

As mentioned in  question  43  above,  a  mandatory  exception  for  all  EU
countries would be the best solution, covering all  uses  of  all  types  of
works for illustration of  teaching,  regardless  of  the  institution,  and
computer programs, databases and multimedia works.

  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

█ YES – Please explain


Although research activities are widely  covered  by  national  legislation,
there are practical problems with  accessing  and  using  online  scientific
materials,  including  restrictive  licenses,  lack  of  accessibility,  and
issues relating to text and data mining.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

By introducing mandatory research and  education  exceptions  which  do  not
distinguish between research for  commercial  and  non-commercial  purposes,
and by promoting and implementing open  access  principles  and  encouraging
scientific publishers to make  their  publications  available  for  research
activities.

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

There is currently a “fair dealing” exemption  in  Irish  law  allowing  for
“research  or  private  study”.  It  is  important  that   any   legislative
amendments at national or European level allow for reasonable usage  in  the
course of commercial activities as  well  as  private  research,  to  foster
innovation and development of ideas.





Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

█YES – Please explain by giving examples


Currently in Ireland there is no provision  for  disabled  persons  to  make
adapted copies of works themselves, only designated bodies.  There  is  also
no onus on publishers to facilitate the making of accessible copies.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]

By adopting the Marrakesh Treaty at EU level.  In  Ireland  it  is  proposed
that the existing exception for accessible copying  should  be  extended  to
permit single copies to be made by disabled persons themselves and  multiple
designated bodies to make multiple copies.

  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]


There are limited mechanisms and the market has failed to meet consumer
need in supplying accessible formats for people with disabilities. Despite
recent technical advancements, there are still numerous barriers for
disabled people, including lack of availability of formats, cost, and legal
restrictions in copyright laws.





Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

█ YES – Please explain


European researchers are at a disadvantage compared  to  their  counterparts
in other parts of the world as they cannot lawfully undertake text and  data
mining of content as it is necessary to make copies to convert  the  content
to machine readable format. The Database Directive is also a  legal  barrier
to text and data mining as it restricts the copying  of  large  portions  of
databases.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

█ YES – Please explain


There should be more flexibility to permit easier access and use of  digital
content acquired legally. The concept of “fair use” should be  provided  for
in EU legislation and should apply to digital as well as analogue content.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the

      levies?[59]

      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial

      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


█ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

A single EU Copyright Title would be too restrictive as it would remove  the
ability of Member States to exercise national discretion on copyright law.

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

Legal copyright deposit should be extended to include  digital  publications
in all EU Member States.

A provision similar to those in Ireland, Portugal and Belgium which  prevent
licences/contracts from overriding copyright exemptions should apply  across
the  EU.  Irish  legislation  includes  the  useful  Section  2(10)  of  the
Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 which  provides  that  “where  an  act
which would otherwise infringe any of the rights conferred by  this  Act  is
permitted under this Act it is irrelevant whether or not  there  exists  any
term or condition in an agreement which purports  to  prohibit  or  restrict
that act.” We recommend that the EU lobby at  international  level  to  have
relevant  international  conventions  amended  to  include  an  article   on
invalidity of contractual provisions that remove lawful exemptions,  similar
to that provided in the Montreal Convention on  air  carrier  liability,  to
prevent  contracts  overriding  exemptions.  Article  26  states  that  “any
provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability  or  to  fix  a  lower
limit than that which is laid down in this  Convention  shall  be  null  and
void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity  of
the whole contract, which shall remain subject to  the  provisions  of  this
Convention.” A similar Article in  the  Berne  Convention  would  solve  the
problem of contracts being used to override exemptions.

Providing access to information through indexing, citing and linking  should
not be an infringement of copyright, as  this  could  seriously  hamper  all
forms  of  research  and  innovation.  The  movement  towards  banning   all
quotations of headlines, titles etc. as seen in the  Infopaq  case  must  be
resisted and reversed - referencing, citing, indexing etc. is  essential  to
all types of research and any copyright law must allow for citing of  titles
and souces and very brief extracts. In other jurisdictions (eg.  the  United
States) copyright law allows for  copying  of  single  words,  fragments  or
short phrases. It is not in  the  interests  of  rightsholders  to  restrict
effective citing.

There  should  be  provision  in  EU  law  to  cover  forwarding  of   email
communications.

Where there is implied permission to copy (for example a print  or  download
option on a website that is not made  subject  to  specific  conditions)  it
should be clear that this can be interpreted as permission to copy.

There should be an Ombudsman at  EU  level  to  oversee  the  activities  of
copyright licensing agencies and collecting  societies.   This  should  also
cover publishers / rightsholders as they are all in a monopoly position  and
digital publication and licensing  gives  them  more  power  to  abuse  that
monopoly and impose unreasonable contract conditions,  unreasonable  pricing
etc.  For example, CDs were priced at double the cost of an LP  even  though
it was much cheaper to produce a CD.  The same type  of  pricing  model  has
also frequently been applied in the publishing sphere, and  there  are  many
other issues with contracts that give rise to problems.

Technical Protection Measures should be harmonised across the EU.

of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
