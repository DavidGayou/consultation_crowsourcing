            Sports Rights Owners Coalition (SROC) Response
                           Public Consultation
                  on review of the EU copyright rules
                              March 2014


The Sports Rights Owners Coalition (SROC) is an informal group of representatives of
international, European and national sports bodies, operating as a forum through which sports
can share information and experiences. Individually and collectively, we represent a majority
of European and international sports and competitions (Football, Rugby, Tennis, Golf, Formula
1, Cricket, Athletics, Basketball, Horseracing and Equestrian sports, etc.). Our members attract
millions of spectators and our events are available to consumers across a growing variety of
broadcast platforms in Europe.

SROC members seek to engage European sports fans across multiple technological platforms
and ensure that they can access the content of their choice and benefit from the highest
quality of offer. Our service offer is continuing to expand, much faster than the pace of
regulatory change in this area, with an increasing number of European citizens accessing an
increasing number of services.

The Sports Rights Owners Coalition (SROC) is pleased to respond to this public consultation on
the review of the EU’s copyright rules. However, we are not able to define ourselves clearly
within the categories of organisation set out by the Commission, and are not concerned with
the full range of questions, so have chosen to submit this document in response rather than
completing the questionnaire. We have nevertheless indicated where possible which specific
questions within the consultation document we are addressing.

Although the consultation document does not specifically refer to sports content producers,
any reform will have significant impacts on our activities too, as we sell our rights to
broadcasters who are implicated in this review. We therefore wish to offer our own
contribution. We would also recall that in the CJEU judgement on the Premier League vs Karen
Murphy case that the Court highlighted that sports content should be considered as “subject-
matter that is worthy of protection comparable to the protection of works” 1.

October 2011, point 100.


                                                                                                   1
Question 2 – Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across
borders in the EU?

NO – As sports organisations, we do not face significant challenges in offering our legal content
to our fans when there is a substantial demand. Working through national or international
channels offered by private and public broadcasters as well as social media platforms and new
online service offerings we are able to serve up content where there is a market demand.
Broadcasters provide offers to consumers, enabling them to enjoy sports content tailored to
their local market, for example with commentators and analysts speaking their national
language and additional focus paid to competitions and athletes with greater connections to
the viewer.

Whether SROC members’ content is available across Europe depends on the demand from
broadcasters and indirectly from fans in the different countries. In that respect it is
important to recall the territorial nature of sport, which has been acknowledged by the
European Commission, together with the national nature of the markets (both upstream and
downstream) to which such sports relate (COMP/C.2-37.398).

To assist our fans in identifying all the legal platforms where they can watch their favourite
sports, SROC is in the process of setting up a new webpage which will list sports content
available from legal broadcasters on different types of platforms in each EU Member State.
This initiative was launched during the Licenses for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue. This is a
further sign of our commitment to serving our customers and stimulating the national and
cross-border legal content markets.

Question 3 – How often are you asked to grant multi territorial licenses?

In practice, there is almost no demand from broadcasters for the delivery of sports content
on a multi-territorial basis. To give an example of one hugely popular competition, the English
Premier League, in past rights sales processes in Europe, live audio-visual rights have been
tendered on both an individual territory basis and in country groups, including a pan-European
territory containing all countries in Europe (outside of the UK and Ireland). The latter did not
attract a single bid.

In fact, where there is a business case for a multi territorial approach, the market responds
positively, and sports are keen to offer their content when it is viable, to increase audience
share and serve fans in minor markets. One recent example of this was the initiative of the
England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to sell its non-domestic rights to YouTube for the Ashes
series of summer 2013 between England and Australia. Outside the UK (where a TV deal was
in place) the ECB offered full live coverage of the matches online.

Another major competition that has worked pro-actively with online platforms to share
content internationally is the French Football League (LFP). Following an agreement signed
with YouTube, the platform broadcasts a magazine programme with content including the best
goals, player profiles and five-minute match highlights from “Ligue 1” games free of charge
and across borders.. This is an excellent example of sports using online platforms to grow their
viewing figures.

In both cases of course, market considerations are diverse, but we believe this underlines that
sports certainly do not seek to restrict access where there is a legitimate request and where it
does not undermine other commercial agreements.


                                                                                               2
SROC members have not encountered any regulatory or technical barriers to offering their
content across borders within the current legislative framework, and we would therefore
once more underline that mandatory multi-territorial licensing would not reflect real
demand for sport content.

Question 5 – Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary
rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on the service recipient?

There are several reasons why sports rights owners usually favour the territoriality principle:

1/ As mentioned above, sports is territorial by nature and not all European citizens want to
access all kind of sports content (e.g. Scandinavian sports fans prefer watching ski, ice hockey
or football than rugby or cricket). Moreover, national broadcasters and online platforms are
best placed to provide quality offers which can respond to local needs (e.g. providing sports
commentaries in the local language. Indeed, most French football fans prefer to watch
Bundesliga or Serie A matches in French).

2/ It can help the development of grassroots support and participation for sports, from
stadia attendance and amateur participation to diversity of coverage. The Premier League for
instance currently does not broadcast live matches on Saturday afternoons, due to the agreed
“blocked period”, which has been endorsed by the European Commission. This “blocked
period” encourages people to practice sport at this time rather than watching it from their
homes, or alternatively, it encourages them to attend matches in stadiums across all levels of
the sporting pyramid, from professional to semi-professional and amateur matches. The
“blocked period” also enables other sports than football to generate viewing figures and
interest in a prime broadcasting slot. Non-national broadcasters are authorised to show these
matches though and an elimination of territorial broadcast restrictions would necessitate a
reduction in the offer that these foreign broadcasters have. This is clearly therefore a
disadvantage to international viewers, and contrary to the EU’s aims.

3/ It enables stronger and fairer competition between broadcasters in Europe. Indeed,
should licenses be granted on a pan-European basis exclusively, only the largest media
corporations in Europe could afford to bid for and subsequently exploit the rights. It could
give disproportionate levels of market power to such corporations within the EU, possibly
resulting in increased prices for consumers, and eventually leaving smaller territories in which
these large organisations do not operate, to receive less choice. This could significantly reduce
Europe’s sporting and cultural diversity.

4/ It benefits commercial partners and local and national businesses across Europe to have a
diversity of sports broadcasting markets, which generate associated opportunities for them
in each market. If there was one pan-European TV market for any given sports competition, it
would reduce the diversity of advertising and sponsorships, as only major multinationals would
have the finances and the desire to buy up packages targeting 500m citizens. It would
therefore hamper the growth of small national or even regional players that advertise or
partner with sports clubs, athletes and competitions.

Question 7 – Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market led-solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of
content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for
right holders?

No – In general terms, as regards the existence of barriers, we would refer the Commission to
our earlier answers to question 2. In terms of offering protection to rights holders, we would
like to elaborate further on the problems of securing our investments and fighting illicit offers,
which is fundamental to maintaining revenue generation for re-investment in new forms of
offer to new customers.

For the past five years, the EU has been considering the issue of copyright reform, licensing
and piracy, without taking significant steps to address the major problems highlighted by the
content industry. Meanwhile the market has moved on and a wide range of cross-border
offers are being provided to consumers. It is not likely that regulation would move faster than
the market in responding to customer demands and creation of new services. We would
therefore encourage the Commission to focus rather on the protection of legal content against
piracy and other infringements, so that whatever forms the market takes and however cross-
border offers are facilitated, businesses are not undermined by illegal competition. For some
time, the European Commission insisted that piracy was a result of a lack of legal offers. We
would remind the Commission that for sports content in particular, the vast majority of pirate
traffic is to events which are already legally available in the market via pay services.

In our view, piracy is the most important challenge to the development of diverse legal
content offers online. With an abundance of illegal offers polluting the online audio-visual
market, it is becoming more difficult to stimulate investments from our commercial partners
and broadcasters. Competition is tough enough as it is, without illegal free-riders being able
to piggy-back on our innovations and those of our partners.

Sports events are extremely pirated, due to their popularity but also to the fact that they are
“live” events. Most pirate websites exploit our content to create profit, thanks to advertising
revenues, without contributing to the development of the sports sector or tax revenues. This
is a major problem for sports rights owners as well as for the uptake of new content
distribution technologies (since broadcasters and partners will decrease investments).

In certain markets, SROC members have been able to develop a good working relationship
with hosting services in order to protect our content through filtering technologies. For
example, Daily Motion is able to automatically identify and remove any of the French Football
League’s audiovisual content which is put on their website without authorisation using a
“digital imprint” technology.

We believe that EU institutions can help sport and other content providers who also suffer
from piracy to find ways to promote the use of new technological tools and provide concrete
action to protect IPR. Whilst conscious of the important principles of net neutrality, we feel
that there is scope for cooperation and technical solutions to address clear breaches of law.




                                                                                                4
Question 11 – Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances be subject to
the authorisation of the right holder?

YES – Linking sites are able to re-direct users towards illegal content and generate revenue
from advertising whilst avoiding liability for copyright infringement. In this regard, we strongly
believe that the provision of a hyperlink leading to protected work should be considered as a
communication to the public.

This has just recently been recognised by the European Court of Justice (case C-466/12
“Svensson”). It held that a clickable link to a copyright work constituted a communication to
the public, which will infringe copyright in the work where the public is not authorised by the
copyright owner. This would be the case, for example, where the link is to an infringing copy of
a work.

Linking is particularly important as some technologies rely on linking to stream content. For
example, SopCast, a platform that is commonly used by Internet users who watch sports
competitions on the Internet illegally, allows streamers the ability to “inject” their own
streams and use SopCast’s platform to stream content. In essence, it becomes a user-
generated platform but it also offers the users the option of making their streams private,
meaning they cannot be found on the platform but only via linking sites.

Question 14 – What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content?

SROC would call for caution on the possibility of developing a new (or revised) framework to
enable the resale of previously purchased digital content. The copyright directive is very clear
by excluding the exhaustion principle for any act of communication to the public or making
available to the public, in line with ECJ case law. A new regime of “digital exhaustion” based
on a concept of “forward and delete” is unworkable in practice as, despite intentions of good
faith, it is not possible to verify and/or manage transfers of digital content. If the online
market place is to thrive, right holders must retain an ability to manage new business models
based on creative licensing and innovative new offers.

Question 58 – Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using
pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,
including cross borders?

YES – Protected sports content is regularly transformed and disseminated online by Internet
users, who create new montages of match highlights and also feature many trademarked logos
and brands and our competition anthems. While we do not wish to pursue individuals
aggressively, it is the case that some people are using such content as a revenue driver via
advertising models which exploit our content. Such content, for example in the form of
highlights packages, can undermine the commercial rights of SROC members and our
broadcast partners.




                                                                                                5
Questions 75 – Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

YES – The current civil enforcement system is rather ineffective as regards the fight against
live illegal streaming of sports content. There is no time for traditional legal process to be
carried out in the case of a ninety-minute football match being broadcast live by a pirate site
to tens of thousands of users. Our desire is to see a system which cuts off this illegal activity
at source in a timely fashion, and then pursues the necessary process subsequently. We are
fully aware of the challenges this presents, but feel that regulators, law enforcement bodies,
and the judiciary should work closely together with us and other relevant parties such as
internet intermediaries to address this challenge.

As mentioned repeatedly in our discussions with the European Commission, piracy of sports
content continue to increase (for example, around 17,500 illegal live-streaming of Bundesliga
matches were detected in 2012/2013, which is an amazing 647% rise compared to season
2009/2010). Sports rights owners are not facing individuals with altruistic anti-censorship or
free copyright ideals, but real and well-organised businessmen who generate large profits by
illegally broadcasting our sports events, without contributing to any of the costs that the
organisation and development of such events entail, nor any part of those revenues flowing
through to support any level of the sports (whether grassroots or otherwise).

Question 76 – Is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose?

NO – SROC believes that greater efforts are needed from ISPs and online platforms to address
illegal activities. While this should of course respect all data protection and individual privacy
requirements, we consider that there is a shared responsibility from all players to contribute to
the fight against piracy. Cooperation between different stakeholders, is key to the effective
battle against illegal activities.

For example, we would welcome additional support from search engines on de-listing or
removing infringing sites (e.g. the first page of results from a Google search for “live streaming
of premier league football” does not display any of the authorised broadcasters or online
platforms).

Questions 78 – Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title as a
means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across
the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement

NO – The territorial nature of sports is best served by the current framework which recognises
national copyright titles. Should the European Commission wish to establish such a single EU
title, it would need to carefully consider the potential consequences of its application
alongside existing territorial protection of rights owners. The Commission must also bear in
mind the full implications of such a reform. A copyright harmonisation would require similar
coordination on issues such as taxation of digital products and services, civil enforcement of
IPR, and equally important criminal measures, which as we know remain a closely-guarded
national competence for the time being.

Once again we re-iterate that it is not an appropriate or helpful solution for the sports
content sector and would not boost the ongoing development of innovative offers to our
customers and broadcast partners around Europe.

                                                                                                6
Question 80 – Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright?

Without a solution that provides effective tools for enforcement, any market, whether
national, multi-territorial or pan-European, will face illegal competition and subsequent
financial difficulties. The EU should make the current system work properly rather than
revising the rules and leaving the same challenging questions unanswered.

Should there be a reform of the EU Copyright Framework, the organisers of major sport events
should be awarded an exclusive right to authorise any communication or making available to
the public of the respective sport event. A high level of protection of intellectual property and
the principle of fair remuneration have to stay at the heart of every modification of the EU´s
Copyright Framework. Some Member States have already successfully implemented such
provisions in their national legal framework.
