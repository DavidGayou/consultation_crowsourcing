[Open question]


Our comments are general, given our status as an umbrella group rather than an organisation
managing rights, but we have explored the issue of cross-border licensing on a number of
occasions and are concerned that the above three questions seemed geared towards finding
specific examples to justify the direction of travel indicated in this consultation paper where
more and more cross-border availability of content services is the only desirable outcome. In
the audiovisual area, whether or not and when services are made available on a cross-border
basis depends on a number of market-driven factors. Most recently we set out various issues

                                                                                             3
in a paper we provided in October 2013 for the EU Licences for Europe initiative (see
http://www.bsac.uk.com/2013.html?download=261:bsac-contribution-to-the-eu-commission-
s-licenses-for-europe-initiative). In particular, we pointed out the importance of cultural
diversity in the EU, and that the first to lose out from a standardized, pan-European approach
to distribution would be the local consumer, because smaller independent producers and those
producing niche content would find it too costly to offer content via pan-EU distribution
models. We also pointed out that choices about how audiovisual material is distributed are
inextricably linked to how production of the content is funded. Moreover, we noted that
nothing in the current framework of EU and Member States’ copyright laws prevents
producers and distributors from licensing audiovisual content on a pan-European, multi-
territory basis, as illustrated by the growth in cross-border business models.
We did, however, note that aggregation of content on a pan-European basis is both capital and
labour intensive. There are many fixed costs, such as insertion of metadata, language
versioning (dubbing and subtitling), encoding, the need for differentiated marketing and press
for each language market and legal compliance, such as content classification. The high
technical and compliance costs, combined with low revenues, make pan-EU distribution a
difficult economic proposition for independent producers and distributors in Europe. For
many free-to-air services based on the licence fee and/or advertising, the deployment of cross-
border access could prove prohibitively costly, owing to the considerable financial outlay
required to implement requisite registration and verification systems. It is therefore important
to explore any concerns raised about the availability of content across the EU with a full
understanding of market issues for the many different types of content, both within a sector and in
different sectors. Different sectors in the creative industries have different characteristics,
including the business models that enable them to thrive, and so conclusions reached for one
sector should not be carried across to other sectors without fully understanding what this might
mean.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]


We have not identified any copyright problems. BSAC believes it is vital to allow the industry
to continue to develop market-led solutions to shifting patterns of use by EU consumers. The
need for market-led experimentation is vital in order to ensure that the audiovisual industry’s
sustainability is not jeopardized. The technological and market challenges we have indicated
above should not be underestimated though. We therefore proposed in our recent paper (see
our answer to question 3) that practical incentives to help stakeholders meet EU consumers’
growing demand for flexible access to content should be pursued. We suggested that funds
from Creative Europe could usefully be prioritised to support business ventures with pan-
European components by offering to share in a number of technical costs, for example
relating to encoding costs, language versioning, market research, and content identification
and registration.
We did, moreover, welcome the Commission’s Licences for Europe initiative as on some
issues at least this did prove useful. The outcome of the discussions on the cross-border
portability of services in the audiovisual sector for consumers, who have subscribed to online
services in one Member State, to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other
Member States, shows, as the Commission has recognised, that the sector is ready and willing

                                                                                                 4
to work towards the further development of cross-border portability. Initiatives such as this
should be given time to deliver results without any rush to bring forward changes to the
copyright framework.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
√ YES – Please explain by giving examples


We have already explained in answer to question 3 why it might often be necessary or
justified to impose territorial restrictions on business models. Issues relating to how
production of the content has been funded will often be important. These restrictions may, of
course, be ones that only apply when audiovisual material is first made available to the public
as the audiovisual sector would not ultimately want to prevent access to content in a country
where there is a market. However, there is strong evidence that not every genre of content
attracts cross-border demand on a scale sufficient to support viable businesses. For example,
we pointed out the very disappointing results from the uefa.com website for streaming
European Champion League football matches live in the paper referenced in our answer to
question 3. The various capital and labour costs for a number of technical issues, as we have
explained above, are also very relevant to whether there might be territorial restrictions.
Audiovisual content restricted to language territories is much more likely to be justified than
for some other types of content given the importance of the right language version to many
consumers. Consideration of how best to support cultural diversity is, of course, particularly
important, and imposing territorial restrictions might be part of how less universally popular
content continues to get made and, at least initially, then gets made available to consumers.
Cross-border licensing models are therefore consumer driven and such models will
materialise where there is sufficient consumer desire to support them in an economically
feasible manner, which is consistent with cultural diversity.
We note that two recently published studies also conclude that territorial licensing is still
important to the continued success of the audiovisual sector and the preservation of linguistic
and cultural diversity, and that regulation imposing cross-border services could mean that
consumers would face higher prices. (See the studies by Olivier Bomsel and Enders Analysis
published by LetsGoConnected at http://www.letsgoconnected.eu/studies.php in October
2013.) The Commission should therefore let the market develop in ways that benefit all
stakeholders, rather than explore regulatory solutions. In this respect, the commitments made
by the audiovisual sector as a result of the Licences for Europe are, of course, a very helpful
way forward.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
1.        The act of “making available”
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
√YES


We have ticked the “yes” box because we do not in general believe that the scope of the
“making available” right has caused problems for proper licensing of audiovisual content, in
cross-border services or otherwise, such as to justify any regulatory intervention at the
moment. In licensing the right it is, of course, essential to make sure that the actual public
who will access the material in one or more territories are taken into account as this is likely
to affect what royalties are appropriate. However, the case law that is giving additional
interpretation to this right certainly needs to be monitored as it could ultimately affect right
holders’ ability to reach fair deals on how their content is made available to the public. Any
application of the “country of origin” principle needs to be looked at very carefully in the
context of how this might impact on the exercise of exclusive rights and adversely affect
innovation in, and the growth of, new business models. It would be important to fully take

                                                                                              6
into account how producers license their content on multiple platforms in multiple territories
to underpin and sustain their investment in the production of audiovisual works.
We note that the Commission published a study shortly after this consultation commenced
which has looked in depth at the making available right. Given the length of the study and the
short time in which to respond to this consultation, we cannot claim to have considered all the
points made in the study carefully, but it looks like a helpful contribution to the debate. We
note the two alternative approaches to the making available right examined in the study,
namely a “country of origin” approach and an “exploitation” approach, based on where
exploitation takes place/the public are targeted. The conclusions of this study seem to be that
neither alternative is without problems and that the efficiency of each approach can only be
assessed if the policy objectives are stated unambiguously. In the light of this study, and the
developing case law, we would therefore urge the Commission not to rush to any legislative
changes. As the study makes clear, it is necessary to reach agreement on the policy objectives
before any legislative change can be properly assessed. There would also need to be a
comprehensive assessment of the likely impact on all stakeholders of any regulatory changes.
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
..........................................................................................................................
..........................................................................................................................
    NO OPINION
9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief)?
 √ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


We have answered “yes” because it is certainly possible, if not likely, that any clarification of
the territorial scope of the “making available” right could affect one or more of the issues
indicated. It is clear from the recently published study, which we have referred to in our
answer to question 8, that the two possible approaches explored there would have one or more
of these effects, including to adversely affect right holders’ ability to enforce their rights. As
the study makes clear, there are differences between provision in Member States’ laws
regarding authorship and ownership of rights, and contracts can also be agreed so that right
holders vary in different territories, or even possibly in different parts of the same territory.
These issues would therefore need to be explored very carefully as well as the nature of the
making available right. The study suggests that it would be very hard to avoid any problems
with possible clarification of the marking available right. The Commission should certainly
consider the various points raised in the study very carefully and commission further evidence
of the impact of any proposals when there is agreement on a clear policy objective. It would
certainly be very important, in our view, to avoid taking any action which might interfere with
how contracts can be drawn up as part of arrangements that enable audiovisual material to be
made, or which make enforcement of rights more difficult.

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO


There is not generally a problem in the audiovisual area because all of the rights are held by
the producer, although for television, particularly archive programming, it will usually be
necessary to clear online rights in the underlying content. It is particularly important to have a
reproduction right, separate from the making available right, in order to distinguish licences
for streamed services from services which permit consumers to download copies. Licensing of
the reproduction right, as something distinct from the making available right, must be secured
for services which offer downloads. The lack of any problem in the UK with the current
framework of rights is clearly demonstrated by the large (and increasing) number of licensed
online services which encompass a variety of different business models
(streaming/download/rental/purchase, cloud/device storage etc) giving consumers a range of
choices at different price points.


     NO OPINION

3.      Linking and browsing
11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
√ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why


We do not consider that all hyperlinks should require the authorisation of the right holder.
But there are some potentially complicated issues here depending on how the link is provided
and what is linked to. Indeed, even if there are situations where it is reasonable for a hyperlink
to not require the authorisation of the right holder, this does not necessarily mean that the
right holder should have no rights in relation to linking, rather than what is linked to, and the
way the link is provided, being considered to have been impliedly licensed by the right holder.
Various relevant issues have been or are, of course, currently being considered by CJEU
cases.
We do believe that in some situations there should clearly be a remedy for right holders to
deal with hyperlinks that potentially undermine how they exercise their rights. Whether or not

                                                                                                    8
this should be by making certain things acts that must require the authorisation of the right
holder, or some other approach, is something that we would like to see the subject of further
debate in the light of the decisions by the CJEU and relevant cases that have been decided by
the courts in all the Member States. It may be desirable for the Commission to arrange for a
study, which identifies the benefits of and problems with alternative solutions, before the
impact of any way forward can be properly assessed. We are, though, already able to identify
some areas where linking should not be possible without a remedy for right holders.
The first area of concern we have where we believe it should be possible to take action against
the person who has made a hyperlink available to the public is when the link is to material
that infringes copyright. If this remedy is not by making it clear that provision of the
hyperlink infringes the right of communication to the public, then there would also be the
added problem of how to ensure that it is possible to seek injunctive relief against internet
service providers where their services facilitate access to the website providing the links. In
this respect, the recent decision in the UK in Paramount Home Entertainment International
Ltd and others v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and others [2013] EWHC 3479 (Ch) (see
http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/3479.html) is interesting, because the
injunctive relief that was given depended on finding that the website FirstRow was doing
more than linking. However, this does raise the question whether right holders would be able
to obtain injunctive relief against internet service providers where a website is only providing
hyperlinks to infringing material. We do not necessarily agree with the Hon. Mr Justice
Arnold’s comments in this case on when a hyperlink amounts to a communication to the
public, and we hope that the recent CJEU decision in the Svennson case, which seems to
suggest that there would be a remedy against internet service providers, where websites are
hyperlinking to infringing content, is confirmed by other decisions in due course.
The second area of concern is where there is a deep link to content made available to the
public, by or with the consent of the right holders, and the deep link means that technical
protection measures or advertising are circumvented. This would give access to material in a
way that undermines right holders’ ability to control when and how material is accessed,
including by obtaining revenue for that access. Finally, a hyperlink made in such a way that it
is not clear that the linked material is not that of the linker is also problematic.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO OPINION
12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
√ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why




                                                                                              9
In many situations such viewing should properly fall within the scope of the temporary copy
exception and/or be impliedly licensed by right holders who have made their material
available to the public to be accessed this way. But, just as in the case of hyperlinking, there
are situations where it would certainly be reasonable to ensure that right holders are able to
take action against the person enabling the viewing, such as where the material being viewed
has been made available to the public without the authorisation of the right holders.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.        Download to own digital content

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]


The application of exhaustion of rights to intangible digital copies would be unworkable and
impact adversely on both right holders and consumers. The first problem is that a lawfully
downloaded copy, stored on a medium that can then be re-sold, would in practice be very
difficult to distinguish from illegal copies that are being re-sold, as downloaded copies are not
stored on a medium that has been branded by right holders, as is the case with sales of
physical copies. A re-sale, permitted by making the copy available via the internet to another
person, would also be indistinguishable from offers for sale of illegal copies. This would
cause tremendous problems for right holders of course, and add significantly to their
difficulties in taking action against those who are making illegal copies available, as there
would be the additional need to prove that such copies are not legal re-sales. However, third
parties who facilitate the re-selling could also face difficulties as they would not easily know
whether or not they are facilitating a legal or an illegal act. The difficulty of enforcing rights
against those who illegally keep a copy of something that they have re-sold would be
compounded by private copying exceptions that permit those copies to be made in the first
place, so there may be a number of legal copies that a re-seller would be expected to delete
before a resale. The Commission has, of course, already identified the lack of deterioration in
the quality of copies in contrast to second-hand sales of physical goods. It is also necessary to
look at the impact on the whole value chain. Resale would likely take place via a third party
                                                                                               10
platform/market place, which would make revenues from the resale of identical quality copies
of the original work, without returning rewards for the original innovation and creation back
to the right holders. A right to re-sell a downloaded digital copy would therefore have much
more of an impact on right holders’ ability to sell their content than is the case with physical
goods.
Licensing access to content already provides consumers with a range of business models,
including ones which enable content to be enjoyed with friends and family. Business models
are also being developed to facilitate the resale of digital copies in a way that enables the right
holder to be sure that the original was legal, and that the seller has destroyed all copies upon
sale. This is possible within the right holder’s ecosystem, e.g. where transactions take place
via a walled cloud service. Such business models do, therefore, already provide for what
might be covered by a digital re-sale right. These business models would be adversely
impacted with a doctrine of exhaustion of rights. Legislating in this area would therefore be a
blunt instrument with the risk of unintended consequences, including right holders being
incentivised to offer only streaming services, rather than download to own, and so cause a
reduction in consumer choice. The market is best placed to respond to consumer demand for
resale, without undermining original content investment.
We have answered this question from the viewpoint of the audiovisual sector, but the issues
we have mentioned would seem to be relevant to other sectors too.

17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


We have answered “no” not least because it would seem unfeasible or unfair to make it a
requirement to register copyright that already exists in a new registration system. Indeed in
most cases, as the Commission has recognised, requiring registration in order to exercise
rights would be contrary to international conventions in any case. Voluntary registration
systems established by various sectors are probably less likely to be overly bureaucratic, and
more likely to be kept up-to-date when there are changes in the ownership of rights, than a
single EU registration system. Encouraging such voluntary, industry-led approaches,
facilitating ever better use of metadata and exploring how to support other practical initiatives
would seem to be a better approach than establishing an EU registration system. This is, of
course, already happening in the UK with the development of a Copyright Hub to provide a
single point of entry to different databases, licensing and so on.

The Commission has noted the work to develop a Copyright Hub in the UK. Looking at the
interoperability of identifiers, as well as how to streamline copyright licensing, has been part
of this initiative. Indeed, the agreement that the ISAN and EIDR identifiers used in the
audiovisual sector should be interoperable is a direct result of this initiative. Some BSAC
Members have endorsed the work of the Linked Content Coalition. The UK Copyright Hub
continues to be an industry-led initiative, but facilitated by, with some contribution to its
initial financing from, the UK Government. The Commission could therefore certainly
explore whether it should take on a similar role at EU level.



E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO OPINION


We do not at the moment have a view on whether or not the current terms of protection are
still appropriate in the digital environment because we have not yet seen the evidence that
would be necessary to come to a conclusion. We believe that any decision on term of
protection should be based on evidence.


  II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

                                                                                             12
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO – Please explain


We have answered “no” because we think many of the exceptions and limitations work to
permit something within a Member State without problem, and so we are cautious about
suggestions that exceptions should be mandatory or more harmonised. Indeed, before we can
consider whether or not the current provision that makes most exceptions optional should be
changed, we believe that there needs to be a debate on what a more harmonised framework
would actually look like. For example, Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC sets out an
exhaustive list of areas where there can be exceptions, but the provision that Member States
can make is also qualified in that it must, when elaborated, comply with the three-step-test
requirement in Article 5(5). The recently published study that we have mentioned in our
answer to question 8 has looked in some detail into how this has led to noticeable differences
between exceptions in the same area because of the different ways they have been
implemented by Member States. That study has not looked at all the areas where exceptions
are permitted, and so it would be necessary to undertake more work of this sort to establish
the similarities and differences in all areas of permitted exceptions before there can be a
debate about whether or not they should all be more harmonised, if so, how, and then whether
or not they should be made mandatory.


  NO OPINION
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO – Please explain


Not at the moment - see our answer to question 21, where we have said that a debate about
further harmonisation would certainly have to precede the debate about which, if any,
exceptions should be mandatory.


  NO OPINION
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]



                                                                                           13
 No. We are not aware of evidence showing the need for exceptions in new areas. There
should be no changes to the areas where exceptions are permitted unless there is evidence of a
clear need for change, and then only changes to the extent necessary for that need. The current
areas for permitted exceptions do not seem to have caused the UK problems in its work to
update exceptions.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO – Please explain why


The current way provision is made in the EU regulatory framework on exceptions and
limitations seems to provide Member States with reasonable flexibility as to how they
formulate an exception. As we have indicated above, the provision in general sets out areas
where there can be exceptions, with a requirement that the three-step test should apply to the
detail of how provision is made. It is clear that this flexibility permits Member States to make
provision in different ways, and to both narrow and widen specific exceptions when this is
appropriate. Setting out what exception provision is permitted in more detail could reduce the
flexibility, and the ability of Member States to adjust specific exception provision rapidly
when the circumstances require this, and so this should only be explored where there is
clearly a problem with different exceptions in different Member States. It would then be
important to agree harmonisation in a way that does not remove the reasonable flexibility of
what can be done under existing exceptions in some Member States, such as the flexible
exception in the UK permitting “fair dealing” with a copyright work for the purposes of
criticism and review.


  NO OPINION
25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


                                                                                             14
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


In the majority of cases the use of copyright material in audiovisual productions is licensed,
and so the use does not rely on exceptions. We have therefore ticked the “no” box, as this
probably more accurately reflects our view than ticking the “yes” box, especially given the
areas in which exceptions are explored more in this consultation paper. However, for uses,
such as in news reporting, where licensing may not be realistic in the timeframes in which
extracts from material might be used by those reporting the news, some of our Members do
encounter problems with territorial limitations sometimes.


     NO OPINION
27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]


The issues raised by this question illustrate the problems of pursuing the idea of harmonising
exceptions and making them mandatory in the absence of resolving other differences between
Member States’ laws, such as on authorship and ownership of rights where there has been no
harmonisation. We do not know how it would, therefore, be possible to arrive at equitable
solutions for “fair compensation” if the effect of exceptions is that they have cross-border
effect.



A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
1.       Preservation and archiving
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]

As an umbrella group we have no direct experience in any of the above categories, but we
would in general be concerned about exceptions permitting off-site access to material as such
services could readily conflict with right holders’ business models. Having said that, though,
we do support the proposed change to the exception in the UK, which permits broadcast
material to be recorded by educational establishments and then made available to students, so
that there can, with suitable safeguards, be availability to students working at a distance from
the establishments. A very important part of this exception is, though, that it does not apply
where right holders are licensing this use. We would be very concerned about permitting
remote access without the ability for right holders to obtain compensation in some way.


33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

solution might be appropriate at national level.


35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

Licensing where right holders agree this should be the only solution, other than in very
specific situations, such as we have mentioned in answer to question 32.


3.        E – lending

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

As an umbrella group we have no direct experience of the issues raised by these questions, but
we do not believe that exceptions to rights to enable e-lending of audiovisual material would
generally be appropriate as this activity would conflict with new business models. Any
activity by libraries should therefore be as agreed under licences.


4.       Mass digitisation

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU

exceptions, but where it is to be made available to the public in general this will require
licensing to be agreed with right holders.

43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


We have indicated in answer to question 32 our support for expanding a UK exception to
permit recordings of broadcast material made by educational establishments to be made
available to distance learners, subject to the exception being overridden when this activity is
being licensed by right holders. This approach ensures that all broadcast material can be used
to support teaching at educational establishments and that distance learners get access to the
same material as those at the educational establishment. But it also ensures that this generous
permitted activity can give rise to remuneration for right holders because they have the option
to license the activity. Right holders cannot, though, prevent the activity; they can only license
it and charge royalties for the use.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]


Licensing that overrides the exception in the UK as explained in answer to question 43 does
exist. This suggests that licensing uses, beyond those covered by the exception, could
therefore be developed too where those who wish to use copyright material can make a case
to right holders and right holders do not believe that what would be permitted would conflict
with their own business models.

[Open question]


The UK is in the process of expanding the exception in the UK permitting use of audiovisual
material for research so that it covers audiovisual material. Whilst we sympathise with a
solution to meet the needs of genuine researchers, and are content for an exception to permit
the audiovisual material held in the archives of the British Film Institute and the other UK
national archives to be copied for researchers when appropriate, including where access to the
material would not otherwise be possible, we have concerns about the broad scope of the
proposed exception more generally.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]


Audiovisual material is often made available to the public with the option of sub-titles for
people who have a hearing impairment, and increasingly with audio-description for people
who are visually impaired. Whilst we do not oppose the existence of exceptions for material
that is not published, broadcast and so on with accessibility options like this, the better option
for people with a disability is to have the content at the same time as everyone else from the
same provider as everyone else with accessibility options built in. In the UK broadcasters
have been exceeding the targets that have been set for making content available with
adaptation. There can, sometimes, be non-copyright problems. For example, differences
between formats for subtitles can cause problems for service providers trying to host them.
Best practice guidance to ensure that there is standardisation of the technical requirements for
access services could reduce such problems, and governments could facilitate the
development of such guidance.

√ NO OPINION


We do not have a firm opinion on the various issues raised by text and data mining because,
until recently, we did not believe that the issue was being explored with a view to it applying
to audiovisual material. However, the proposals being developed in the UK would seem to
permit the copying of any database of any type of material in order to mine it for any sort of
information, as well as copying any content to establish a database in the first place to mine it
for data of any sort. So, for example, a person would be able to copy every piece of
audiovisual content on YouTube in order to mine it for any type of information for any (non-
commercial) purpose. It is of concern that the impact on stakeholders of such a wide provision
does not, so far, seem to have been assessed in the UK. It would certainly be important to
ensure that the impact has been assessed appropriately in the EU if the proposals being
considered might also go beyond the relatively narrow area of mining academic journals for
the purposes of scientific research.

We believe that licensing schemes, including agreements between right holders and platforms,
are, and should continue to be, an important part of any solution. It would certainly be
premature to consider any legislative solutions when there has not been time to see if the
pledges given by right holders as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions, to find
practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small
users, solve any remaining problems. A new exception certainly does not seem to be the right
approach as the use may start with individuals acting for non-commercial ends, but an
exception could not then legitimise the posting of the UGC on commercial platforms. There
is, moreover, very little evidence of problems in any case with huge amounts of UGC
containing pre-existing works in some form being created every day within the existing
copyright framework. The potential dangers of creating a new exception far outweigh the
possibilities of an exception that is fairly drawn being able to solve any problems.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]


We have not identified specific problems with the levy system because there is not a levy in
the UK. We do nevertheless have views on the problems indicated by the above questions.
We do not support the system of levies that exists in most Member States to compensate right
holders for copying under a private copying exception, especially now that new business
models are giving consumers various options about copying, and these can do so by charging
different prices of course. A private copying exception with levies can, indeed, in such
circumstances lead to situations where consumers feel they have paid twice. A better solution
is to not have a broad private copying exception and levies, but, rather, to let the market
develop choices for consumers where they can be charged differently depending on whether
they want to make one copy, several copies, store the content in the cloud and so on. For
example, in the audiovisual area, UltraViolet, a technology platform developed jointly by
consumer electronics device manufacturers, content owners and several of the larger
international film distributors, provides consumers with the ability to register UltraViolet-
enabled films and TV content that they have purchased in their personal cloud ‘locker’. The
content in a consumer’s UltraViolet library can be downloaded to a device before travelling or
streamed to a connected device whilst on the move. Services are also appearing that allow

                                                                                           26
consumers to register their existing DVD/Blu-Ray collection in their UltraViolet library. The
existence of levies could certainly undermine the future development of such consumer
friendly services because consumers might query why they should be charged for the services
at the same time as paying a levy. We note that the recommendations made by Mr António
Vitorino, in the document referenced in footnote 57 of this consultation document, support
licensing models rather than levies as the preferred approach for copies made by end users for
private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by right holders.



 IV.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
√ NO – Please explain why


In the UK, the exclusive rights granted to authors and performers are very effective in
enabling those representing these stakeholders to agree appropriate and fair deals where an
audiovisual work is made available online. Authors and performers are represented in such
negotiations by strong and effective bodies. Restricting contractual freedom, or introducing a
remuneration right, would threaten these deals in a way that would not necessarily be
beneficial to authors and performers. If such changes have the aim of delivering more money
later to performers and authors then upfront payments would need to be less, otherwise there
would be a risk of double payments.
We agree that audiovisual authors and performers should be paid fairly for their contributions
and we accept that there are various approaches to paying performers for the use of their
material in Member States. However, we do not at the moment believe that a change to EU
law would be an appropriate way forward. Deals on payments in exchange for transfer of the
exclusive rights owned by authors and performers are more likely to be able to properly take
account of the likely demand for particular material, its likely success, and so what is fair. It is
important to remember that many films do not make money. There should, for example, not
be a remuneration right applying to all online uses regardless of their profitability that might
raise expectations of an entitlement for all authors to get more money for such uses.

  V.      Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
√ YES – Please explain


Both regulatory and non-regulatory issues are relevant to the effective enforcement of rights.
We are concerned that current regulation relevant to enforcement of rights has probably not
delivered all the benefits that were hoped for, but we are not convinced that re-opening the
regulatory framework would be the right approach at the moment. We do, however, welcome
the administrative co-operation on IP enforcement through the EU Observatory on the
Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights, and hope that the Commission makes it a
priority to deliver real improvements by this non-regulatory approach.

  NO OPINION
76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]


Injunctive relief against intermediaries has been obtained a number of times in the UK in the
last year, showing that this is a very effective remedy. However, as discussed above in
relation to the issue of hyperlinking, there could be problems if certain activities by others,
which give access to infringing content, do not themselves amount to an infringement of
copyright. It is therefore important for the Commission to keep the development of case law
carefully under review and be ready to act to ensure that, in appropriate cases, intermediaries
can continue to be required to play a part in dealing with illegal content.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


                                                                                            28
√ YES – Please explain


We are not aware of any cases in the UK where there has not been an appropriate balance
reached between these rights.

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
√ NO
  NO OPINION
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]

As we have indicated above, and as is widely acknowledged, there is not usually a problem
clearing the rights in a new audiovisual work for EU-wide or other licensing deals, so we are
not sure what problem, if any, would be solved by a single EU copyright title. We do not,
therefore, believe that developing a single EU copyright title should be the next step in the
development of copyright in the EU. An entire EU copyright code would be an exceptionally
ambitious project, and gives rise to the concern of disrupting the balanced system of
protections currently in place, at national and EU levels. Right holders as well as consumers
would likely want a version that is consistent with the protections and exceptions of the
copyright law they have in their own Member State. Although there have been a number of
Directives harmonising copyright laws, there are still some very important issues not
generally harmonised by those Directives, such as authorship for many types of work, first
ownership of rights and contractual constraints or otherwise on transfers of rights. Leaving
aside the issue of whether the Commission has legal competence to regulate these norms at
the EU level, the varying legal positions and traditions of all the Member States on these
fundamental questions would pose enormous challenges. Furthermore, we are far from
convinced that such a project would actually lead to benefits in terms of growth in the creative
industries, more cross-border services, better enforcement of rights and so on.


VII.      Other issues

                                                                                             29
80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

We note that none of the questions have specifically raised the issue of technical protection
measures and the regulatory framework on this issue. Technical protection measures are, of
course, still used with much audiovisual material when it is made available to the public, and
so the interrelationship with exceptions to copyright is also important. In considering any
changes to exceptions, it is therefore important to also consider how these should apply where
technical protection measures have been used as required by Article 6(4) of Directive
2001/29/EC. Of course, there are options in that provision, and at the moment we are certainly
concerned that the UK may be about to exercise an option on this issue, in connection with its
proposed new private copying exception, in a way where stakeholders have not been
consulted on the details of how it will work. This could lead to outcomes that do not exist in
any other Member State. The Commission should certainly ensure that it has assessed how
Member States have dealt with the issue of technical protection measures and exceptions to
copyright as otherwise it will be impossible to fully understand the impact of any moves
towards greater harmonisation of exceptions.
