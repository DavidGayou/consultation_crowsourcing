 Other (Please explain):
ISAN International Agency (ISAN-IA) is a not for profit international organization
mandated by the International Standardization Organization (ISO) as the registration
authority for the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN). The ISAN is
implemented worldwide through a network of ISAN registration agencies who promote
and operate the ISAN standard locally. The deployment of ISAN in Europe is supported by
European collecting societies (producers, authors, performers, music). More than 5000
producers from all size over Europe register already their productions with ISAN and
European collecting societies are exchanging these ISAN identifiers locally and
internationally to better identify the content when they collect and redistribute royalties.
Almost 1 Million ISAN have been delivered so far, they indentify the major commercial
audiovisual works over the past 30 years in Europe and North America.
ISAN offers high guaranties in terms of multilateral governance, neutrality, intellectual
property, accessibility, usability, freedom, cost, and continuity. ISAN is owned by ISO
(164 member countries) and operated on behalf of ISO by ISAN-IA under ISO regulation
on a strict not for profit & cost recovery model.
As such, ISAN-IA has some recommendations as to what could better streamline the
identification of audiovisual content and their right holders.




                                                                                            2
II.         Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute1. Moreover a system of registration does not need to
be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered2.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
    YES
We are referring here to a central register of works only (see our answer to Question 16
below), and NOT a centralized rights registry which is a much more controversial issue.
    NO
    NO OPINION


16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
ISAN-IA believes that the registration of audiovisual works at EU level is a good idea as long
as the registration of such works is voluntary and does not constitute a precondition for the
protection and exercise of rights, in order to comply with existing international treaties. Also,
we observe that in the audiovisual sector, the centralization of rights with the producer means
that there is less demand for the creation of a centralized rights registry compared to some
other copyright industries.
ISAN-IA therefore thinks that the registration of audiovisual works shall remain separate
from the actual registration of rights. Thus, we recommend that distinct audiovisual works and
rights registries reference all common public indexes like the International Standard
Audiovisual Identifier (ISAN), that result from the work registration by the content owners in
a centralized public work registry. These shared indexes are therefore the only public keys
that enable manual or automated search, retrieval and reconciliation of works’ information
available in various distributed registries such as for example the right holders of a movie or
the localization of a specific version of the movie. We recommend that content identification
standards that have been endorsed by International standardization bodies (ISO) and/or are
significantly used in Europe by the concerned sector be used as public indexes.

  For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
2
  On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                              3
We strongly believe that within a voluntary framework as explained above, a more systematic
registration of audiovisual content in the public ISAN registry, and the propagation of the
resulting ISAN identifier in European audiovisual registries will result in substantial short
term improvements in rights identification and clearance, prevent such registered works to
become future orphan works, and enable European stakeholders from all size to interconnect
easier their resources to create new synergies, services and opportunities in the digital media
economy. Such was notably the sense of the “Declaration on Audiovisual Work Identifiers”
that was issued by WG3 of the “Licenses for Europe” stakeholder dialogue (see also our
answer to Question 19 below).


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
If voluntary, and broadly run by industry stakeholders, we do not see any.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
See answer to Question 19 below



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed3, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database4 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition5 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub6 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

  E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

[Open question]
ISAN-IA believes in interoperability and therefore in substantial short term improvement in
rights identification and clearance through the development of existing international
identification standards as a crucial first step. Such standards would be used as common
indexes between currently already existing distributed databases (see ISAN’IA’s answer to
Question n°16 above).
The License for Europe Stakeholder dialogue and the resulting “Declaration on Audiovisual
Work Identifiers” have revealed that for the first time a broad spectrum of the European
audiovisual industry recognizes the importance of a common use of an international
standard audiovisual identifier like ISAN to increase the availability of audiovisual content
online, by facilitating rights management, discoverability, and distribution of such content.

It is ISAN-IA’s view that the European Commission should support the implementation of the
“Declaration on Audiovisual Identifiers” by all stakeholders in Europe by promoting the
common use of the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) in the audiovisual
sector, and other relevant international standards in other sectors. Such promotion for the
audiovisual sector could go through:

 - Include the ISAN standard (ISO15706-1 & ISO15706-2) in the European normalization;
 - Recommend the systematic registration with ISAN of all audiovisual works produced
   and/or founded in Europe;
 - Encourage stakeholders at Member States and European level to implement measures
   facilitating wider use of ISAN;
 - Link European funding to the mandatory registration of the financed project with use of
   ISAN identifiers;
 - Encourage the systematic use of ISAN for all audiovisual and cinematographic works
   benefitting from support of the Media/Creative Europe program;
 - Consider the systematic use of ISAN in audiovisual registries operated by EU agencies
   such as the orphan works database setup by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal
   Market (OHIM).
 - Consider the systematic use of ISAN in the European Union audiovisual services and
   video library such as for the tracking and reporting of audio-visual material produced by
   the European institutions and broadcast by television channels / VOD on the EU portal.
 - Encourage Film Archives to implement ISAN in order to identify the film heritage of each
   Member state.
 - Encourage the full implementation of the interoperability between ISAN and other
   identifiers such as EIDR.

 III.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
F.      User-generated content
59.      (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?


  YES – Please explain


ISAN-IA believes that the generalized use of existing international identification standards
such as ISAN would enable end users, service providers and content owners to streamline the
identification and clearance of rights through the common use of shared reference identifiers.
