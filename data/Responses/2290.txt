PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE REVIEW OF EU COPYRIGHT RULES

Response on behalf of CREATe by Martin Kretschmer, Ronan Deazley, Lilian Edwards,
Kristofer Erickson, Burkhard Schafer and Daniel John Zizzo*

CREATe (www.create.ac.uk) is the Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the
Creative Economy, a UK national research hub jointly funded by the AHRC (Arts &
Humanities), EPSRC (Engineering & Physical Sciences) and ESRC (Economic & Social
Sciences). CREATe is a pioneering interdisciplinary initiative, and globally the first effort to
investigate the relationship between Creativity, Regulation, Enterprise and Technology
(=CREATe) through the lens of copyright law. The research programme has a strong
empirical focus. CREATe is a consortium of seven universities, centred at the University of
Glasgow.

This response attempts to make two contributions: (1) the process of policy formation
matters for the evolution of the EU legal framework, and so we offer a short critique of the
consultation format; (2) we summarise available evidence in seven thematic areas where
CREATe has developed, or is developing research (term of protection, libraries and
archives, disabilities, text and data mining, user-generated content, fair remuneration for
authors and performers, and respect for rights). CREATe understands evidence here as
empirically grounded, but open to historical and comparative approaches.


INTRODUCTION: FORMAT OF THE CONSULTATION
The Consultation follows a structured survey format more familiar from social science
research. This appears congruent with ambitions for evidence-based policy making. The
questionnaire becomes a ‘fact finding’ mission in 80 detailed questions rather than an
invitation to collect pre-written ‘position papers’ by organised stakeholders. As an
independent, empirically-minded research centre we should welcome this.
The questionnaire is mostly organised in a closed format that will allow responses to be
reported in percentage numbers, a useful device for framing future policies: “x percent
agree that the scope of the ‘making available’ right in cross-border situations is sufficiently
clear” (Q8). However, taking the social science perspective seriously, we are not optimistic
that the findings will be valid; that is: the percentage numbers may not measure what they

are trying to measure. Let us briefly outline some common problems in collecting and
reporting survey data in this form.
Many survey questions follow technical legal categories to which only a small number of
experts (typically trained as lobbyists) have access. So in many cases, answers will be a
sample of an already highly selective population. The Consultation may not elucidate what
is empirically happening but what, for example, collecting society representatives see (or
want to see). Artists, consumers, non-profit memory institutions and digital innovators in
particular will find it difficult to see the world through the lenses offered in the survey, and
are unlikely to be able to contribute meaningfully.
If the aim of the Consultation was to attract a wide range of potential policy solutions, a
format aiming for participation beyond organised groups would be recommended. Here a
form of content analysis might be an appropriate form of reporting responses (Favale and
Kretschmer, 2012).
If the aim of the Consultation was to establish facts, a survey of attitudes may not be the
best starting point. Q1 asks: “[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you
faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the
one in which you live?” Commissioned research, using scraping techniques to test
streaming services and online stores, would be able to create this evidence quickly, and
robustly.
It should also be noted that many questions are not looking for empirically grounded
evidence but normative solutions. For example: (1) Q11/12: “Should the provision of a
hyperlink/viewing of a web-page … be subject to authorisation of the rightsholder?”; (2)
Q19: “What should be the role of the EU role in promoting the adoption of identifiers …?;
(3) Q22: “Should … exceptions be made mandatory …?”; (4) Q27: “[H]ow should the
question of ‘fair compensation’ be addressed …?”
In order to respond meaningfully within the constraints outlined above, we group answers
to a range of questions around areas where empirical knowledge is emerging and should,
hopefully, influence any future legislative action. No one benefits from a distorted
worldview. We attempt to follow the broad themes of the Consultation.

TERM OF PROTECTION
In this section we respond to question 20
It is the consensus among economists and intellectual property scholars that the current
term of copyright protection far exceeds what is necessary to incentivise creative
production and imposes unnecessary costs on innovators.
The four main arguments used by incumbent rightsholders to seek longer terms have been
rehearsed extensively in the context of the recent term extension directive for performers
and sound recordings (Directive 2011/77/EU): (1) artists will earn more as a result of
copyright extension; (2) more (and more diverse) works will be produced; (3) consumers
will not pay more; (4) jurisdictions with a longer term will have a competitive advantage.
The empirical evidence points against each of these arguments (Joint Academic Statement
on Term Extension, 2008).
Research on the effects of the copyright term is hampered by the methodological difficulty
of comparing like with like; that is, two works that only differ in copyright status and
nothing else. Following the recent extension for sound recordings from 50 to 70 years (that
came into force in EU member states before the end of 2013), there is now an opportunity
for a natural experiment: comparing the market for 1962 recordings (which are now out of
copyright) with the market for 1963 recordings (protected for another 20 years). The
CREATe consortium is conducting such a study.
Given that the copyright term affects all three pillars of European copyright policy (the
single market, innovation and economic growth, and cultural diversity: Consultation, p.2) it
would be appropriate for the Commission to issue a statement on the onus of proof for any
future change.

LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES
In this section we respond to questions 28 to 41
Although the questions in this part of the consultation ostensibly are concerned with
stakeholders’ opinions on limitations and exceptions that benefit all types of cultural
institution (libraries, museums and archives), in reality they are principally directed at
copyright rules as they impact the use of and access to library collections. For example,

                                                                                          3
when considering the challenges posed by mass digitisation projects, the Consultation
presents the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on key principles on the digitisation and
making available of out of commerce works as a partial solution to this generalised problem:
“the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries, will be digitised and made available to everyone” (p.22).
The MoU is a partial solution but only for library collections. Indeed, this evident
preoccupation with the digitisation of library collections shapes the way in which the
archive is conceptualised within the Consultation itself: that is, as a space within a library, a
repository of rare books.
Library collections and archive collections are two very different phenomena. Libraries
aggregate, organise, enable access to, and assist users in navigating the world’s
accumulated knowledge. In this regard, library collections are primarily concerned with
commercially published material. Archive collections, however, are primarily concerned
with the unique records produced by organisations, families, and individuals during their
day-to-day activities or business. And while these records have considerable social, cultural,
academic and historic significance, the nature of these records is such that they are rarely
created for the purposes of commercial exploitation, and only a very small proportion of
these works have any intrinsic commercial value. Indeed, it is the organic nature of the
records selected for inclusion within an archive that makes these records so reliable,
authentic and trustworthy (ISO 15489-1, 2001, 7.2).
Moreover, the type of material held within archives typically does not fall within the
repertoire of collecting societies. For this reason, encouraging and enabling mass
digitisation initiatives on the basis of voluntary licensing schemes between cultural
institutions and collecting societies will skew Europe’s accessible digital cultural record
towards commercially published material held in libraries.
European copyright policy should, of course, address the challenges presented by e-lending
and off-premises access to library collections, and in ways that enable the widest possible
access to Europe’s library collections for the purposes of research and private study, while
at the same time appropriately protecting the commercial interests of publishers. But, our
copyright framework must also be responsive to the needs and interests of different
cultural institutions in making their collections digitally accessible (Deazley and Stobo,
2013). Devising and implementing copyright policy to facilitate mass digitisation initiatives
must draw on a research base that extends beyond studies of diligent search and rights
clearance within the publishing and library sectors. There is a policy need to understand
the way in which the work of different institutions within the cultural heritage sector is
shaped by the copyright regime. CREATe is committed to developing this research base
(Stobo et al, 2013; Deazley and Stobo, 2014), and we advocate further research within this
domain.

DISABILITIES
In this section we respond to questions 50 to 52
The Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) has given member states “the option of
providing for certain exceptions or limitations for cases such as [...] for use by people with
disabilities.” Making disability exceptions merely optional creates the obvious danger of
creating free movement barriers for EU citizens with disabilities. More research is needed
to establish the variance with which member states made use of this permission, and if, as a
result, movement of citizens with disability between EU member states was impeded.
A similar fragmentation may have happened in the market for assistive technologies and
products. The Consultation refers to the Marrakesh Treaty. While the Treaty is welcomed
in principle, the exclusive focus on it further entrenches another fragmentation, this time
between different forms of disability, for which there is no convincing rationale. The
Marrakesh Treaty focuses exclusively on visual impairment. This partly reflects the fact
that the visually impaired have experienced the most obvious access barriers caused by
copyright (and they have effective representation through the European Blind Union
(EBU)). Potential copyright barriers exist also for other media. For citizens with hearing
impairment for instance, timely provision of caption services is as important. In this field
there is at least some evidence that member states differ in their treatment of ‘unofficial’
caption providers of films and videos, who supply the material before the right holder has
issued their own version (which can be much later, if at all). Another example identified
during CREATe research are copyright barriers to modify audio and music files for tinnitus
sufferers, where legal uncertainty creates barriers for innovation in medical products for
the disabled.
Particularly large groups which have so far received little consideration in the debate are
citizens with mental health problems and those with learning disabilities. For the latter
group in particular, focus on format is less relevant than ‘easy read’ versions with
simplified language (also relevant for some deaf citizens), modified sentence structure or
symbol support. Memory impairment represents another significant constituency, and one
which due to an aging population in Europe will continue to grow in the future. For them,
search facilities that supplant their own memory can be important, as might be a right to

                                                                                            5
create a recording of live events and performances which they attend. Some assistive
technologies such as Sensecam may inadvertently violate copyright when used this way in
a memory enhancing function.
While more research into the empirical impact of copyright on various groups of
disabilities is therefore needed, from a normative–conceptual perspective, harmonised and
uniform exceptions for disability purposes that are neutral towards the technology in
question and also neutral with regard to the disability seem desirable.

TEXT AND DATA MINING
In this section we respond to questions 54 and 55
Text and data mining are acknowledged to have enormous potential both for European
industry and non-commercial research. As things stand, European copyright law
represents a sizeable barrier to exploitation by both camps since no current fair dealing
exemption clearly applies. This was acknowledged partially in the UK Hargreaves Review
where a statutory exemption for “data analysis for non-commercial research” was
proposed. Although a statutory instrument to implement this was drafted and put out for
consultation the fate of this instrument still seems uncertain at time of writing. In the EU, a
voluntary industry-based licensing solution seems to be currently favoured rather than
adding an exemption to the list permitted in the Information Society Directive
(2001/29/EC), though negotiations have been troubled and so far inconclusive.
CREATe takes the view, after a multi-jurisdictional survey, that a Hargreaves-like
exemption needs urgently implemented as part of an EU regulatory instrument, but that
consideration should also be given to taking text mining entirely out of the copyright arena
(in particular mass digitisation projects where the textbase is solely used to create new
products, not to allow full or partial public access to the original text). Discussion also

                                                                                              6
needs to be had as to whether an equivalent exemption needs developed for the database
right regime, and if so, exactly what shape that should take.
There are two main arguments behind this, one practical, one principled. First, the United
States have effectively legalised (pending appeals) text mining as a matter of
transformative use in the HathiTrust (2012) and Google Book (2013) cases. This will allow
their data and text mining industries an enormous advantage over European counterparts;
and the Google Book judgment acknowledges as one of its foundations the enormous
potential data mining has to create new research of societal and economic value. Secondly,
from a principled point of view there are severe doubts that copying and mining text
should be regarded as an infringement of copyright at all. Copyright famously protects
expression not ideas, and data and text mining exploit data and metadata not the
expressive value of the texts. As Matthew Sag, a leading scholar in the field, commented at
a recent CREATe symposium: “Copyright is ultimately about the communication of
expression to someone, to the public, and so when things are copied purely for internal
computational reasons, and not to convey their expression to the public, then that is
something that should not be recognized as copyright infringement” (Deazley and Stobo,
2014, p.91).

USER GENERATED CONTENT
In this section we respond to questions 58 to 63
The CREATe consortium is undertaking research to respond to the policy need to
understand how online user communities interact with and are impacted by copyright.
Within the UK context, we are specifically interested in measuring the impact of user-
created works on the economic exploitation of corresponding, copyright works. Early
results have shown an economic benefit to allowing more liberal user uptake of copyright
materials in online, networked settings (Erickson et al, 2013; Erickson and Kretschmer,
2014).
Contrary to the proposition put forth in the Consultation (p.29), User Generated Content
(UGC) is not flourishing in all cases. Particularly with respect to the uptake and re-use of

                                                                                          7
copyright material by consumers, the European position is unknown, ambiguous, or
unenforced.
There are three domains where our research has identified problems, but these are
indicative of a wider lack of legislative innovation. First, while many Member States have
adopted copyright exceptions for the purposes of parody, data show that European and UK
user parodies continue to be removed from platforms such as YouTube at a higher rate
than parodies of US material (Erickson and Kretschmer, 2014). Secondly, ‘machinima’
creators (videographers who use third-party video game engines to create new animation
storylines) have encountered legal roadblocks in their efforts to commercialise their new
content, despite attracting large and viable audiences on internet platforms (Haefliger et al,
2010). Thirdly, research into fan video game production demonstrates that consumers
unable to license use of original source code have sometimes re-produced new, open-
source versions of old software, meeting a market demand (Mavridou and Sloan, 2013).
This activity is often blocked by rightsholders ex post facto, although further research is
required to understand the economic cost/benefit of allowing fan works to exist parallel to
commercial re-issues.
We advocate a rigorous programme of empirical research to identify the contributions of
user creativity to the information businesses in the common market and to explore ways to
support innovation and growth. For example, new research is required in order to: (1) map
the processes by which value is generated from user activities involving copyright works;
(2) understand the scope for impact of EU law on digital platforms that are frequently
designed for one large, undifferentiated mass of users; (3) identify areas for social and
commercial innovation to the competitive advantage of European creative industries.
Dissemination of this research and policy stance should stake a competitive position for the
EU which sets a high bar for the protection and encouragement of user creativity.

FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS
In this section we respond to questions 72 to 74
The available data on authors’ and artists’ earnings come from three different sources:
government statistics (census, labour market surveys, tax); questionnaire surveys of
specific professional groups; and collecting society payments. For the purposes of assessing
the link between copyright and contract regulation, two aspects are of particular interest:
(1) the level and distribution of earnings of creators, compared to other professions; (2)
earnings from the principal artistic activity compared to other sources of earnings. There is
now a robust body of evidence regarding both these matters which should form the basis
for any legislative intervention (Atladottir et al, 2013; Thomson and Cook, 2012-14;
Kretschmer et al, 2010; Kretschmer et al, 2011).
Key findings include: (1) creators’ occupational profiles reveal risky, often stuttering
careers; (2) earnings from non-copyright, and even non-artistic activities are an important
source of income for most creators; (3) many more creators attempt to embark on artistic
careers than are able to sustain them; (4) the more copyright related the income stream,
the more extreme is the distribution of income, reflected in very high Gini coefficients (a
measure of inequality); (5) a small number of very high earners earn a disproportionate
share of total income.
The Commission needs to be clear if they envisage any attempted regulation of copyright
contracts to be effective against this underlying ‘winner-take-all’ current of cultural
markets.

RESPECT FOR RIGHTS
In this section we respond to questions 75, 76 and 80
Questions 75 and 76 seem to make the case that the civil enforcement system is insufficient
to meet the challenges of the internet revolution. We start by noting that any intervention
on the enforcement of intellectual property rights should be based on an understanding of
the causes and effects of unlawful behavior. Using systematic reviewing techniques drawn
from the medical sciences, CREATe has undertaken a scoping review of all evidence
published between 2003-2013 into the welfare implications and determinants of unlawful
file sharing (Watson et al, 2014). Articles on unlawful file sharing for digital media
including music, film, television, videogames, software and books, were methodically
searched; non-academic literature was sought from key stakeholders and research centres.
54,441 sources were initially found with a wide search and were narrowed down to 206
articles which examined human behavior, intentions or attitudes.
Whether unlawful file sharing confers a net societal cost or benefit to welfare remains
unclear based on the available evidence, with both of the approaches employed – (1)
looking at the association between sales and unlawful file sharing, and (2) examining
people’s willingness to pay with and without the possibility of unlawful file sharing –
suffering from serious limitations. This conclusion casts doubt on approaches which
strengthen the civil enforcement system to meet the challenges of the internet revolution,
at least without clearer evidence of demonstrable benefits of specific measures.
CREATe has developed a utility framework to understand potentially relevant factors
whether to engage in unlawful downloads, legal purchases (or neither). They include
financial and legal utility – where the civil enforcement system is clearly potentially
relevant – as well as unrelated aspects such as experiential utility, technical utility, social
utility, and moral utility. The findings of our scoping review have been visualised in a cubic
space where the number of sources of evidence identified for each proposed determinant
of unlawful file sharing are split according to evidence type and specific media (see below).
It demonstrates that our current knowledge of file sharing is dramatically skewed by
method and sector.
The unlawful file sharing debate seems to have been predominantly determined by
evidence from music files. Movies and software are a distant second. There is very little on
videogames, books, or TV content. However, there is evidence to suggest that the
determinants and welfare implications of one medium may not apply equally to another.
Therefore there is a danger in basing policy decisions upon evidence heavily biased toward
a single medium.




                                                                                            10
The vast majority of the studies found in our scoping review employ cross sectional survey
studies which make attributions of causality extremely difficult. Furthermore, our scoping
review also shows the comparative scarcity of studies that employ observed behavior as a
measured outcome, whether from the experimental laboratory or from the natural world.
This is a problem, particularly as there is often a gap in findings between studies that use
behavior and studies that do not. In the context of financial and legal utility, we find that as
new enforcement laws are introduced, there is limited behavioral data which could confirm
a causal effect, particularly in the long term.
There is a definite need for more experimental economic and longitudinal samples capable
of identifying causality links and starting to assess the potential of policy changes to affect
unlawful file sharing behavior. There is also a need to explore, more systematically, a wider
spectrum of markets, as copyright frameworks do not normally differentiate across
markets. Policies and assessments purely considered in terms of music files, or even a
combination of music files and movies, may not be fit for purpose when considering other
markets. Better evidence-based policy is needed.
