SUBMISSION FROM


British Library

The British Library, the national library of the United Kingdom, very much welcomes the
opportunity to comment on this consultation.

As the national library of the United Kingdom and the largest research library in the European
Union, the Library knows well the importance of copyright as a tool to manage and control
the flow of copyright goods to create a well-educated society that underpins the UK
knowledge economy. The Library has direct and a probably unique experience of the
information ecology. It is not only a legal deposit library, purchaser of content, and licensee
of publishers and collecting societies but also a publisher of databases, CDs and books,
clearer of rights, licensor of IPR and exerciser of exceptions in law. We also support the
creative industries through not only our unique collections but the Business and Intellectual
Property Centre which is the largest resource of business information in the UK and also runs
popular training courses on intellectual property for small businesses.

Our collections and services are multinational, multilingual and people come from across the
globe to use them.

II       Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
  Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. Like other national libraries, the British Library in particular is interested in digitising its
in-copyright collections where flexible and proportionate legal mechanisms exist to do so.
Despite this being a focus of much Commission activity including for example the i2010
Digital Libraries Programme, “New Renaissance”, Commission Recommendations to
Member States8, Out of Commerce Memorandum of Understanding etc, there are still only a
handful of countries that have laws in place to facilitate mass digitisation. In addition to this,
given that our collection is very multinational in nature, and communication to the public
involves all jurisdictions globally we think it important to develop legal mechanisms, to allow
cross-border legal access to the fruits of not only digital library projects, but mass digitisation
public-private partnerships also.
Within the EU whereas Extended Collective Licensing exists in law in the UK (primary
legislation), Finland, Sweden, Denmark and the Czech Republic, its legal validity cross-
borders given the inclusion of non-members’ works could benefit from further legal
clarification. That is to say the use of works of non-members within a member state is lawful
under ECL but its position cross-borders is much less clear as to all intents and purposes non-
members are exclusive rights are being limited. We note that similar uncertainties of this
nature have in the past resulted in legislation such as the Satellite and Cable Directive.
The UK government has at this moment that we are aware of no plans to introduce a specific
law to facilitate mass digitisation of content. We would highlight that we are very concerned
that given the way the draft secondary regulations on Extended Collective Licensing currently
are written that ECL will not become a route for mass digitisation at all. For example, the

current draft would allow an ECL for a period of 5 years only which will not encourage any
investment in digitisation projects of in-copyright works given the significant costs related to
such undertakings.
Different legal mechanisms are being introduced in France and Germany to facilitate mass
digitisation, and the cross borders aspects of these laws would also benefit from legal clarity
given the inclusion of orphan works and non-members in such schemes. Certainly as pointed
out above there is precedent for legislative activity in this area within the Aquis
Communautaire in form of the Orphan Works Directive and the Satellite and Cable
Directive9.
2. The British Library is starting to grapple with the immense technical, financial and
resource implications of digital preservation and sharing preserved collections with its users.
We are aware for example of discussions amongst the Baltic States of a single centralised
digital preservation digital infrastructure which would have to provide online access to
participants, and their users, cross-border amongst the three countries that comprise the Baltic
States. Digital preservation is in its infancy, and provides modern day society with many
challenges in regards to how to preserve digital history for future generations. Given its
immature nature combined with limited budgets for digital preservation even amongst the
larger member states, it is only natural that countries like those in the Baltic region explore a
shared international preservation infrastructure.
Clearly one current challenge to the development of such preservation services is the
fragmented nature of EU copyright laws, and the lack of clarity around their cross-border
application. Even at a member state level it is certainly common for countries laws to not be
fully “digitally compliant”. In addition to this we would raise the issue that often the laws are
crafted around one organisation preserving its own collection. This is not feasible and does
not reflect modern day digital preservation practice where mirror servers / multiple copies of
items need to be run, and different aspects of the end to end digital preservation process will
have to be carried out by experts who may or may not even be in the same country. There are
also significant collections which will sit in a number of large or national libraries that make
historical and logical sense to bring together as one whole, rather than to sit as fragmented
parts across different infrastructures across the EU.

would be the best way to tackle them?
In terms of the points outlined above we believe that the Commission should actively explore
this issue or clarify whether limitations and exceptions / laws relating to mass digitisation are
already cross-border in their effect in the single market.

there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC10on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software11 and databases12.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders13 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format)over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies14,(notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and at
the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication
to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of
the works in digital networks15. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public16. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

13
    Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
14
    The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
15
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (PezHejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach17)

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief18)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

     NO OPINION

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?




17
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
18
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU19 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU20 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)
No. As the British Library and indeed the profession of librarianship is dedicated to the
sharing of knowledge we think that the basic units of knowledge and information sharing,
such as facts, data, a hyperlink, or indeed an individual catalogue entry should not attract
copyright.
Certainly in the light of the recent CJEU Svensson case we believe that the court’s decision
should help clarify the fact that the use of a hyperlink that is publicly accessible is not an
infringement in the context of it being shared with other people and organisations. If the Court
of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) were to decide at any future point in time that a
hyperlink did contain copyright, we believe the EU Directive must ensure that hyperlinks are
covered by a limitation and exception.

Without the ability to link to web sites and move from one site to another freely, information
sharing in the context of the internet will not be able to function lawfully. It is perhaps
difficult to overstate the negative impact this would have on the European knowledge
economy. In the context of a libraries activities hyperlinks also are increasingly forming part
of a library’s catalogue pointing to material that sits on the web.
On this point we believe that the parallels between a hyperlink and an analogue catalogue
record are many, and catalogue records have not been something that courts or legislatures
have sought to exert copyright over traditionally.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright
exception)
No. Whereas we are of course aware of Art.5 (1) we believe that as is the case in the analogue
world the act of merely viewing, reading or listening including by a machine, is something
that should not be an exclusive act in copyright law. Copyright law seeks to protect the reuse
of a copyright work; irrespective of the technology used it should not regulate the basic
human activities required to access a copyright work in the first place - namely viewing,
reading or listening. This would result in significant implications for viewers of copyright
material held by the British Library and would restrict access to information.
We wonder whether the European Commission should evaluate the positives and negatives
(including the impact on legislative timetables, civil servant / economists time etc) of how the
current reproduction right works. In a world dominated by machines that reproduce works
(public domain, licensed and governed by copyright) the Commission should perhaps assess
whether regulating the simple act of copying by machines as we currently do (we not for
example Art.5 (1) has large gaps in terms of the types and intents of reproduction that takes
place on a machine automatically) is the best approach, or whether regulating the
reproduction right through the lens of the making available right and the economic harm the
reproduction does, is a better solution.

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner

                                                                                             10
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)21. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)22. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute23. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not

   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lexspecialisin relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed25, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database26 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition27 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub28 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
We strongly support measures to promote the use of identifiers.




24
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
25
    E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention29 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

environment?

III.        Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive2001/29/EC30.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law31. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 32, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional33, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")34.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Please see the two examples given in the response to Question 2 that relate to issues

34
  Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                          14
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
There may be a number of legal solutions to the issues faced by the British Library raised in
question 2. However perhaps the most obvious solution would be to increase legal
harmonisation across EU member states, which in turn suggests that they may have to be
mandatory in order to achieve harmonisation.
We would recommend that the European Commission looks at this issue in a comprehensive
manner given that the aim of the EU is to create a single European market. We note that in the
case of the Orphan Works Directive and in the Satellite and Cable Directive in regards to the
licensed use of works of non-members limitations and exceptions to the exclusive rights have
explicitly been made cross-border.
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


We believe that all exceptions relating to education, research, library and reuse in a cultural
context need to remain. In terms of new exceptions the British Library believes that an
exception for Text and Data Mining is required. People can no longer read and make sense of

technique allowing significant savings in organising data - from the creation of online
catalogues through to the structuring of data holdings that reduce search and processing time.
It is certain also that one of the most useful means used to access and analyse mass digitised
content in a digital library will be the technique of content mining.

Although the extraction of facts or individual words is not subject to copyright law, and a
human being copying a word or a fact with a pen or pencil is perfectly free to do so, due to the
fact a computer must make a copy of an entire work in order to perform the same activity, the
process of content mining becomes subject to copyright law and also database rights. Few
contracts from our experience allow data mining. In short, the law currently allows a human to
read digital content they have bought or have legal access to, and make associations between
the facts contained therein, but it does not permit a computer programme, based at the same
location as the human researcher, to undertake the same work. This certainly seems illogical
and out of kilter with the needs of a modern economy.

In order to create new innovation, economic value, as well as make significant cost savings
for society the practice of content mining, and the barriers that exist due to current European
copyright and database laws must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Copyright law which
was developed over 300 years ago was not designed with such uses in mind. In order to
ensure that copyright supports innovation in the future as it has done in the past, it must seek
to ensure it facilitates new technological innovation and computer based techniques to analyse
data.

Given this computer-based technology offers enormous potential to speed up life-changing
scientific discovery, create significant organisational savings for the British Library, other
libraries and private companies, as well as create many other forms of economic value,         15
existing limitations and exceptions should be extended to explicitly cover the technique of
content mining. Without this the innovation, productivity and growth that can come from
harnessing the full potential of big data will never be realised.
 24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
 degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES
Taking the issue of Orphan Works as one example the British Library observes that because
of the structure of the Information Society Directive’s exhaustive list of limitations and
exceptions, despite the high importance that reports such as Comité des Sages “New
Renaissance” place on public-private partnerships, the Orphan Works Directive does not
allow private companies to enjoy the exception. The British Library, similarly to a number of
national libraries, works with a number of the world’s most significant secondary publishers
who from our discussions with them would no doubt benefit from such laws.
Similarly we believe that content mining should allow commercial use of these techniques in
order to promote EU based businesses, but also to lower barriers to scientific innovation in
areas such as medicine, chemistry, environmental sciences etc.
In addition to this we observe that from the establishment of i2010 Digital Libraries project to
the implementation of the Orphan Works Directive in 2012, and transposition in 2014 it has
taken circa eight years. At a UK level also the British Library has spent a great deal of time
working on limitations and exceptions and collective licensing since 2005. Nine years later
we are still working on the same issues that are only part way into making themselves into
law.
Based on this we believe it would be beneficial to evaluate whether there are other more
flexible ways to ensure that reasonable changes to technology and working practices can be
accommodated within existing copyright law.

[Open question]

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving35and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions36. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive37.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make).Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a rightholder:]Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

While Art.5.2.c allows preservation in any media, the issue faced by the national libraries,
including the British Library who rely on copyright law as opposed to legal deposit law to
preserve part or all of their collections is the fragmented nature of laws relating to
preservation at the member state level. Studies such as the World Intellectual Property Study
“Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries and Archives”38demonstrate this
fragmentation in detail, and the number of EU countries that have failed to update their
limitations and exceptions in line with digital developments.39
This of course is well recognised by the European Commission who in the “Commission
Recommendation of 27.10. 2011 on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural
material and digital preservation” called on member states to:
“make explicit and clear provision in their legislation so as to allow multiple copying and
migration of digital cultural material by public institutions for preservation purposes, in full
respect of European Union and international legislation on intellectual property rights.”
As far as we are aware it is only the UK that has made concrete steps to do this, with Ireland’s
review of copyright suggesting that they may follow suit soon.
We would recommend that digital preservation laws must as a minimum provide the
following for any type of copyright work:
i) Format shifting;
ii) multiple copies to be made;
And that this should be
iii) irrespective of TPMs and contractual provisions to the contrary; and
iv) that this preservation activity can be sub-contracted or shared with other libraries etc.
As indicated in our answer to Question 2 we believe that laws that allow digital preservation
networks between institutions and countries is something that should be facilitated through
copyright law.
The British Library has collections stretching back over 2000 years, and our challenge is to
not only have analogue items preserved in perpetuity, but digital ones also. We believe this is
a huge technical and financial challenge for Europe, but at the same time an extremely
important one. What will a future Europe be like without a record of its digital history?
Given the technical unknowns of how to preserve our digital history we believe it important
that any preservation exception is as flexible and enabling as possible. As outlined above the
Baltic States are discussing a shared preservation infrastructure. In the UK for legal deposit
libraries we have a distributed infrastructure between London, Boston Spa, Aberystwyth, and
Edinburgh for precisely this reason. Given that digital preservation networks are highly

desirable in order to maximise our chance of preserving Europe’s digital past we believe that
the establishment of archives that can share infrastructures is extremely important.
Of course many libraries will have many copies of the same item or in order to create
historically coherent digitised collection will wish to work together. One example of this is
Germany where scores of copies of theses must be distributed in university libraries and
beyond (see Annex). The same German language theses are therefore available from libraries
in Germany and Austria, as well as presumably other German language speaking countries
including Switzerland. Another example is Parlophone records (or many other large sound
labels) which was active not only in Germany and the UK but France also. Requiring separate
institutions to invest separately in archiving potentially the same materials digitally is illogical
and wasteful of predominantly publicly financed resource.
29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Many solutions could be envisaged to ensure that there is across the whole single European
market a digitally enabling preservation exception. Any such solution would we believe have
to incorporate the points raised above and ensure it is lawful across borders.

elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e., when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
   YES – The British Library has found it extremely difficult to negotiate remote access
subscription content due to its position as a national library.

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples.
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across

problems have you encountered?


4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce),which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other40. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive),the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)41.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
The British Library were involved in negotiating the MOU on Out of Commerce Works,
which of course is no more than an MOU between a number of trade bodies and library
representative groups. Given its lack of legal standing in law it has to our knowledge not
resulted in any digitisation as it does not provide the requisite legal certainty. We believe that

40
    More information about the MoU can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-
commerce/index_en.htm .
41
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightsholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             21
legislation of the type envisaged by the MOU that allows cross-border use of the works
digitised would be a vital step to allowing national libraries to digitise in-copyright
collections, and for the public, academics etc to access them.
We also can vouch that there is much interest amongst citizens, scholars, pupils, teachers etc
in the digitisations of 20th century works. The Bøkhylla Project currently implemented by the
National Library of Norway had, as of August 2010, 10.3 million book pages visited and
69.4% of all titles available on the site accessed by users at some point showing a real public
interest in accessing 20th century in-copyright works. During 2012, as many as 51 million
page views were recorded through bokhylla.no – a figure approximately ten times that of
Norway’s population
Although out of copyright another example is that at the end of 2013 the British Library put 1
million images from 19th century British books online and we are proud to report that these
are visited on average half a million times a day from people all over the world.
The British Library has also undertaken a number of in-copyright mass digitisation projects
ranging from the Archival Sounds Project to the Europeana World War 1 project and can
therefore attest to the large amount of time, and complexities involved in the digitising in
copyright material where large numbers of works have to be cleared on an item by item basis.
This unfortunately leads to distortions in the historical record as public domain or openly
licensed content (such as UK governmental material) is prioritised over copyright works that
require in-depth and often complex diligent search and rights clearance.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC42 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from

42
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               22
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

C.          Research
Directive 2001/29/EC43 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC44 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)45.

The Marrakesh Treaty46 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
     YES– Please explain by giving examples
As a national library, the services of the British Library should be on offer to all citizens on an
equal footing – able-bodied or not. The laws across the EU for the disabled vary from member
state to member state and depending on the country either achieve equal access to information
and knowledge for those with disabilities, or do not.

51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
The swift ratification, implementation and application of the Marrakesh Treaty by the EU and
its Member States is needed to improve accessibility for persons with visual impairments
across the single market.
Whereas Art.5.3(b) of the Information Society Directive is enabling, the issue is what has
been enacted, or more pertinently not enacted at the member state level. Clearly legal
mechanisms to protect the information needs and human rights of European citizens with
disabilities should be found so they have the same ability to access and reuse knowledge
provided by the British Library and other institutions as able-bodied people.
52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics47 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by



47
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              25
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”48.In the context of these discussions, other
stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which
access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific
exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction
between commercial and non-commercial.



53.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders? Yes we have experienced problems trying to establish the legal
position of text and data mining in regards to the internet and licensed content, and therefore
have not done text mining on in-copyright works yet though have some permissions to do so.
We have however done text mining on public domain materials because of the clear legal
certainty around mining this content.
We also note that in Fair Use countries like the US, Singapore, Israel and South Korea that
organisations, ranging from technology companies to research institutions like our own carry
out text mining under the umbrella of fair use – this was underlined as part of the Fair Use
ruling in regards to the Google Book Settlement and gives North American universities a
significant degree of competitive advantage over universities, and knowledge transfer
companies based in the EU.
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders? Yes.
Given that content mining requires the reproduction of digital content that one has legal
access to already (irrespective of the economic harm that reproduction and adaption makes of
content one has legal access to already), text and data mining is arguably subject to copyright
and database rights even if the output itself is not.
As a research library we have access to approximately 645,000,000 websites (source:Netcraft)
and purchase access to circa 2000 plus electronic resources each year – this translating into
tens of thousands of electronic titles. A library purchases access to content for it to be used,
read and analysed and if this is electronic content this by definition includes with the aid of a
computer.
Atypical of most university libraries the British Library has a small team of less than 2 full
time equivalents who are dedicated to e journal licensing, as well as access to a third member
of staff who is able to help on the licensing of other types electronic content. Despite actively
trying to negotiate content mining rights over a number of years the library currently only has
rights to mine 16 publishers’ content, encapsulating two variant types of terms and conditions
– one requiring the publisher to be informed when performing computer-based research, and
the other not.
We also have experience of seeking permissions from web-based rightsholders over a period
of 8 years. The library sent out 17,777 requests and had permissions from 4453 website
holders, in regards to approximately 9.62 million UK websites (source: Nominet). Given the
hundreds of millions of websites that exist,which in aggregate form probably the largest

database in the world, as these statistics show seeking permissions on a case by case basis is
simply not practical or indeed possible.
In terms of practical application of the licences that the library has managed to acquire we
now face the following issues:
i) We have decided not to utilise the licences that require the publishing intermediary to be
informed as we believe from our experience this will create problems downstream being
drawn into unsatisfactory discussions with no likely end-point. We also do not know ahead of
doing the mining what queries we are actually going to run and therefore what the outputs are,
making a discussion about what we are going to do with the content not possible. The
analogue equivalent of this is to ask what ideas, theories and information you are going to
extract before you are allowed to take notes from the book you have purchased. Something
most people would probably agree is not proportionate or indeed appropriate.
 Having to “isolate” one type of content / output from another also creates extra work and
uncertainty around how the outputs from content mining can be used.
ii) As even this simple binary combination shows having varying terms and conditions to use
the content can easily make computer-based research unmanageable.
iii) In regards to the licensed content we also have the complex issue of having to interpret a
negotiated provision with a publisher we have a one to one ongoing relationship with. Content
mining from end to end is a very complex process, with from an IPR perspective many
unknown questions. Legal and non-legal staff are now currently therefore in the difficult
position of trying to understand the boundaries of the T&Cs we have negotiated, and decide
whether the outputs of TDM (for example a probability, or the number of times a word has
been used, a taxonomical tag to a block of content, a statistical conclusion based on what has
not been written about in the text etc) is subject to copyright law / licence or not. These
discussions have taken close to a year and no mining has of yet commenced.
This issue is particularly pertinent given that the ECJ 2014 Svensson ruling has established
the principle of a “new public”. That is to say in the Svensson ruling one of the important
decisions in the case was that it was not an infringement because there was no reuse of the
work by “a public that was not taken into account by the copyright holders when they
authorised the initial communication to the public.” If one is to follow the principles
established by this case it is hard to argue that use of econtent by those who have lawful
access to it was not foreseen by the licensor / copyright holder. In addition if the output from
the reproduction of works communicated to the public that one has legal access to is not
shared with a “new public”, and only results which are either not subject to copyright law, or
do not undermine the legitimate interests of the rightsholders are shared with a “new public” it
is hard to understand what legitimate economic interests are undermined.
Certainly in the sphere of scholarly information the intention of the author themselves is for
their material to be researched and analysed, resulting in further learning and knowledge
sharing.
We would contrast the above uncertain licence based position with the far more assured and
enabling position that one is in when relying upon limitations and exceptions. With
exceptions the starting position is a general “right” with regards to one’s use of information
which is to be challenged if not exercised appropriately, rather than having no rights at all
which then have to be negotiated.
This contrasts with the more imbalanced and difficult one to one relationship with a specific
rightsholder (who may or may not have the resource to discuss the issue at hand) for whom

                                                                                             27
you may be one of many thousands of customers. The relationship between a publisher and a
research library is also not one that reflects the principle of “freedom of contract” given that if
a university offers a course, or is known for research excellence in a certain field, it is
unthinkable to not subscribe to certain publishers’ outputs.

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
If it was concluded that content mining does affect the exclusive rights granted in copyright
and database law we believe that there should be an exception to both these fields of law.

They would best be solved by a legal exception to copyright law and database rights to allow
text and data mining / analysis on works that organisations / individuals have lawful access to.
This would allow the EU to compete on a level playing field in new research and technology
markets with the US, Japan, and other countries in South East and East Asia.
55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
In order to maximise innovation in Europe and maximise the substantial investment made by
companies, individuals, and research institutions in staff, technologies, skills and (if
appropriate) the purchase of information, we believe that the reuse of materials that one has
lawful access to should be lawful for content mining purposes within the confines of the three
step test.

It is also very important in this discussion to ensure a clear distinction between content that is
subject to copyright or database rights, and that which is not, such as facts and data and
material insubstantial enough not to display any artistic expression.

We believe that it will be important also to establish what if any economic harm is done by
computers reproducing a work, or adapting a work if one already has legal access to it if the
material is not being communicated to a “new public” and the material being shared is not
substitutable and does not undermine the reasonable market value of the original work. For
example if members of a university have legal access to certain subscribed to content, what
economic harm is done by university’s computers reproducing and adapting that work and
then sharing it amongst those who already have legal access to the original? As a library who
                                                                                                28
purchases a large amount of electronic content, in common with all university libraries
globally, our expectation when purchasing content is that those who have licensed access to
this content should be able to use that content freely subject to the three step test or
appropriate limitations and exceptions such as fair use etc.

Any exception that deals with content mining would have to ensure that any communication
to a new public of a work that is subject to copyright or database rights would be limited by
the three step test. That is to say the output from the reproduction / adaption of copyright /
database works when communicated to the public / a new public should not undermine the
reasonable interests of the copyright holder, and the market value of the original copyright
work.


56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
Yes. There are a number of issues including
a) A lack of content mining skills;
b) A lack of courses teaching the appropriate skills;
c) A lack of licences allowing content mining;
d) As highlighted by the Finch Report a lack of publisher metadata telling researchers which
content has been paid for by authors/ funders and is available under a Creative Commons
licence thus allowing text and data mining;
e) A lack of universities who hold published content locally on their own systems thus
allowing content mining by their researchers.




F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs49. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with

49
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph.Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                          29
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions50.

IV.            Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying51. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her

51
     Article 5.2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                             31
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5253.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions54 in the digital environment?

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.

devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments57.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free

V.             Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers58or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 59. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
We believe there are many mechanisms to ensure that authors and creators are rewarded
appropriately for their work. They range from research funding and author payment charges
in the context of gold open access, through to direct negotiations with rights holders,
collective licensing and in the case of books lent from public libraries, the public lending
right.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

VI.         Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE60 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text61. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose62. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure63. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright

60

of intellectual property rights.
61
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
62
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
63
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           35
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
The British Library believes that any legislation dealing with intermediaries on the Internet
has to be extremely well thought through and defined appropriately.
There are many types of internet intermediaries ranging from ISPs as mentioned here, through
shops, hotels to schools, libraries and universities. In the UK and New Zealand for example,
poor drafting of three strikes legislation meant that “public intermediaries” like schools,
libraries, local governments and universities were essentially defined as intermediaries in the
same way as internet service providers or Telcos.
We believe it very important that any legislation dealing with intermediaries needs to be
cognisant of the different types of intermediary that exist when delivering internet access to
citizens in particular those that have a public policy function like a public library or
educational establishment

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

VII.      A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

Yes.

1.     The overwhelming majority of paid for digital content in the UK, as in most other EU
member states is not regulated by copyright law but by contract law. We believe this is not
the case in Belgium, Portugal and Ireland. The UK is also in the process of protecting
research and educational exceptions from contractual override.
Also the types of agreement that exist between libraries and publishers are also not subject to
Unfair Terms type legislation in the UK, which in the main is only pertinent to individuals/
consumers who purchase products and services.

Evidence in the form of a British Library analysis of 100 contracts offered to it for electronic
publications benchmarking contracts against UK exceptions shows that well over 90% of all
contracts undermine copyright law. A summary of the findings appear below. N.B. It is also
worth stressing that silence in a contract is tantamount to a “no” so in the case below 98% of
contracts did not allow copying for the visually impaired. (see

                                                                                                                                           37
material predicts that by 2020 80% of all commercially published educational material will be
available electronically, 40% exclusively electronically.

The lack of certainty around reuse of content also acts as a disincentive to purchasers, and acts
as a self-limiting factor preventing a certain level of sales. For example certain digital
databases have not been purchased by the British Library as their usage restrictions were too
onerous and undermining of limitations and exceptions.

Other impacts include:

                   a) A lack of clarity for purchasers regarding how to use a particular e-resource as
                      well as increasing transactional overheads of individuals, usually not lawyers,
                      having to interpret how a particular item can be used lawfully;
                   b) An impossibility for an educational establishment or library to lawfully
                      manage electronic content given that each contract is different;
                   c) A lack of clarity for users wishing to use electronic resources who usually will
                      not have access to a confidential contract between a library and a publisher.
                      This contrasts markedly with the relatively well understood principle of “fair
                      dealing” and rule of thumb of one chapter or article from a publication.
                   d) Increased confusion around the law and how it relates to accessing copyright
                      works as a user’s “rights” to access, even for the same article or book chapter,
                      will vary according to whether the object is in a paper form or in electronic
                      form;
                   e) The legal exposure of publicly funded institutions to laws and parctices of
                      foreign countries. For example most US content is supplied under the law of a
                      US state, of which most EU institutions will have no or little experience, and
                      contracts will often refer to Fair Use.

While fair dealing in the UK is generally accepted to equate to a book chapter or a journal
article and therefore easy for users to comply with, contract by contract usage variations are
extremely onerous, and due to their variation give little security to purchasers, and mean high
management costs for purchasers of digital content such as universities.

Recommendation: Currently in EU law contracts that relate to sui generis databases cannot be
undermined by contract law. A number of EU member states (Portugal, Ireland and Belgium)
also forbid the over-riding of limitations and exceptions in copyright law by contract law in
order to protect the public interest and guard against market failure. We would recommend as
is the case in Ireland that the following wording is adapted for the Information Society
Directive:

COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS ACT, NUMBER 28 of 2000 64

S2(10) Where an act which would otherwise infringe any of the rights conferred by this Act is
permitted under this Act it is irrelevant whether or not there exists any term or condition in an
agreement which purports to prohibit or restrict that act.

     2. We would also like to point out given the huge impact copyright laws have on
        education and research that, as evidenced by the issues that surfaced in Licences for
        Europe that there is little formal involvement of DG Research and Innovation in the

formation of EU level copyright policies. We believe this issue has to be structurally
addressed by the Commission as a matter of urgency.

Der Doktorand ist verpflichtet, eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit (Dissertation) schriftlich
anzufertigen und das Ergebnis in angemessener Weise der wissenschaftlichen Öffentlichkeit
durch Vervielfältigung und Verbreitung zugänglich zu machen.
Diese Verpflichtungen stellen eine Einheit im Sinne einer wissenschaftlichen Leistung dar.
In angemessener Weise der wissenschaftlichen Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht ist die
Dissertation dann, wenn der Verfasser neben dem für die Prüfungsakten (des Fachbereichs,
der
Fakultät) erforderlichen Exemplar für die Archivierung drei bis sechs Exemplare, die auf
alterungsbeständigem holz- und säurefreiem Papier ausgedruckt und dauerhaft haltbar
gebunden
sein müssen, unentgeltlich an die Hochschulbibliothek abliefert und darüber hinaus die
Verbreitung sicherstellt durch:
Entweder a) die Ablieferung weiterer Vervielfältigungen in den Geistes- und in den
Gesellschaftswissenschaften höchstens 80 Exemplare, in der Medizin, in den
Natur- und den Ingenieurwissenschaften höchstens 40 Exemplare, jeweils in
Buch- oder Fotodruck
oder b) den Nachweis der Veröffentlichung in einer Zeitschrift
oder c) den Nachweis einer Verbreitung über den Buchhandel durch einen gewerblichen
Verleger mit einer Mindestauflage von 150 Exemplaren;
auf der Rückseite des Titelblatts ist die Veröffentlichung als Dissertation unter
Angabe des Dissertationsortes auszuweisen
oder d) die Ablieferung eines Mikrofiches und bis zu 50 weiteren Kopien
oder e) durch die Ablieferung einer elektronischen Version, deren Datenformat und deren
Datenträger mit der Hochschulbibliothek abzustimmen sind.
Im Fall von a) sind die Hochschulbibliotheken verpflichtet, die überzähligen
Tauschexemplare
vier Jahre lang in angemessener Stückzahl aufzubewahren.
In den Fällen a), d) und e) überträgt der Doktorand der Hochschule das Recht, im Rahmen der
gesetzlichen Aufgaben der Hochschulbibliotheken weitere Kopien von seiner Dissertation
