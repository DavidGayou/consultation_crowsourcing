UK response to European Commission
consultation December 2013:
Review of the EU Copyright Rules

                                  UK response to European Commission consultation December 2013




Foreword
Copyright plays a key role in the European economy, offering incentives and rewards
to creators and the creative industries, and supporting investment in new content and
services. It also has an important role in the wider Single Market, as the EU seeks to
encourage a dynamic digital economy which promotes innovation and economic growth.

Because of this, a fit-for-purpose copyright regime is essential to completing the Digital
Single Market in Europe, and the Commission’s interest in this is welcome. The European
debate should focus on ensuring that the EU copyright framework is fit for the digital era
and maximises the potential for growth across the EU.

To achieve this, the copyright framework needs to be flexible, modern and robust. It
needs to protect the rights and interests of creators, while meeting the demands and
needs of end users and consumers. It needs to reflect the importance of creativity and
culture to our society, as well as the wider public interest in access to information and
knowledge.

In light of this, and the often technical and complex nature of copyright policy, the
UK Government notes the relatively short timeframe initially set for response to this
consultation. The important questions it raises require careful and thorough analysis of
the available evidence. The UK therefore welcomes the Commission’s extension of the
deadline for comments to 5 March. Member States, businesses and individuals must also
be given adequate opportunity to contribute and engage fully in any future development
of this work.

The United Kingdom strongly believes that any potential future proposals to update
European copyright law should be built on a robust evidence base, should be
technologically neutral, and would need to protect the rights of creators as well as
encouraging new businesses and services.

Comments on specific issues, in line with these overall views, are given below.



II.A Cross-border portability
The UK would welcome action that increased the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring continued protection for right holders.
This could come about via market-led licensing arrangements. The UK welcomes the
contribution already made by the CRM Directive, and suggests that action in other
sectors might follow similar principles. The UK is not convinced that specific actions that
will enhance content availability across borders at EU level have yet been identified, but
agrees that this is a suitable area for discussion.

In respect of territorial licensing the UK previously responded to the “Green Paper on
the online distribution of audiovisual works in the European Union: opportunities and
challenges towards a Digital Single Market, COM (2011) 427 final” in 2011.  In summary,
in its response the UK emphasised the importance of broadcasting and sport, culture
and the economy.  It highlighted the need to consider the complex interactions between
intellectual property rights based on territorial licensing, competition and the Single
Market.



II.B Digital transmissions
The UK notes that a number of the questions asked under this section appear to be
adequately addressed by the existing copyright framework and a number are currently
being considered by the Court of Justice.

UK stakeholders have not raised with the UK Government any specific problems
in relation to the issue of two rights being applicable to a single act of economic
exploitation. In some situations, such as where a download is provided, necessary
reproduction will usually be permitted under an express or implied licence. In other
situations, such as the lawful reception of broadcasts, necessary temporary reproductions
will be permitted under the temporary copying exception (Infosoc Article 5(1)). While
copyright licensing can sometimes be complex, this issue is not among the main issues
UK stakeholders cite as causing this complexity.

As the consultation notes, a number of questions concerning whether or not the provision
of hyperlinks should be subject to the authorisation of right holders have been referred to
the Court of Justice. As a hyperlink is little more than a pointer to where content can be
found, much like a reference in an index, it seems clear to the UK that mere provision of
a hyperlink is not a communication to the public of that work. As such, it should not be
subject to the authorisation of right holders. The UK therefore welcomes the finding of the
recent Svensson case (C-466 / 12) that “the provision on a website of clickable links to
works freely available on another website does not constitute an ‘act of communication to
the public’”.

A requirement to seek permission for linking to copyright works would be excessively
burdensome for users of the internet, including European businesses. However, it is
important that the law supports efforts to tackle online copyright infringement, to which
the UK remains committed. It is important for the interests of right holders that the law
continues to forbid systematic provision of links that are known to lead to infringing
content. In the UK this is done partly outside the copyright code, through fraud offences
for example.

The applicability of the temporary copying exception to internet browsing is another
question being considered by the ECJ. It seems clear to the UK that the making of
temporary copies during the course of browsing (whether on the screen or in a cache)
fall within this exception. Right holders have the option of putting such content behind a
paywall or applying other technological restrictions if they wish to control access to it.

As regards the resale of copies, the UK notes that traditional secondary markets for
goods can encourage both initial purchase and adoption of technologies, and the
prospect of sale on the secondary market may be factored in to an initial decision to
buy and to market prices. There seems to be no reason why this should not be the case
for digital copies, except for the “forward and delete” issue noted by the consultation.
Because of this issue, a sophisticated analysis of the overall economic implications of
digital resale markets is required, and this would be an area suitable for further research.



II.C Registration
Registration systems can have a useful role in the identification and licensing of works.
The potential benefits can include easier licensing at lower transaction cost and better
information about the availability and ownership of works, which should lead to more
efficient markets in licences.

However, registers should be provided on a voluntary basis, and registration should not
become a de facto formality.

When incentives for voluntary registration were proposed by the UK’s Hargreaves Review
in 2011 there were strong views from right holders against any form of incentive structure
that gave registered works additional protections. Right holders wanted protections to be
given to all without condition, in order to avoid a two-tier copyright system evolving.

It is for this reason that the UK has supported the industry development of a voluntary
Digital Copyright Hub. This initiative aims to facilitate the link up of existing databases of
ownership information and improve the technology for automated licensing (for example
by supporting the adoption of metadata which contains ownership information). The UK
also welcomes initiatives such as the Global Repertoire Database which aim to improve
the recording and interchange of ownership information.

We also note that considerable infrastructure would be needed to support a single central
register, and demand for such a register is unclear.



II.D ‘Identifiers’ for works
The EU should encourage development of strong, open standards for identifiers and other
metadata. These standards should ideally reflect the information requirements of both
licensors and licensees, including those licensing by means such as Creative Commons
licences or the UK Government’s own Open Government Licence. The UK wants to
see licensing based on linked rights information platforms, such as the UK’s business-
led Copyright Hub, but sees this as most likely to develop by industry agreement. EU
or Member State intervention may not be required. Indeed, the UK suggests that any
prospect of legislation in this area may well impair rather than encourage the development
of viable commercial platforms and standards.



                                                                                                 3

II.E Term
A key function of copyright and related rights is to incentivise the creation and distribution
of copyright works, and copyright terms should be set to encourage this, without being
longer than is justified. It is therefore important that any decisions to extend or reduce
terms of protection are informed by robust economic evidence, and are consistent with
international obligations.



III. Limitations and exceptions
Limitations and exceptions are an important part of the copyright framework. They
provide space and flexibility within copyright law which enable it to take account of
the wider public interest, including the needs of innovative businesses, consumers,
cultural institutions, researchers and teachers. The flexibility currently provided by the
Infosoc Directive is helpful as it means Member States are able to update their laws
to keep pace with technological change, and to do so in a way that meets their own
national circumstances. The three-step test, which sets a boundary to all exceptions and
limitations, helps to ensure that copyright remains able to incentivise the creation of new
works and protects the rights of creators.

Many UK stakeholders have told us they value the territoriality of exceptions and
limitations, and have stressed the importance of the three-step test. Where there are clear
problems with cross-border use of copyright works, the EU should look at how these can
be overcome, but the importance of territoriality and the role of limitations and exceptions
in meeting national and European policy objectives should not be overlooked. For these
reasons, while the UK recognises the benefit of clear EU principles in this area, such as
those provided by the three-step test, the UK does not believe there is a case for full
harmonisation. If specific problems are identified, consideration should be given to the
scope for licensing to solve these issues as well as any case for legislation.

Where cross-border problems are identified, any response should be proportionate and
may not require legislative change. For example, problems created by private copying
levies may be best addressed by encouraging new approaches to fair compensation in
Europe, and allowing countries which pursue different approaches to continue to do so,
rather than seeking to harmonise levies. Comments on specific policy areas are given
below.

Technological innovation continues apace, affecting many aspects of our lives, and
enabling copyright content and services to be provided in new ways. The EU needs to
find ways to respond to this whilst maintaining adequate certainty for market players and
protection for creators.

The UK believes a degree of flexibility in copyright exceptions is desirable in meeting
these challenges. This should explicitly remain within the scope of the three-step test,
which offers important protection for creators and right holders. A fixed list of mandatory,
harmonised exceptions would not seem to be the best way to ensure such flexibility.

The UK would have concerns about a completely open “fair use” approach, which is likely
to require the ECJ to rule on a case-by-case basis. The ECJ has done much to clarify the
principles underlying the current copyright framework, but it is not an appropriate court to
rule on fact-specific cases. Nor should it become a de facto copyright law-making body.

On the other hand, the UK recognises the benefit of taking a flexible approach to the
scope of certain limitations and exceptions at national level, where national courts are
able to weigh the facts and evidence in any case. The UK’s “fair dealing” exceptions
are a case in point. The ability for Member States to provide such exceptions should be
maintained.

Periodic revisions of the Directives are valuable as ways to consolidate emerging
European consensus, but by their nature are unable to provide a rapid response to
emerging issues.

We should also not lose sight of the fact that exceptions and limitations, though an
important and integral part of copyright, are only one means through which the copyright
framework can promote creativity and investment in the creative industries without
unduly restricting innovation and investment in new technologies. Efficient licensing
solutions also play an important role, as do other (non-exception) boundaries to copyright
protection, such as the principle that copyright protects original creations and their
expression, rather than facts and ideas. The question of whether or not exceptions are
justified in specific cases should be considered within this broader context, and it should
not be assumed that exceptions are the solution to every problem.



III.A Libraries and archives
The UK is currently updating its preservation exceptions in line with the Directive to permit
preservation copying of all types of media. Carefully-defined preservation exceptions
have clear benefits, by helping archives, museums and libraries maintain our cultural
heritage for the enjoyment of future generations. However the extent to which there is a
cross-border problem in relation to preservation copying is unclear, and the Single Market
case for or against harmonisation should be considered in the context of such evidence.

In general, it is important that exceptions which are provided for the benefit of cultural
institutions and the public who use them are applicable to the wide range of media held
by those institutions, without undermining markets in copyright works. The UK is currently
updating its range of exceptions which apply to cultural institutions on this basis,
including those which allow limited copying by libraries and archives for the purposes of
research and private study.

Were the consultation to reveal significant cross-border barriers to the use of copyright
materials by cultural institutions, we agree that this is an area which should be considered
for future work, and the merits of licensing and legislative solutions should be explored.




                                                                                             5
UK response to European Commission consultation December 2013




On the subject of e-lending, the UK notes that exceptions may be provided for public
lending of ebooks, to the extent that this takes place on the premises of public libraries,
within the current legal framework, as long as copyright owners are appropriately
remunerated.



III.B Teaching
The UK is currently updating its exceptions for teaching and education, so that they
will apply to all types of media and can be used with all types of technology. Like many
Member States, the UK copyright framework supports the use of copyright materials
in education through a mix of narrow uncompensated exceptions, wider remunerated
exceptions (remuneration being provided through licensing schemes) and through
copyright licensing more generally.

UK licensing bodies are taking forward their own initiatives to simplify copyright licensing.
The recent Hooper report on copyright licensing noted that 12 different licensing
organisations issue copyright licences to UK schools, and 10 issue licences to the UK
further education sector. In response, licensing bodies in the UK have already taken steps
to make it easier for schools, colleges and universities to access copyright licences, and
to simplify their number and operation.

The UK would wish to encourage other Member States to take a technology and media-
neutral approach to exceptions and limitations for education and teaching, and to
encourage efficient licensing in this sector. There does not appear to be a prima facie
case for harmonising national rules, but the UK Government would wish to consider
specific proposals on their merits, within the context of the Single Market.

A particular area which may be of cross-border relevance is the use of distance-learning
technology which enables universities and colleges in one Member State to provide
courses to students throughout the EU. It is important that copyright rules do not hinder
cross-border provision of courses in the EU. The UK is currently updating its national
educational exceptions, which work in conjunction with collective licences, to permit
copying for the purpose of distance learning while ensuring creators are remunerated for
this use. Should the Commission identify a need for action in this area, it is important that
creators continue to be fairly remunerated and licensing solutions should be explored
alongside changes to the legislative framework.

III.C Research
As with other exceptions, the UK is currently updating its existing research exceptions
so that they apply to all types of work and media. This is in response to concerns that
the existing exceptions, which only apply to certain types of work, do not offer benefits
to researchers operating in fields where they need to make use of sound recordings,
films or broadcasts. The UK’s research exceptions are based on a “fair dealing” principle,
which means that they only apply to reasonable uses of copyright works which do not
unreasonably prejudice the interests of right holders.

The UK Government’s Open Access policy, as being implemented by Research Councils
UK, requires that publicly funded published research should preferably be made available
on a Gold Open Access basis, or alternatively by way of Green Open Access. The result
should be greater access to the content of published research.



III.D Disabilities
The UK recognises that copyright may pose a barrier to organisations and individuals
which seek to provide accessible copies of works to disabled people. Because of the
particular problems faced by visually impaired people who wish to read books and other
literary works, the UK provides exceptions to copyright allowing accessible copies to be
made for visually impaired people, where such copies are not available on the market.
The UK is currently in the process of updating these provisions so that they will benefit
all people who have a disability which prevents them accessing creative works, in any
medium.

The UK has also been an advocate of work at international level to make it easier for
visually impaired people around the world to obtain copies of books in accessible
formats: work which led to agreement of the Marrakech Treaty in June 2013. This Treaty
will benefit visually impaired people in European Member States as well as those in
countries around the world, and steps should be taken to ensure it enters into force as
soon as possible. When implementing the Treaty, and when considering other cross-
border action in this area, it is important that Member States retain their ability to choose
how they meet the requirements of the three step test, in accordance with their national
traditions. This may include the provision of remuneration to right holders or limitation of
the exception to cases where commercial copies are unavailable. This latter approach,
which is favoured by the UK, allows the making of accessible copies where necessary,
while also incentivising the provision of accessible copies by copyright owners.




                                                                                             7

III.E Text & data mining
It is important to the advancement of science and the growth of an innovation-led
economy to enable researchers to make full use of the huge amount of information that
is now available and is ever increasing. Text and data mining technology makes it much
easier to analyse large quantities of information. However, as these technologies typically
work by bulk copying entire copyright works, copyright may be infringed unless specific
permission for each work is obtained. This can act as an insurmountable obstacle to
research.

The copyright system should not unduly restrict the ability of researchers to use text and
data mining techniques. Copyright does not protect information as such, and the copying
involved in text and data mining is a necessary part of a technological process, which
does not substitute for the work in question.

Licensing schemes are clearly important for some uses, particularly where they involve
value-added services by content providers, but may not overcome the problems of
negotiating large numbers of individual permissions or encourage the development and
adoption of new TDM techniques to the fullest possible extent. Therefore, exceptions
should be considered as appropriate means to permit this activity, as well as licences.

The UK is taking an exceptions-based approach in its national law. To encourage the use
of text and data mining techniques in research, the UK intends to introduce a specific
copyright exception for this purpose, within the scope of Article 5(3)(a) of the Infosoc
Directive.

However, any exceptions should not remove the scope for content providers to offer
value-added services under licence. They should not give people free access to works
that they would otherwise not have access to. Nor should they prevent publishers from
applying technological measures to networks when necessary to maintain security or
stability.

Alongside these planned legislative measures, the UK policy on Open Access requires
that material published under the Gold Open Access route be published under a CC-BY
licence which permits all re-use including text and data mining.

As to the question of whether EU-level action is required in this area, and how any cross-
border problems would best be solved, the UK looks forward to considering the evidence
arising from this consultation process and to discussing national experiences with other
Member States. Any action should be based on a full consideration of the evidence and
the impact of any solutions on the Single Market, recognising the benefits that text and
data mining can offer research.

III.F User-generated content
The consultation recognises that it is not always clear what is, and is not allowed
under platform-wide licences covering user generated content (for example videos
posted on YouTube). The UK has also heard that consumers can be unsure about how
copyright rules apply to User Generated Content more generally. The UK believes more
transparency for users regarding blanket licensing arrangements for UGC platforms would
be useful, as would a focus on educating users and creators of UGC about copyright
rules more broadly. As the recent EU stakeholder dialogue found, the case for any other
regulatory intervention in this area remains to be made.



IV. Private copying and reprography
The Infosoc Directive provides flexibility for Member States to choose whether or not, and
to what extent, to allow reprographic copying and copying for private use. It also allows
flexibility for Member States to choose how to provide any compensation that may need
to be provided as a result of such exceptions.

The UK supports the optional nature of these exceptions, and agrees that right holders
should receive fair compensation where such copying unreasonably prejudices the
legitimate interests of the rights holder. This is more likely to be the case where such
exceptions permit copying among friends and family, which could displace sales to those
people. While the UK respects the right of other Member States to provide compensation
in accordance with their national circumstances, it notes that national levy schemes are
only one way to achieve this compensation, and other approaches, such as licensing, are
possible.

The UK considers that private copying levies in general are inefficient, burdensome to
administer, and unfair to consumers. The UK does not have, and does not intend to
introduce, private copying levies, and does not believe that full EU harmonisation of levy
systems would be desirable. However it recognises that alignment of laws or procedures
between Member States which do provide levies – such as a common approach to
cross-border sales of levied products – could have benefits. Were such an objective to be
pursued, it should not interfere with the right of Member States to provide alternatives to
levy systems, including licences, taxes, and de minimis exceptions.

Where private copying and reprographic copying causes only minimal harm, including
where adequate payment has already been received for the copying in question, no
compensation is necessary. In particular, where a work has been licensed, no additional
compensation should be expected or required. An example of this is mentioned in the
consultation, where a digital download is sold to a consumer, and the consumer expects
to copy that download in order to use it. Such copying will be factored in at the point of
purchase.




                                                                                             9
UK response to European Commission consultation December 2013




The scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions appears to
be reasonably clear, and as the exceptions already apply in the digital environment there
is no obvious need to amend them. A number of questions currently being considered by
the ECJ may have a bearing on the extent to which Member States’ flexibility in this area
can be exercised, which in turn may make it necessary for the EU to clarify the law.

The EU should be seeking to reduce red tape on businesses, not to increase it, so the
UK would not support measures which would make the administration of levy systems
even more burdensome. While the UK recognises that there are problems in cross-border
situations where levies are charged twice in different Member States, and that action in
this area may be appropriate, any attempt to address this should not impact on Member
States which do not have levy systems.



V. Fair remuneration in contracts
The topic of fair remuneration in contracts is an important one. However, the UK
considers it to be primarily a matter for national contract law and so should be beyond
the scope of this consultation. Any consideration of this issue should be based on a clear
understanding of the nature of the problem and its scale, the extent to which the problem
is unique to copyright contracts, and whether it is an impediment to the Digital Single
Market.



VI. Respect for rights
While the UK would welcome genuine improvements to the efficiency of civil enforcement,
it believes that existing legal mechanisms are working as well as can be expected. It is
clear and sets a reasonable balance between the responsibilities of all parties.

The UK agrees that a focus on intermediaries is appropriate but believes voluntary action
should always be considered first, and may offer a better prospect of success in tackling
infringement than legislation that will inevitably take time to develop and is likely to date
rapidly.



VII. A single EU copyright title
As this consultation shows, there are many complex issues which would need to be
resolved before a single copyright title could be a realistic prospect. Nor has the case for
one yet been made.

With so many individuals and businesses reliant on and affected by copyright, and with
so many contentious issues at stake, it would be unwise for the Commission to rush into
any changes of this scale or ambition.
