Preliminary observations

The protection of the author’s literary and artistic property is an achievement of the
Enlightenment. Thanks to the enthusiasm of Beaumarchais and innovative thinkers like
Locke, Pütter, Kant and Hegel, to name but a few, copyright could replace the system of
privileges whose grant often depended on the taste and political preferences of the sovereign.
Thus, apart from securing financial rewards through a proprietary right, copyright also created
a space where authors could work, think and express themselves freely. One should not lose
sight of this important achievement which doubtless contributed to the diversity of our
European cultural heritage when subjecting copyright to a contemporary fitness test.

From its beginnings to this day, copyright has nurtured and supported authors and encouraged
them to make use of their skills and talent for the enrichment and inspiration of society.
Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) reflects the intrinsic
relationship between the creative efforts of the author and the benefits which accrue to society
as a whole: while Article 27(1) UDHR provides everyone with the right to participate freely
in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement
and benefits, Article 27(2) UDHR protects at the same time the moral and material interests of
the author from any scientific, literary or artistic production. By uniting the competing
interests of the creator and the user under one roof, Article 27 UDHR invites for an adequate
balance to be struck between the two interests.

Modern copyright and its later cousin related rights have been constantly developed over time
to take account of changing circumstances. The delicate balance between the interests of the
creator and of the user has been continuously adjusted in the light of technological
developments by legislators and courts, both at the European and at the national level. Thus,
one of the objectives of the Directive governing copyright in the information society
(2001/29/EC) is to safeguard a fair balance of rights and interests between the different
categories of rightholders and users of protected subject-matter (Rec. 31), thereby honouring
the principles enshrined in Article 27 UDHR as well as in Article 15(1) of the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Nevertheless, the European Commission appears to have some doubts as to whether the
existing legal framework is still fit for purpose in the light of the challenges which the new
technological environment poses. In view of the indefatigable efforts of the European Court
of Justice to take the existing legal framework into the 21st century and the various initiatives
organised by the European Commission itself, such as the recently concluded stakeholder
dialogue on “Licences for Europe”, it is however questionable whether there is presently a
need for legislative action in the field of copyright and related rights. A look at the core
features of copyright protection in Europe should suffice to demonstrate that current
developments at the court level, the measures agreed upon in the stakeholder dialogue and
legislation adopted recently by the European legislator render legislative action at this stage
dispensable.

I.     Territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
       segmentation of the market through licensing agreements (Q 1-7)

As far as the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market is concerned, it
is worth noting that never in the history of copyright has there been such an abundant and
diverse availability of works and other protected subject-matter in Europe, both at the national

                                                                                               3
level and across borders. If there are indeed issues with accessing individual online services
across borders, then this should be preferably addressed through the shaping of licensing
practices. As already indicated, the Commission itself has already taken a number of
initiatives to redress potential problems concerning cross-border access, for example through
the stakeholder dialogue on “Licences in Europe” or the rules governing multi-territorial
licences in musical works for online services in the Directive on Collective Rights
Management which has just been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. Much
effort has gone into these initiatives and the agreed measures should be given a chance to be
implemented and their effects and implications to be assessed over time.

II.     The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions (Q 8-12)

Likewise, there does not appear to be a need for clarifying the scope of rights. As is well
known, the making available right as laid down in Article 8 WCT and subsequently in Article
3 of Directive 2001/29/EC goes back to a proposal tabled by the European Communities in
May 1996 for the 7th Session of the Committee of Experts on a Possible Protocol to the Berne
Convention at the World Intellectual Property Organisation. According to the proposal, the
concept of “making available” is to be understood as the making available to the public of
works, “by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access these
works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them”1. Thus, the making available
right was conceived as part of the communication to the public right coupled with elements
from the distribution right. At the session, the Delegation of the European
Communities explained the scope of its proposal and clarified that “for the completion of the
act of communication to the public, it would not be required that an actual transmission takes
place; for this the mere making available of works to the public (for example the uploading of
a work to a bulletin board) for subsequent transmission would be sufficient. The Delegation
stressed that the phrase "from a place and at a time individually chosen by the members of the
public" clarified both the concept of "public" and the fact that on-demand uses are
covered”2. Hence the transmission of the work to the user, although being part of the right,
does not need to take place for making available to occur.

The formula of the making available right used in Article 3 Directive 2001/29/EC is the same
as the initial proposal made by the delegation of the European Communities and the adopted
text in Article 8 WCT. Thus, it follows from the legal history and the wording of the provision
that making available covers both the offer to the public and the subsequent transmission3. As
a consequence, this double-act right may lead to a situation where making available occurs at
the place where the offer is made and where it may be accessed and received. The European
Court of Justice has not only confirmed the broad notion of the communication to the public
right on a number of occasions4, but also the fact that making available can well take place in
the country where the user accesses and receives on his computer an offer of data made
available from another country5. The territorial scope of the making available right is thus not

should however bring clarity also in more general terms.

only implicitly clear from the legislative history and the wording of the provision, but has also
received confirmation by the Court of Justice.

Moreover, the fact that the use of a work in a digital network, such as in a download service,
would involve both the right of communication to the public and the reproduction right would
not appear to pose a particular threat for the further development of digital services in the
Single Market either. In fact, there is nothing new about the application of two rights in a
“single act of exploitation”: the sale of a CD touches both upon the reproduction and on the
distribution right, just like a broadcast of a work may involve the broadcasting and the
reproduction right. Why should such a situation create a particular problem in the online
environment?

Pointing to the activities of the European Court of Justice, it does also not seem necessary or
timely to embark on a clarification of the concept of linking. The recent judgment of the Court
in the Svensson case has clarified that linking constitutes an act of communication which,
under certain circumstances, may be considered to be made to the public6. Two pending
references in the Bestwater International and C-More Entertainment cases will determine the
legal treatment of hyperlinks further7. The same is true with regard to browsing where the
Court of Justice has been called upon by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in the so-
called Meltwater case8.

III.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market (Q 21-27)

The exhaustive and largely optional catalogue in Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC consisting
of 20 limitations and exceptions may have given rise to criticism. Yet, in view of the
difficulties faced by the European legislator as a result of the substantial differences in the
legal regimes regarding limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights in place at the national
level, this concept appeared as the most promising way forward to achieve legal certainty
without upsetting the diverse and organically grown systems in the national laws at Member
State level9. The parameters remain the same and the problems that the drafters of the 2001
Directive faced have not gone away. Against this background, the carefully designed structure
and concept underlying Article 5 of the Directive appears still apt to safeguard the balance
advocated in Recital 31 by granting Member States a degree of flexibility to maintain and/or
implement limitations and exceptions in accordance with their own legal systems whilst
guaranteeing an adequate level of protection for authors and other rightholders.

VII.     A single EU Copyright Title (Q 78 and 79)

There are fundamental differences in the individual systems of protection of copyright and
related rights at Member State level. Not only is there a divide between the Common Law
systems and the continental-European traditions, substantial differences occur also within
these systems. As such, some features in the French Law on Author’s Right differ from those
in German law almost as much as they differ from the Common Law system. In addition, the
rules on copyright and related rights in the Member States often relate to and are

supplemented by other legal concepts, such as contract law, torts or property law, which are
equally diverse in the 28 Member States.

Against this background, the harmonisation in the area of copyright and related rights
undertaken by the European legislator since 1991 is a remarkable achievement. It has created
a flexible legal regime with a high level of protection which bridges the dogmatic divide and
allows Member States to comply with the European copyright acquis whilst maintaining their
own legal systems and traditions.

A single EU Copyright Title which would totally harmonise copyright law in the EU and
replace the national systems with whatever the European legislator would be able to adopt
would require to depart with this flexibility. A single European Copyright Title or Code
would necessitate the full harmonisation in all areas of copyright and related rights law,
including those which could so far not be tackled, be it for ideological or for practical reasons.
These include moral rights, authorship (except for cinematographic works), ownership and
transfer of rights as well as a fully harmonised catalogue of limitations and exceptions. The
attempt to cultivate such a thorny terrain seems more utopian than realistic.

Such an undertaking would further raise concerns with regard to competence and the principle
of subsidiarity. In view of the diverging systems and practice in the 28 Member States, there
is a risk that a single EU Copyright Title or Code, if it could ever be agreed, might only result
in the adoption of the lowest common denominator, contrary to what has been achieved so far
at the European level which has been essentially an upward harmonisation. This could have
serious repercussions at the national level, as it might lead to lower standards of protection in
some Member States. As the European legal order protects copyright also under the
fundamental right to property in Article 17.2 of the European Charter on Fundamental Rights,
any expropriation as a result of the introduction of a unitary title would have to be addressed
by the EU and its Member States. The process would thus require remedying measures, for
example transitional provisions which would defer the effect of the intended harmonisation
for a very long time or supplementary rules at the national level alongside the EU title or
Code which would equally render the effect of immediate unification obsolete. The
establishment of a single EU Copyright Title whose benefits are in any event more than
doubtful would therefore represent a rather unrealistic adventure.

Conclusion

In conclusion, it follows from the foregoing that there is presently no urgency to modernise
the European copyright acquis through legislation. Rather, the European Commission could
usefully monitor the implementation of the various measures agreed at the European level.
This would give the adopted measures a chance to mature and prove themselves in practice
instead of being immediately rendered obsolete by superseding legislation.

There are also some less intrusive measures on which the European Commission could
usefully embark. Since 1991, the EU legislator has adopted various directives which regulate
or touch upon the area of copyright and related rights. These directives appear to live
peacefully next to each other; however their relationship is not always clear and
inconsistencies may be found. It could therefore be useful to consolidate the various directives
in the copyright and related rights field, clarify their relationship and eliminate editorial
inconsistencies.

In addition, it would be helpful to compile the abundant case law issued by the European
Court of Justice in relation to each directive and thus to facilitate the interpretation and
application of EU law at the national level.

Finally, the creation of a database at EU level consisting of national instruments which
implement the various EU directives in the copyright and related rights field at the national
level together with a continuously updated version of the applicable national copyright law,
preferably in the original language with at least an English translation, would be of great
assistance. Most directives contain rules regarding the communication of implementing
legislation by the Member States to the Commission. It should therefore not be too onerous on
the European Commission to compile such a database and to make it available for use by the
general public.

Such measures could greatly further the understanding and the application of the European
copyright acquis.
