   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[1].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[2] should significantly facilitate the delivery of  multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for   online   services[3];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue  “Licences  for  Europe”[4]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[5].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[6].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[7]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


A  great  part  of  the  socio-economic,  humanities   and   arts   research
increasingly depends on the availability of on-line content and data,  which
is used in a variety of  complex  and  often  unexpected  ways.  Content  is
useful both as textual or audio-visual material that is being used  for  its
informational value (e.g. the actual informational  content  of  a  text  or
audiovisual material which is used as  a  resource  for  the  conducting  of
research) but also as primary material useful for the development  of  value
added services (e.g. Machine Training for Translation,  Language  Resources-
based services etc). In both  cases,  the  fragmentation  of  legal  (mostly
copyright) regimes, of collecting societies  and  individual  rights  owners
creates artificial boundaries in the use of or re-use  of  such  content.  A
number of issues relate to such problems:


(a) it is not clear what the applicable law is


(b) as a result of (a), it  is  not  clear  what  the  applicable  range  of
copyright limitations and exceptions is.  Limitations  and  exceptions  that
are LR specific are crucial since the existing limitations  assume  a  human
being rather than a machine as the recipient of  the  information.  New  and
wider as well as more harmonised limitations and exceptions are needed.


(c) it is not clear what the orphan works  status  is.  The  new  Collecting
Societies Directive is difficult in its  implementation  as  [i]  it  has  a
reduced scope and does not cover all types of works  and  [ii]  it  requires
databases with rights information that in many Member  States  jurisdictions
do not exist. In addition, the implementation of the Directive in  a  number
of MS requires  the  development  of  databases  that  will  take  years  to
complete and may lead to  presumptions  regarding  ownership  that  may  not
reflect reality


(d) even when the rights-owners are known, it may be the case that there  is
fragmentation at two levels: [i] collecting societies often  do  not  manage
re-use rights and hence it is difficult to centrally  obtain  the  necessary
rights [ii] multiple collecting societies  may  manage  different  types  of
rights (e.g. authors’ vs performers’ rights)  and,  as  a  result,  multiple
licences may be required [iii] there are no  collecting  societies  for  the
desired subject matter (e.g. website  based  content)  [iv}  the  collecting
societies market is highly territorial and fragmented irrespective of  their
bilateral or multilateral agreements.


(e) Public Domain rules are not harmonised or clear. This means that  it  is
not possible to securely re-use content across the union. In  addition,  the
question of digitisation and whether this  re-introduces  PD  works  into  a
copyright protected regime is unclear in a number of jurisdictions.





(f) Rights Documentation in all types of EU funded or EU/ Member  State  co-
funded projects is extremely poor and not standardised. As a  result  it  is
difficult to crawl licensing meta-data and as result understand  what  works
are and what not copyrighted or under which conditions  are  they  licensed.
This is even a greater problem in the case of simple web-sites  where  there
is no easy way to identify the licence they are provided under.





(g) in both cases (e) and (f),  the  absence  of  a  PD  by  default  and  ©
registration system creates a presumption of All Rights Reserved  and  hence
by default increases transaction costs for information re-users.


   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).





Heal-Link provides a wide variety of services and  resources  (or  resources
through services) both to  End-  and  Business  /  Academic  (institutional)
users. Depending on whether the service is  provided  to  a  natural  person
(end user) or a legal entity (institutional user) often means that there  is
a  different  legal  framework  applicable  (e.g.  consumer  protection  vs.
commercial law). While the  e-commerce  Directive  contributes  to  a  great
degree to the harmonization of  the  relevant  legal  regimes,  there  still
remain  substantial  differences  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  with
regards to liability and the extent to which disclaimers operate.


However, the greatest problem relates to the status  of  the  data/  content
that is provided  through  the  online  services.  This  inherently  has  to
address both the problems  of  clearance  of  the  source-material  and  the
question of  whether  the  licensing-out  (aka  the  licensing  to  end  and
institutional users) will take place through an  individual  institution  or
through some form of collective management institution.


With regards to the clearance issue, all problems presented in question  (1)
also pertain here. The uncertain legal status of the content and  data  that
constitutes the source material, often leads to the following practices:


(a) The Research Performing Organisation decides either not to  license  out
content/ data at all and as a result significantly reducing  or  eliminating
any value added to the original content by the would  be  distributor:  e.g.
the content that has been cleared and  enriched  by  a  Research  Performing
Organisation (RPO) and which is based on legally “grey” material, will  most
probably stay with the RPO and never make its way out.


(b) the legally “grey” material contaminates the value  added  material  but
still the RPO decided to take the legal risk and release the enriched  data/
content: as a result we have a proliferation of legally  uncertain  material
that after a point is not possible to be cleared (or it is too expensive  to
be cleared) by a potential business;


(c) the legally “grey” material is never  released  itself,  but  rather  an
online service based on it, effectively making it non-accessible as such  by
other institutions or individuals  (e.g.  a  corpus  is  used  in  order  to
provide a Machine Translation service).


With regards to the way in which such material may be  licensed,  three  are
the main problems:


(a)  it  is  not  clear  what  licence  is  the  most  appropriate  for  the
organization holding the LR. As a result, it could be that  the  RPO  offers
the content under a licence that is not easily combined with other  licences
and causes licensing pollution (e.g. a non-standard copyleft  licence).  The
problem may be compensated  with  the  use  of  standard  licences  and  the
issuing of guidelines as to how the licensing may be  most  effectively  and
efficiently made in the image of the Open Data for Open Gov guides.


(b) it is very likely that  a  single  organization  will  not  be  able  to
enforce  rights  across  jurisdictions  and  the  LR  collective  management
structures are  fairly  limited  and  cannot  be  classified  as  Collecting
Societies  or  Enforcement  Agency  under  most  of  the  jurisdictions.  In
addition, there is dire need for a Collecting Society or Enforcement  Agency
willing to legally enforce open licences as  well  as  All  Rights  Reserved
licences. Agencies, such as ELRA/ELDA could under  conditions  play  such  a
role.


(c) unless there is use of a standard public (aka open) licence, it is  very
likely that multiple  licence  agreements  will  be  required  in  order  to
address the individuality of not only copyright but contract law  system  in
different member states.





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


All licences used in the context of the LR/LT  and  MT  infrastructures  are
multi-territorial licences as they do  not  limit  themselves  in  a  single
Member State or even blocks of jurisdictions, such as the EU. Such  requests
are in the range of thousands per year in  terms  of  individual  uses  (and
sometimes users). However, increasing the volume of licensing activities  is
directly proportional to the openness and standardization of  the  licences.
The more open the licences the greater the reuse capacity  of  the  LR.  The
content is of all types but  mostly  text-related  data,  though  audio  and
audiovisual content is increasing in popularity.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


[Open question]

There is a number of measures suggested that are  directly  matched  to  the
issues identified. The rule for the entirety of the suggestions made  should
be the reduction of  transaction  costs  in  the  re-use  of  material.  The
suggestions vary from legislative  reform  suggestions  to  soft  rules  and
codes of conduct (CoCs) that could be implemented in multiple areas.

More specifically:
 - Active measures for the harmonization of the public domain  clauses  need
   to be taken. In particular, the balancing of the  Public  Domain  against
   Copyright has to be re-enforced, by introducing a positive and actionable
   right to Public Domain
 - Exceptions and limitations have to be doctrine rather than exclusive list
   based, similarly to the Fair Use doctrine. This  will  make  them  future
   proof and increase the scope of their application
 - In case none  of  the  above  is  possible,  it  is  necessary  that  all
   limitations and exceptions are harmonized in the EU level with particular
   emphasis on exceptions for research in general.
 - Codes of Conduct and Model open data/ access policies  for  all  publicly
   funded research and digitization projects have to be devised.
 - Licence-out Interoperability has to  be  a  condition  for  all  publicly
   funded projects
 - Legal documentation (in term  e.g.  of  licensing  metadata)  has  to  be
   obligatory for all publicly funded projects.
 - Public Sector Information (PSI) and Geodata licensing  out  harmonization
   should be effected either through legislation, regulations or  any  other
   means (e.g. CoCs)


   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ NO – Please explain by giving examples


Not as a matter of licensing policy. Only where there are legal reasons  for
limiting access, which are not the result of the will of  the  licensing-out
party but rather the result of:
 •  pre-existing  agreements   (e.g.   confidentiality   or   non-disclosure
   agreements)
 • personal data protection
 • trade secret agreements
 • national security issues


   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ No– Please explain by giving examples





See question (5).





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain





See answer in question (4)





Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established  by  Directive  2001/29/EC[8]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection  of  software[9]
and databases[10].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[11] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[12],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[13].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[14]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.





   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ NO


The ‘Study on the application  of  Directive  2001/29/EC  on  copyright  and
related rights in the information society’[15], prepared by  a  Belgian  law
firm De  Wolf  &  Partners  at  the  request  of  the  European  Commission,
identifies in its section on the ‘Study on the territoriality of the  making
available right - Localisation of the act of making available to the  public
and  its  consequences’  that  there  are  quite  a  few   bottlenecks   and
uncertainties.

The Study notably points out that:[16]
“The absence of a definition of the  making  available  right  creates  some
legal uncertainty as to the territorial reach of  the  online  accessibility
of protected subject matter. Different elements of this  complex  act  could
be considered relevant to establish the application of  the  national  right
of making available to the public: the  availability  on  a  server  or  the
transmission to a Member State, even  accessibility  of  the  work  has  not
explicitly been ruled out as a relevant element  for  the  making  available
right. Consequently if  all  Member  States  are  free  to  determine  which
element of the complex act  is  relevant  to  establish  an  act  of  making
available, then each could subject  this  constitutive  part  to  the  prior
authorisation of the author (and to the corresponding payment of  a  licence
fee). The Member States could define  the  same  or  different  criteria  to
apply their national making available right. At least in theory, this  would
lead to the accumulation of distinct acts  of  making  available  under  the
national  copyright  legislations  concerned   that   do   not   necessarily
correspond to  the  same  technical  and/or  economic  criteria.  Without  a
clarification of this restricted act, its relation to  the  other  exclusive
economic rights and  the  localisation  criterion,  it  remains  speculative
which facts will trigger an infringement and in which Member State.”

As a result, it concludes that, on the one hand  “the  exact  scope  of  the
making  available  right  (...)  is  not  clear”  and  on  the  other,  “the
territorial reach of the making available right is uncertain”.[17]

Looking at the specific case of cultural heritage institutions, we see  that
they are increasingly asked to provide access to  cultural  heritage  across
the entire EU. In  the  majority  of  cases  works  made  available  on  the
websites of cultural heritage and memory  institutions  are  made  available
without territorial restrictions. In this  situation  there  is  substantial
uncertainty about the scope of the  ‘making  available’  right  when  making
works available to audiences in all of Europe.

Given that cultural heritage and memory institutions have limited  resources
to spend on rights  clearance  the  only  acceptable  way  to  provide  more
clarity with regards to the scope of the ‘making available’ right  would  be
to apply a country of origin principle,[18] making sure that  the  scope  of
this principle is clearly defined and does not generate new bottlenecks.

HEAL-Link considers that an  approach  based  on  targeted  audiences  would
create  increased  burdens  since  dissemination  through   platforms   like
Europeana  is  explicitly  targeted  at  users  in  all  Member  States.[19]
Applying a  target  country  approach  would  make  it  more  difficult  for
cultural  heritage  institutions  to  make   their   works   available   via
international projects like Europeana.

The same is true more broadly for all  service  providers  and  institutions
making content available.




   9.  [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[20])?

HEAL-Link agrees with the ‘Study on the application of Directive  2001/29/EC
on copyright and related rights in the information society’, prepared  by  a
Belgian law firm  De  Wolf  &  Partners  at  the  request  of  the  European
Commission, which states that:[21]
“According to the Information Society Directive, the making available  right
is an exclusive right (art. 3(1)(2)), which entitles its owner to  authorise
or prohibit the restricted acts under this  right.  Broadly  speaking,  this
entails, on the one hand  the  right  holder’s  consent  should  be  cleared
before making the work available and, on the other hand, that  she  has  the
right to enforce it in case of  infringement.  Since  the  making  available
right may contain several constitutive elements that may take place  on  the
territories  of  several  Member  States,  divergent   national   rules   on
authorship and ownership may raise  complications,  in  particular  for  the
clearing of rights and for their enforcement.”

HEAL-Link believes that a clarification – through  the  application  of  the
country of origin  principle  –  would  reduce  the  type  of  complications
described in the study.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES





The  principle  that  should  be  followed  for  any  type   of   regulatory
intervention with regard  to  content  in  the  on-line  environment  should
follow the principle of minimizing transaction costs and  ensuring  seamless
re-use or –to that purpose- relicensing of the relevant content.


The existence of two rights on a single act, increase dramatically the  cost
in the online environment without any clear  justification  of  the  reasons
for the adoption of such a solution. More specifically,  rights  holder  may
be different for the two rights in multiple  jurisdictions  making  it  thus
impossible  or  very  expensive   to   clear   the   rights   for   multiple
jurisdictions, which is the normal situation with LRs reuse.


Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[22]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[23] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


Internet and hypertext mark-up are based on referring to  other  content  by
hyperlinking and thus any  move  that  limits  linking  would  be  extremely
detrimental to the digital market and free flow of  information.  There  are
better solutions for preventing  unwanted  linking,  e.g.  temporary  random
page names generated on demand.

The introduction of yet another restriction in the way in which  information
is linked will be contrary to the very nature of  the  Internet,  especially
web 2.0 and 3.0, and effectively kill not  only  commercial  but  also  non-
commercial activities. The widening  of  the  scope  of  copyright  is  also
likely  to  severely  disturb  the  already  problematic   balance   between
copyright and the public domain or the balance between existing  and  future
creators.

The  European  Copyright  Society,  comprised   of   independent   copyright
academics,  issued  an  opinion[24]  on  the  Svensson  case,  in  which  it
identifies three main reasons for this conclusion, summarised as follows  in
the ‘Study on the application  of  Directive  2001/29/EC  on  copyright  and
related rights in the information society’, prepared by a Belgian  law  firm
De Wolf & Partners at the request of the European Commission:[25]
“Firstly, it was contended that the right of  communication  to  the  public
requires a transmission that is absent when merely a hyperlink is  provided.
It is merely a location tool,  but  exists  independently  from  the  actual
availability of the work.  Secondly,  the  communication  should  address  a
public or a “new” public. The hyperlink does not extend the  public  of  the
work, published online: those who had access to  the  web  page  will  still
have access, those who did not have access (e.g. absent  the  payment  of  a
fee) will not gain access through the hyperlink.”

The European Copyright Society also argued that even if a  transmission  was
to be held not necessary for there  to  be  ‘communication’,  copyright  law
only catches communication of a ‘work’. A hyperlink is clearly not a  ‘work’
and as explained above, it is a location tool helping and allowing the  user
to find where a work is. In fact, a hyperlink cannot be equated with a  work
because works can be removed from the Internet at any time while  hyperlinks
remain intact.

The German Supreme Court came to the same  conclusion  in  the  Paperboy[26]
case stating that a search engine setting a  hyperlink  to  a  website  with
copyright-protected content which has already been  made  available  to  the
public by the rightholder does not infringe copyright law.  The  Court  made
clear that hyperlinks only refer to works facilitating access to them  which
has already been provided making them “no different  to  a  reference  to  a
print or to a website in the footnote of a publication”.[27] With regard  to
Article 3 of the InfoSoc Directive the  Court  unmistakably  concluded  that
the “setting of hyperlinks is not a communication in this sense”.[28]

In conclusion,  HEAL-Link  strongly  believes  that  providing  a  hyperlink
leading users to already publicly available material should not require  any
authorisation. Hyperlinking is a modern referencing tool  communicating  the
online addresses of works, not the works themselves.




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


Such use is covered by a mandatory copyright exception  under  art.  5.1  of
the Directive 2001/29/EC. A  different  solution  would  have  a  paralyzing
effect on the development of e-research infrastructures like  HEAL-Link  and
on  the  Internet  in  general;  it  would  also   contradict   social   and
technological norms.

Any material made available for viewing to a user,  either  free  or  for  a
fee, should be allowed to be cached on that user's computer for  the  user's
own personal viewing. This does not imply that the user  has  the  right  to
further  distribute  the  material.  Caching  for  personal  use  does   not
substantially infringe on the rights of the original right holder.

This  exception  would  have  to  be  complemented  by  a  broader  research
exception allowing not only the caching but also the  processing  of  online
content for research purposes and the  offering  of  related  non-commercial
purposes.

As pointed out by Christina Angelopoulos from the Institute for  Information
Law (IViR), asking this question amounts to asking ‘whether the Internet  is
Legal’.[29]  This  question  actually   shows   the   risks   of   extensive
interpretations and excessive legal claims.




Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[30].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[31].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


While  HEAL-Link  is  not  necessarily  an  organisation  involved  in   the
reselling of purchased digital files as such, it has  been  very  frequently
troubled by the limitations in fair use that  Technical  Protection  Measure
(TPM) impose as well as its ability to  perform  on  digital  artefacts  the
same acts as the ones that would perform in analogue ones.

Common  restrictions  on  digital  files   purchased   by   users   comprise
restrictions of back-up copies, restrictions as regards  the  conversion  to
other  formats,  limitations  of  compatibility  to  only  certain  devices,
technical impossibility to remix, etc..

A Europe Economics Study conducted  for  the  European  Commission  in  2011
notably found that:[32]
“Information  and  transparency  problems  relating  to   licensing   rules,
interoperability (i.e. degree  of  compatibility)  between  products  and/or
services and Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies  have  been  found
to  be  potential  sources  of  consumer  detriment  where   consumers   are
inadequately informed about how  these  are  applied  and  when,  which  may
result in consumers being unable to use  digital  content  and  services  in
accordance with their expectations. These  include,  for  example,  regional
coding imposed by DRM preventing DVDs being  played  in  different  regions;
the inability to use certain products or services together due to a lack  of
interoperability (such as transferring mobile phone  applications  from  one
model of phone to another);  and  differences  in  copyright  rules  between
tangible digital products and those accessed online, resulting in  consumers
expecting to be able to share online films in the same  way  as  they  share
tangible CDs.”

The circumvention of digital  restrictions  is  prohibited  by  the  InfoSoc
Directive, even when this circumvention is done in  order  to  benefit  from
flexibilities that are provided for in national and European law. It  is  an
absurdity that technological progress has led to a situation where,  actions
that were possible before this technology was used  –  such  as  buying  and
selling second-hand cultural goods  –  are  now  being  prohibited,  to  the
detriment of citizens.




  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


The obvious outcome would be the creation of secondary  markets  as  in  the
case of books or other physical carriers of  a  work.  This  could  lead  to
additional economic activity  without  any  real  detriment  to  the  rights
holder.

However, what needs to be taken  into  account  is  that  with  the  current
technological  developments  it  is  very  difficult  to  have  the  content
purchased resold, unless such regime overrides

(a) any contractual and licensing agreements under  which  the  content  was
made available to the user; and

(b)  any  TPM  imposed  upon  the  content  to  ensure  it  is  not  further
disseminated.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[33]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[34].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


The creation of a registration system would eliminate one to the biggest
copyright issues right now, which is that of the need for continuous
clearance of rights, a great volume of orphan works and huge costs in legal
fees and technical documentation in a fragmented and non-interoperable
fashion.


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


From the perspective of HEAL-Link it would help minimize the transaction
costs of the system

(a) by clearly marking public domain works

(b) by making it easier to find the party to negotiate with in those cases
not covered by a mandatory exception for research use, which we see as the
best way forward as outlined below in the section on Limitations and
exceptions.

(c) by allowing the evidence based design and  implementation  of  copyright
policies based on the accurate estimation  of  the  size  of  the  copyright
output of a Member State

The creation of a registration system at the EU level  would  be  beneficial
to both authors and users of works. It  would  also  be  in  line  with  the
overall objectives of EU copyright policy as  stated  in  this  consultation
document,  namely  to  ‘support  creation  and  innovation,  tap  the   full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity’.

The advantages  of  a  registration  system  have  notably  been  listed  by
WIPO[35] and go beyond facilitating licensing:
● Access to rights information: A registration system would  give  everyone
  a clear and equal access to rights information. It could also integrate a
  variety of rights information, e.g.  by  indicating  open  licensing  for
  authors that wish to distribute broadly under liberal terms.
●  Legal  certainty:  It  would  increase  the  certainty  of  who  is  the
  rightholder to a work and provide a stable catalogue  of  information  so
  that rightholders can be easily ascertained. This would help mitigate the
  problem of orphan works for future works,  as  there  will  be  a  formal
  registry of rightholders. It would also help in defining which works  are
  in the public domain and hence do not require any authorisation from  the
  rightholder. It would finally prevent unnecessary and unwanted protection
  of works of authorship,  by  notably  avoiding  that  works  are  awarded
  copyright protection even though their authors do not require  or  desire
  this protection.
● More efficient and less costly licensing:  A  registration  system  could
  provide   a   more   efficient   mechanism   for   commercial   licensing
  opportunities. Moreover, in general,  a  registration  system  will  help
  reduce the transaction costs between rightholders and potential users.

Other benefits:  If  the  registration  system  were  developed  using  open
standards and formats, it would provide a rich set of rights information  as
open data to be used in third party applications and  services.  This  could
for example enable tools that give a more accurate  overview  of  creativity
and culture in the EU.

Registration systems can lead  to  having  embedded  information  to  permit
quicker and instantaneous payment. If this is the case, this  should  in  no
case be used to restrict the freedoms of end-users.

If a registration system is created,  rightholders  should  be  required  to
register their works in order to be granted particular protections, such  as
the ability to start an enforcement action.




  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?





ΝΟ OPINION





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]




The main advantage would be the substantial reduction of  transaction  costs
and the possibility of creating multiple value added services on  the  basis
of the collected legal information.

Rules  could  be  put  in  place  whereby  certain  elements  of   copyright
protection are only available to  rightholders  who  have  registered  their
works, for example:
●  Registration  might  be  required  for  a  rightholder   to   start   an
  enforcement action (such as notice and takedown) or would be required  to
  access a particular type or  level  of  damage  awards  in  a  successful
  infringement judgment.
● Registration might  be  required  for  rightholders  to  be  eligible  to
  collect royalties through collective rights management organisations.
● Finally,  registration  could  be  made  a  prerequisite  for  prolonging
  copyright protection after an initial term  (this  would  assume  a  much
  shorter duration than the current term). For  example,  with  an  initial
  copyright  term  of  protection  of  20  years  (similar   to   patents),
  rightholders who register their  works  in  the  system  would  have  the
  ability to extend the term for works they intend  to  exploit  after  the
  first 20 years of protection.

In principle this could apply to any element of  copyright  protection  that
is not required by the Berne convention.




How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[36], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[37]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[38]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[39] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]



The European Union’s role in the adoption  of  identifiers  in  the  content
sector should be the following:
1) The EU should ensure that identifiers as well  as  rights  ownership  and
  permission databases are  based  on  open  standards,  available  to  all
  content creators and able to be read by all market participants  free  of
  charge, as well as ensuring they  are  publicly  accessible  via  machine
  readable interfaces;
2) All rights ownership and permission databases will have  to  be  provided
  as open data and through open web services
3) The EU should ensure that all identifiers as  well  as  rights  ownership
  and permission databases are interoperable  across  all  of  Europe  (and
  beyond).
4) The EU should ensure that all EU funded projects have  as  condition  the
  inclusion of rights  identifiers  to  the  produced  content  (especially
  digitization and cultural heritage, memory institutions projects).

From a methodological/procedural point of view, any system that  is  put  in
place must be developed in a true multi-stakeholder approach (e.g. not  only
by rights holders  and  intermediaries)  and  should  reflect  work  already
undertaken (for example  by  Europeana).  Rights  ownership  and  permission
databases must also include the ability  to  store  information  on  out-of-
copyright (public domain) and openly licensed works.

The scope of permission databases also needs to be carefully considered,  to
avoid rightholders  setting  unilaterally  permissions  including  for  acts
which  are  not  subject  to  copyright,  and  an  overbroad  expansion   of
identifiers for example in all types of  content,  including  user-generated
content (UGC). The latter is both unrealistic,  burdensome  considering  the
volumes of UGC generated on an hourly basis  on  the  Internet  and  creates
issues in terms of user privacy and anonymity.

The European Commission’s approach on  this  subject  has  to  be  carefully
reconsidered towards a more balanced outcome. The Commission  has  opted  to
support the vastly  and  unnecessarily  complicated  and  expensive  ‘linked
content coalition’ of  exceptionally  well-funded  organisations  to  assert
their rights on content. It seems to HEAL-Link that a much fairer,  simpler,
more  efficient  and  more  effective  approach  would  be  to  promote  the
standardised inclusion of information such as  payment  details  in  digital
content,  to  enable  commercial  users  to  easily  obtain   all   relevant
information when they need it.




Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[40]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


Overall the problems with the term of protection as it stands are as
follows:
 - it  provides  disproportional  to  the  incentives  it  aims  to  produce
   restrictions for the reuse of content which is a major drive of  economic
   activity over the Internet
 - it creates substantial competition problems
 - the long duration of the term of protection  is  disproportional  to  the
   commercial life of the works under protection
 - the amount of works benefiting from  the  long  term  of  protection  are
   disproportional to the overall amount of works that remain protected  but
   for which, gradually, information regarding their rights holders is lost.
 - it is not clear what is the moment in time where the term  of  protection
   is calculated. It depends on the type of work, the type of rights and the
   jurisdiction, creating,  thus,  unnecessary  transaction  costs  for  the
   potential licensees of the work without apparent commercial benefits.
 - it creates legal uncertainty  for  the  works  whose  authors  cannot  be
   identified  and  hence  substantially  and  unnecessarily   reduces   the
   possibility of preservation and secondary use of a work
 - it deprives Public Domain of significant works that are not  commercially
   exploited any more.

The term of copyright protection must hence be reduced to enhance access  to
knowledge and culture much more quickly. 15[41] to 25  years  seems  a  more
proportionate duration, or even 50 years, which is the  minimum  requirement
established by the Berne Convention (life of the  creator  plus  50  years).
Similar limitation of term should be processed with regard  to  neighbouring
rights and in the field of databases, where there is a  clear  risk  of  the
latter remaining indefinitely under copyright protection  if  their  creator
‘updates’ them every 20 years to start a new term.

Shortening the term of protection will decrease the  number  of  works  that
are in copyright but out of commercial exploitation  and  will  thus  reduce
the scope of the problems outlined above.

Moreover,  society  needs  not  only  shorter  copyright  term  but  also  a
mechanism enabling faster transfer to  the  public  domain  of  works  whose
right owners abandon them (as in the case of some orphan works)  or  do  not
use them commercially (out of commerce works).

At the same time, the EU should take action within WIPO in order  to  revise
the Berne standard in order to shorten it.


  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[42].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[43].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[44], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[45],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[46].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases




For an infrastructure like Heal-Link, which aims to offer all its  resources
to all of the Member States, the differences in legislation is  one  of  the
biggest hurdles to tackle.

The lack of harmonized  limitations  and  exceptions  leads  to  substantial
confusion and limited applicability of  innovative  business  models  across
the EU.

An  example  of  how  unworkable  a  non-compulsory  implementation  of  the
limitations     and     exceptions     is     can     be     found     here:
http://www.smarimccarthy.is/2011/08/copyright-combinatorics/.
“The directive outlines 21 different optional exceptions or  limitations  to
the right of reproduction of copyrighted works.  Each  country  implementing
the directive can choose to  either  include  or  leave  out  the  exception
clause. This gives us 2.097.152 different ways to implement the directive.”

For organisations, similar undertakings should be able  to  enjoy  the  same
exceptions (user rights) in all member states. This is essential  to  create
a level playing field and to ensure core single market  principles  such  as
the free movement of goods and services are preserved. It is also  important
to the competitiveness of Europe, as pointed out by EDRi in its ‘Shadow  IPR
Strategy Report’ published in May 2011:[47]
“For intellectual property rights to act as an  effective  driver  for  high
quality products and services, the legal framework must enable a maximum  of
availability of protected works, in the most coherent and predictable  legal
framework possible.
Many of the most successful recent online services are based  on  reasonable
exceptions and limitations from copyright. However, in an  environment  with
15 optional exceptions/limitations implemented  according  to  27  different
interpretations of  the  WIPO  3-step  test,  the  safest  approach  for  an
European innovator is to move to the USA, take advantage of the real  single
market there, which employs a simpler and more coherent  approach  and  come
back to the EU once the service has developed to a stage that it can  afford
the court costs and unpredictable results of European court cases.”

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


There is a need for a harmonization of exceptions at  the  doctrinal  level,
in the sense that they all become based on doctrine, with an indicative  but
mandatory rather than an exhaustive list of exceptions.

In terms of widening the existing set of  exceptions,  it  is  necessary  to
introduce text and data mining and language research exceptions

Overall,  the  harmonization  could  greatly  benefit  from  the   following
features:
 - use a general and open ended, doctrine based norms for the exceptions;
 - the exceptions are actionable positive rights;
 - exceptions should be uniformly and clearly applied to all types of works,
   rights (e.g. copyright vs.  related  rights)  and  media  (e.g.  digital/
   analogue) in which the right exists;
 - the exceptions cannot be contractually limited;
 - users are allowed to remove TPM in order to exercise their  rights  based
   on the exceptions

At least a  mandatory  EU-wide  exception  for  research  and  education  is
required to allow scientific development and progress.

As an intermediary step, the Member States should make maximum  use  of  the
current Copyright Directive exists in terms  of  implementing  the  existing
set of limitations and exceptions  creating  the  maximum  level  for  reuse
across the EU.




  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


No limitations or exceptions should be removed.

Besides, specific limitations and exceptions that are suggested bellow as  a
second best option, the following points are suggested:
 - use a general and open  ended,  doctrine  based  flexible  norm  for  the
   exceptions;
 - the exceptions are actionable positive rights;
 - users are allowed to remove TPM in order to exercise their  rights  based
   on the exceptions

A wide exception for text and data mining should be added to  the  catalogue
in order to keep  up  with  the  U.S.  competition  which  currently  allows
companies like Google to scan  and  OCR  language  materials  and  make  the
materials searchable on the internet while displaying  limited  versions  of
the content. In addition, a wide  exception  for  data  mining  would  allow
European research in artificial intelligence applications such as  the  U.S.
Watson-computer competing with and beating  humans  in  generating  Jeopardy
questions while using internet content.

A special exception for text and data mining (TDM) should be introduced:  It
should be clarified that TDM does not fall under  copyright  provisions.  On
top of this, a specific exception allowing the copying of  content  for  the
purpose of text and data mining is necessary. It should also  be  explicitly
stated in the law that technical protection measures  (TPMs)  and  contracts
should not override such an exception, nor  any  other  exception.  Finally,
such an  exception  should  not  distinguish  between  commercial  and  non-
commercial purposes  as,  for  research  institutions,  this  would  prevent
knowledge transfer and such a differentiation would not  be  in  the  public
interest.  The exception should not preclude the reuse of data and text  for
research purposes.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


The U.S. system with fair use has proven to  produce  a  better  environment
for education,  research  and  conducting  business.  Failure  to  implement
either open ended, doctrine based flexible norm for the  exceptions  in  the
fashion of fair use or at least an  exception  for  research  and  education
will continue to hamper European R&D. The best approach would be to  combine
a strong education/research exception (including text and data mining)  with
a flexible fair use exception. From an economic perspective, the current  EU
copyright regime puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage with the rest  of
the world, as knowledge intensive economies such as  the  US,  South  Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore benefit from ‘Fair  Use’  exceptions.  In  the  US  for
example, the added value of the Fair Use-related industry was  estimated  at
16% of the GDP in 2007.[48]

Note that the US legal system recognizes that flexibility is needed to  give
access to copyrighted materials which essentially  does  not  prejudice  the
original commercial interests of the right holders.

As pointed out by Professors Hugenholtz  and  Senftleben,  such  a  flexible
approach is not only necessary but is also  in  line  with  the  origins  of
copyright in the EU:[49]
“There appear to be good reasons and ample opportunity  to  (re)introduce  a
measure of flexibility in the national  copyright  systems  of  Europe.  The
need for having more openness in copyright law  is  almost  self-evident  in
this ‘information society’ of highly dynamic  and  unpredictable  change.  A
historic perspective also suggests that, due to a variety of  circumstances,
copyright law, particularly in the civil law jurisdictions  of  Europe,  has
lost much of its flexibility in the course of the  past  century.  In  other
words, making copyright law in author’s rights regimes more  flexible  would
not go against  the  grain  of  legal  tradition.  (…)  We  would  therefore
recommend to introduce a  measure  of  flexibility  alongside  the  existing
structure of well-defined limitations and exceptions, and thus  combine  the
advantages of legal security and technological neutrality.”

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


As indicated  above  in  Questions  22-24,  we  are  in  great  need  for  a
doctrinal, open-ended and harmonized rather exhaustive list based  approach.


The  greatest  drawback  of  such  an  approach  is  a  period  of  relative
uncertainty in the early stages  of  its  application,  until  the  ECJ  and
Member States courts provide decisions  specifying  the  boundaries  of  the
doctrine. However, such issues of legal uncertainty  are  not  greater  than
the current level of uncertainty, particularly with regards  to  the  cross-
border use of material.

In addition, they are outweighted by the benefits of the doctrinal and open-
ended approach. Such benefits include:
 - technology and medium neutral approach
 - future proof approach that ensures longevity of the legislative reform
 - predictability is to increase as the right stemming from  the  exceptions
   matures, as the US case indicates
 - positive effect for innovation and reuse of material.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to




Academic Consortia  such  as  HEAL-Link  suffer  from  the  differences  and
inconsistencies in the implementation of the Copyright Directive  exceptions
from Member State to Member State.

The lack of harmonized limitations and exceptions has led to the paradox  of
the Member States having  little  or  no  room  for  updating  or  expanding
existing exceptions while leaving  them  great  space  for  variations  that
increase transaction costs.[50]



  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

[Open question]

Generally speaking, we suggest introducing two rules:
- there should be compensation only in the cases where there is evidence  of
 specific harm to authors that cannot be compensated in any other fashion.
- there  should  be  no  compensation  for  non-commercial  educational  and
 research use when it is produces a common good, e.g. in the form of public
 knowledge.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[51] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[52].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[53].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.


A number of issues have to  be  raised  with  regards  to  the  preservation
exception:
 - it should be applied across the EU to all types  of  material  (not  just
   books), refer to all types of rights (not just copyright), all  types  of
   formats (not just printed books but digital content and online  works  as
   well) and all  types  of  memory  and  research  institutions  (not  just
   libraries  but   also   archives,   museums   and   research   performing
   organisations).
 - the exception should be harmonized across the European Union
 - it should override all licensing and contractual agreements and Technical
   Protection Measures
 - it should allow the  research  use  of  the  digitized  for  preservation
   material in the absence of the original or the format shifting
 - use of the digitized material for preservation should also be allowed for
   educational and research purposes and text or data mining as well as  all
   forms of LT processing for research purposes



29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

A solution could have the following elements:
 - There should be a specific exception that allows libraries  and  archives
   to offer full access  to  their  digital  material  for  educational  and
   research   infrastructures,   Educational   and    Research    Performing
   Organisations for research as well as for Text and Data Mining purposes;
 - explicitly broadening the existing exception in Article  5(2)(c)  of  the
   InfoSoc Directive, so that it allows institutions to  make  reproductions
   of all works in their collection as long as these are  not  intended  for
   direct commercial advantage.[54]
 - Harmonise the adoption of the exception across the EU
 - Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to  enforce
   exceptions and limitations  and  to  ensure  legitimate  utilisations  of
   protected works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.
 - with regards to subscribed online materials, libraries should be  granted
   a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right  to  archive  one  complete
   copy of  the  subscribed  online  materials,  and  to  use  the  archived
   materials  in  the  event  that  access  on  the  original  platform   is
   discontinued or suspended. An exception should ensure, at the request  of
   the  library,  the  availability   of   back-up   files   for   long-term
   preservation, regardless of the format of publication.
 - The National library or other national infrastructure of the  country  of
   utilisation (i.e.  the  country  of  the  purchasing  library)  could  be
   responsible for local hosting for preservation purpose, as  well  as  for
   permanent access and use of the licensed materials  by  authorised  users
   after the termination of a license contract.


  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

 - There should be a specific exception that allows libraries  and  archives
   to offer full access  to  their  digital  material  for  educational  and
   research infrastructures, for Machine Translation and data/  text  mining
   purposes.
 - Expand the art. 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive, so that it includes all
   types of memory and research institutions and allows reproduction as part
   of a digitization effort as well  as  reproduction  for  format  shifting
   purposes.
 - Memory institutions  should  be  granted  a  nonexclusive,  royalty-free,
   perpetual right to archive one complete copy  of  the  subscribed  online
   materials, and to use the archived materials in the event that access  on
   the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An  exception  should
   ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up  files
   for long-term preservation, regardless of the format of publication.

  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]


Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

There is a number of issues regarding negotiations with  rights  holders  as
an institutional user or a network of institutions:
 - the rights holders do not have all rights necessary for the completion of
   the transaction or do have not a clear understanding of the rights status
   of their works
 - problems with the packaging of rights, particularly when operating  as  a
   consortium (e.g. licensing of a package of  rights  instead  of  targeted
   works). Also there are bundling problems, when  rightsholders  force  the
   institution or consortium of institutions to buy  a  bundle  of  licences
   rather specific titles they want (particularly with journals)
 - open access embargo periods can be bigger than the desired one
 - annual re-negotiation of fees for journals by  players  with  significant
   market power
 - limitations in the access of back issues of journals
 - limitations in the possibility of text and data-mining of the  electronic
   journals
 - contractual terms limiting the scope of  exceptions,  with  cross  border
   application but not clear  applicability  (e.g.  in  jurisdictions  where
   exceptions cannot be overridden by contractual provisions)
 - limitations in cross-border access of journals
 - limitations with regards to the platforms from which the content will  be
   accessed
 - limitations in preservation copies
 - limitations in digitization of physical journals
 - limitations in inter-library loans
 - limitations in the re-use of the material as  part  of  Open  Educational
   Resources or Open Courseware
 - limitations in the access and reuse of bibliographic  metadata  or  their
   integration into digital library systems
 -  limitations  in  archived  content  or  the  content  itself  after  the
   termination of the licence agreement


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]


 - Adopt all the exceptions suggested above
 - Introduce specific and mandatory exceptions ensuring that anyone can make
   their collections available on-line via electronic networks, such as  the
   Internet, for scientific and educational purposes without restriction  to
   on-site terminals.



  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

 - Broaden the existing exception of Art. 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc Directive
 - The scope of the exception should expand to cover all non-commercial uses

  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

There is considerable uncertainty about the status  of  e-lending  under  EU
law. The Directive on rental  and  lending  rights  (2006/115/EC)  does  not
explicitly exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its scope  and
some libraries argue that based on  the  current  acquis  and  the  UsedSoft
decision by the CJEU (Case C-128/11) they should be allowed  to  provide  e-
books in libraries for download.  In  the  Netherlands  the  Association  of
Public Libraries (Vereniging van  Openbare  Bibliotheken)  has  brought  the
matter before the courts. They started a test case  against  the  collective
management organisation in charge of the lending  right  arguing  that  they
should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download.

The most common problems include:
 - uncertainty with regards to the legal status of e-books and the
   exhaustion of the right
 - denial of publishers to sell e-books to libraries
 - removal of e-content without prior notifications
 - complex and multiple licensing schemes
 - lack of openness of the books for use for research or text mining
   purposes

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

 • Unambiguously and clearly include the right to e-lending to the EU acquis
 • Have e-lending covered by a uniformly implemented across  the  EU  member
   states exception
 • Adopt the EBLIDA ‘key principles on the acquisition of and access  to  e-
   books by libraries’[55]:
 • All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be available to
   libraries for acquisition and access;
 • All e-book titles should  be  available  to  libraries  at  the  time  of
   publication;
 • Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats;
 • Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or  licensed  e-
   books for a limited period of time to a user;
 • It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously; and,
 • Registered users should be able to  download  an  e-book  either  in  the
   library or by way of remote access via authentication systems.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

The differences between the two types of collections are  enormous  both  in
terms of physical and economic behaviour of the collection.

In terms of Language Processing, it is crucial that we  move  to  a  digital
collection which makes text and data mining, machine  learning  and  machine
translation possible, whereas the analogue collection makes  all  such  uses
extremely expensive or impossible.

With regards to the  above  the  ‘Study  on  the  application  of  Directive
2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society’  that
was commissioned by  the  European  Commission  and  published  in  December
2013[56] contains an interesting observation. At  the  end  of  the  section
discussing  inter  alia  the   exception   benefitting   cultural   heritage
institutions, the authors observe that:[57]
“The  large-scale  digitization  projects  ultimately  aim  at  the   making
available of the collection, (...) the making available for consultation  is
increasingly requested to apply at distance and online; and the  lending  is
shifting to cover the online transmission of digital items.  The  exception-
by-exception reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc  Directive,  might
not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to look  at  different  uses  that
some categories of users (libraries or  educational  institutions)  or  some
objectives  (access  to  culture  and  knowledge  or  education)  would   be
privileged to undertake under a limitation of copyright. (...) the space  of
non-infringing uses could be defined by their  objective  and  some  general
conditions, including a more open requirement that the use does  not  exceed
what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this  study
has not made. It could make our  system  of  exceptions  more  fit  for  its
purpose and understandable for users and  copyright  owners  alike.  If  the
requirements for each exception are adequate and legitimate,  it  would  not
sacrifice the high level of protection of copyright and related rights  that
the EU law has adopted.”

From the perspective of cultural  heritage  institutions  such  an  approach
would have many benefits. It would create room for rethinking Europe's  rich
tradition of providing  access  to  knowledge  and  culture  through  public
institutions and it would enable our  institutions  to  fully  leverage  the
possibilities offered by digitisation and near universal connectivity.

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

[Open question]

For simple consultation or public lending,  there  is  no  real  difference,
whereas for all language processing activities, there is a  vast  difference
between the two indicated in the previous answers.

Additionally,  public  lending  for  both  print  and  e-books   should   be
remuneration-free for educational and research uses (as those  performed  in
libraries of educational and research institutions) in the framework of  the
advancement of education and research.


Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[58].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[59].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


Both the Orphan Works Directive and the 2011 MoU on out  of  commerce  works
are  insufficient  to  address  the  copyright  issues  arising  from   mass
digitisation projects. In addition, the extremely slow  uptake  of  the  MoU
(according to the 2013 ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC  on
copyright and related rights  in  the  information  society’  there  is  one
single project that is ‘inspired’ by the MoU)[60] clearly  illustrates  that
the MoU is not a suitable mechanism for  enabling  mass  digitisation  on  a
large scale.

However, it could be extended to also include the members of HEAL-Link.




  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain


The following suggestions are made:
 - The solution referred to in the answer  to  questions  40  and  34  above
   namely extending the scope of the  exception  in  Article  5(3)n  of  the
   InfoSoc Directive, should cover all types  of  works  and  other  subject
   matters that are held by these institutions.
 - EU-wide access to broadcasters’ archives would  give  a  major  boost  to
   contemporary language research in a multi-lingual Europe  while  language
   is primarily spoken and only secondarily written. Currently  research  on
   language and our cultural  heritage  can  only  be  freely  conducted  on
   written material from the 19th century or earlier.


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[61]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

While the exception regarding illustration for teaching is broadly  drafted,
there is very narrow implementation  amongst  Member  States.  This  is  yet
another case  of  poor  implementation  of  the  copyright  Directive  in  a
meaningful way for the application of the exceptions and  of  the  need  for
harmonisation of the system of limitations  and  exceptions  with  mandatory
exceptions and an open ended doctrine based system.

  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Make a broad educational exception mandatory across all Member States.

  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]

Various mechanisms  exists  and  have  been  listed  both  in  the  European
Commission ‘Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy’[62]  and  the
recently published ‘Study on the  application  of  Directive  2001/29/EC  on
copyright and related rights in the information society’.[63]

These  mechanisms  mainly  involve   extensive   collective   licensing   or
agreements with publishers at national level. For example,  universities  in
Spain pay to collecting societies a flat fee of 5 euro per student to  allow
reproduction and online uses of works for teaching purposes.

These  mechanisms   often   create   legal   uncertainty   for   educational
institutions, since there is a risk that no agreement or  a  restricted  one
will be reached (e.g. in Denmark no agreement has been  reached  on  digital
copying  between   the   collective   rights   societies   and   educational
institutions, apart from one with  teacher  training  colleges).  They  also
enhance  the  inconsistency  of  use  of  works  across  Member  States  for
educational purposes.

Heal-Link therefore considers that these mechanisms  are  counter-productive
and  lead  to  inefficient  results,  as  on  the   one   hand   educational
institutions sometimes end up seeking licenses for uses that do not  require
to be licensed,  and  on  the  other  hand,  certain  rightholders  prohibit
certain permitted uses by employing technical protection measures (TPMs)  or
imposing restrictive contractual clauses


  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]

The legislative solution should have the following features:
 - EU wide mandatory application
 - The works should be  made  available  on-line  for  educational  purposes
   without restriction to on-site terminals, both in original form, as  well
   as in the form of an adaptation or  compilation,  both  in  analogue  and
   digital form.
 - All types of works should be covered
 - The focus should be the educational and research use and not the type  of
   the institution
 - The best solution is a no licence / no compensation  model.  Second  best
   option is to provide compensation  if  the  use  is  detrimental  to  the
   interests of the rightsholder

  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]


Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[64]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


There is a number of issues related to the research exceptions:
 - different implementation of the research exception  in  different  member
   states resulting in uncertainty as  to  the  applicable  rules  regarding
   content reuse
 - problems with private international law interpretation of the  exceptions
   in the case of cross-border transfer of data
 - licences applied in some content in certain  jurisdictions  override  the
   research exception
 - TPM stop research use even when the research exceptions allows it
 - Text and data mining  are  prohibited  under  most  licensing  agreements
   rendering the research exception irrelevant



  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

(a) Legislative solution:
- introduce a mandatory and with clear scope research  exception  (including
 data and text mining) that  is  neutral  with  regard  to  technology  and
 geography.
- do  not  allow  contractual  and  technical  agreements  to  override  the
research exception
- there should not be any differentiation regarding subject matter, type  of
 user or type of rights
-  the  legislative  approach  outlined  above   has   been   proposed   and
 substantiated by the  Max  Planck  Institute  for  Intellectual  Property,
 Competition and Tax Law in its response to the ‘Green Paper  Copyright  in
 the Knowledge Economy’ consultations in 2008[65] and further  defined  and
 supported by Reichman and Okediji.[66]

(b) Voluntary/ self-regulation or reflexive self-regulation approach:
- this is an approach that could be  implemented  as  a  result  of  funding
 agreements or national research/ academia laws  or  a  part  of  Codes  of
 Conduct and model policies or as the result  of  self  regulation  in  the
 threat of legislative action if it is not properly implemented.
- research results and primary data that have been  publicly  funded  should
 be  released  under   licences   complying   with   the   Open   Knowledge
 Definition.[67]
- The Commission should further promote and encourage  open  access  models,
 notably in its Horizon 2020 research framework  and  the  Creative  Europe
 programmes.
- Special funding should be given for the Open Data and Public  Domain  days
 by the national Copyright Offices, similar to the celebrations of the  IPR
 day.

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]


 - Some of the Member States already offer wide technology neutral  research
   exceptions (e.g. Estonia). However, in most of  the  Member  States,  the
   exceptions are more limited in substance and geographical  scope  and  do
   not really  offer  much  help.  In  addition,  as  mentioned  above,  the
   inconsistency in the approach  between  different  jurisdictions  renders
   such mechanisms ineffective.
 - Some member states have model open access policies both at  the  national
   and institutional level. While these  mechanisms  are  overall  extremely
   useful  when  adopted,  when  there  is  no  political  will  for   their
   implementation or the institutional capacity is not such that there is an
   understanding of the value of implementing them, there is great risk that
   they remain unused. In addition, it could  be  that  they  are  not  used
   across the board and as a result lead to a fragmentation of the  research
   material, that there is no legal documentation as to  the  kind  of  open
   access that is provided (documentation of the relevant licence)  or  that
   there is no understanding among the staff as to which licence is the best
   to be used. Finally, it is often the case that  there  are  long  embargo
   periods or that the content while open  access,  it  lack  the  technical
   infrastructure and the legal documentation so that it may be  freely  re-
   used (including text and data mining).
 - Some Member States have excluded libraries in  educational  and  research
   institutions from remuneration for lending their materials  to  teachers,
   students and researchers.  This measure consists a fundamental  step  for
   the advancement of education and research.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[68]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [69].

The Marrakesh Treaty[70] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

At  present,  persons  with  disabilities  –  in  particular  the   visually
impaired, deaf , dyslexic and other print disabled persons – in the  EU  and
globally, only have access to a very small fraction of the reading  material
published each year.

This situation is especially  limited  with  regards  to  the  cross  border
shipment or exchange of accessible formats  for  persons  with  disabilities
given that Member States and International law up until now does  not  allow
the legal cross border exchange of reading content  among  institutions  and
organisations that serve the cultural and academic  needs  of  persons  with
disabilities.

The ratification and effective implementation  by  the  EU  and  its  Member
States of the World  Intellectual  Property  Organisation  (WIPO)  Marrakech
Treaty[71] could  overcome  much  of  this  problem  for  visually  impaired
persons, but these exceptions and limitations to copyright  should  also  be
extended to person with other disabilities.

In addition, in  many  jurisdictions  the  legislative  initiatives  require
regulatory measures (e.g. ministerial decrees) that come  after  an  unequal
bargaining with the collecting societies and the publishers. The  result  is
lengthy –and, hence, expensive- negotiations  that  the  representatives  of
the disabilities groups are not always able to follow and sustain.

The distribution, copying and communication of works  published  in  special
formats across  borders  are  not  included  in  EU  legislation.  Copyright
exceptions are applied on a Member State  level  and  do  not  permit  cross
border shipments of protected works.




  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]

Two measures are suggested:
- The WIPO Marrakech Treaty[72] by the EU and its Member  States  is  needed
 to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities.
- A broader interpretation of EU exceptions applied  to  other  disabilities
 should also be included in EU and national legislations.



  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]


There are no mechanisms and hence there is market failure.


Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[73] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[74].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


A very significant part of modern language research relies on text and  data
mining. The current EU-standard for what is  allowed  is  very  unclear  and
permission to engage in more extensive research projects  on  existing  data
collections is often denied by the legal departments without first  clearing
the rights with the right holders. This often turns out to be  prohibitively
expensive. Compared with the U.S., where the fair use exception offers  more
flexibility for researchers to engage in  text  and  data  mining,  European
institutions are thus at a very big disadvantage.

More specifically:
 - there is a lack of clarity as to the material which is in  copyright  and
   in the public domain in different jurisdiction
 - there is an absence (in most Member  States)  of  an  explicit  exception
   regarding text and data mining and web crawling and  as  a  result  great
   uncertainty as to what is allowed and what not
 - the way in  which  the  Public  Sector  Information  (PSI)  Directive  is
   implemented varies among Member States and as a result it is  not  clear:
   (a) whether there is PSI that does not constitute copyrighted material at
   all (b) which PSI falls under the limitations and  exceptions  of  Member
   States’ copyright laws and under which conditions and (c)  which  PSI  is
   copyrighted but is available for re-use. In that case, the implementation
   of the PSI Directive 2013 is to be seen whether it will lead to  openness
   by default, and under which licence,  for  PSI  that  now  also  includes
   content from Museums, Libraries and Archives
 - the lack of licensing information combined with a  clear  exceptions  and
   limitations regime makes most text and data mining activities  marginally
   legal
 - the enforcement of TPMs makes text and data mining impossible
 - it is unclear how much of data mining falls under the research exception.
   Even when it does, this is not necessarily true for all mined content.
 - In the case of web-crawling complex questions of jurisdiction emerge that
   are very costly to resolve.

  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

The following suggestions are made:
 - text and data mining should be approached as activities that do not  fall
   within the scope of copyright regulation,  insofar as it merely  extracts
   new information or  data  from  existing  materials  and  consists  of  a
   transformative use that does not take away value  from  the  original  or
   acts as a substitute.
 - Researchers must be able to share the results of text and data mining, as
   long as these results are not substitutable for  the  original  copyright
   work - irrespective of copyright law, database law or  contractual  terms
   to the contrary.
 - Text and data mining should be allowed either in  the  form  of  an  open
   ended, doctrinal fair-use style exception or as a concrete exception.
 - There should  not  be  a  differentiation  between  commercial  and  non-
   commercial text mining since such an approach would severely restrict the
   applicability of LR/LT research, particularly  with  regards  to  Machine
   Translation applications
 - The exception should be uniformly  implemented,  be  obligatory  and  not
   susceptible to contractual or technical restrictions.


  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

 - Use of a fair use-type doctrine
 - Alternatively introduce an exceptions with the features presented in  the
   answer of question 54.


  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]
No solution other than licensing is possible.

 • First, the negotiation of licences is resource intensive and un-scalable,
   and the starting point is often one of lack  of  balance  of  negotiating
   powers.
 • Secondly, licences do not address the current ambiguity around the mining
   of the open Web.; and,
 • Thirdly, licensing text and data mining  (TDM)  is  unjustifiable  as  no
   licence should be required to mine.
 • Finally, the transaction costs of licence identification and  negotiation
   are higher than the cost of the licence itself.

  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]




 - Member State implementations of the Data  protection  Directive  and  its
   research exceptions. The  differentiation  between  commercial  and  non-
   commercial research may cause unnecessary restrictions to the  conducting
   and exploitation of research
 - There is need for a harmonised and law based rather  than  licence  based
   implementation of the  “open  by  default”  options  that  the  PSI  2013
   Directive provides
 - There is lack of information regarding licensing of text in cases of text
   and data mining.


User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[75]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[76].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


Current EU laws make it virtually impossible to share  remixes  and  mashups
of pre-existing works online, even in non-commercial contexts and when  only
very minor parts of works are re-used.[77]
There are several reasons for this:
 • Use of minor parts: often the use of pre-existing works implies  the  re-
   combination of many but only very minor parts of these  works  (e.g.  few
   seconds of an hour-long movie in a video mashup), which makes efforts for
   clearing the respective rights disproportionate.
 • Recombination of different types of works: Not only are  the  parts  used
   often very minor, but often remix videos are combined with short  samples
   of musical works, which further complicates rights clearing.
 • Use in non-commercial contexts: many cases of  the  use  of  pre-existing
   works happen in  non-commercial  contexts  (e.g.  smartphone-videos  with
   copyrighted music).

A practical illustration of these problems can be found in  Germany,  during
the last election campaigns in 2013. Several mashup and  remix  videos  were
disseminated, made of short parts of pre-existing works. Even  though  these
videos were released by major  parties  (SPD,  FDP)  and  trade  unions  (IG
Metall), none of these actors were  able  to  clear  the  rights  for  these
videos.

While this is a  major  obstacle  for  freedom  of  creative  expression  in
general, it is particularly problematic that  Europeans  have  substantially
fewer rights than, for instance, US citizens, which in many cases can  refer
to the Fair Use clause in US copyright law.




  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?

      works)?

  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]





  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?


Two main legislative changes are necessary:
1) More flexibility: A more  flexible  approach  is  needed,  combining  the
  current system of a list of exceptions (but made  mandatory  for  all  EU
  countries and specified as not exhaustive), but stating specifically that
  these cases must be interpreted as applying to ‘similar uses’ and  add  a
  more general open norm based on  ‘fair  use’  or  general  principles  of
  fairness. The German ‘bagatelle clause’  can  also  be  considered  as  a
  possible starting point for such an open norm  that  would  render  legal
  many everyday online activities that currently  infringe  copyright  even
  though they cause no harm to the rightholders.
2) Introduction of a remix  exception:  In  addition  to  more  flexibility,
  there should be an explicit remix exception  to  the  InfoSoc  Directive.
  This remix exception  would  permit  creative  re-combinations  based  on
  existing works. Such an approach was taken with success in Canada,  under
  Article 29.21 of the UGC Canada Copyright Act.[78]

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]



 III. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[79]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[80][81].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[82]  in
      the digital environment?




€ NO OPINION


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[83]




€ NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[84]




€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[85].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?




€ NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]


  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]


  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]


  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[86] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[87]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

 - Authors and performers should have the ability to regain control of works
   that they have assigned to third parties if those third  parties  do  not
   actively exploit their works (anymore). Such a non-usus  clause  can  for
   example be found in the changes  to  the  Dutch  copyright  act  that  is
   currently being reviewed by the Dutch parliament.
 -  Authors  of  scientific  articles  and  other  short  works   (such   as
   contributions to proceeding of academic proceedings should have the (time
   delayed) right to publish such works in an open access  publication  that
   cannot be waived or transferred to another party  such  as  a  scientific
   publisher. Such clauses aimed  at  ensuring  public  access  to  publicly
   funded academic research can be found in the German copyright law and  in
   the proposed revisions to the Dutch copyright act.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

YES


Given that  the  European  Union  is  currently  promoting  open  access  to
publicly funded research (including both the  actual  publications  and  the
research data) as part of the Horizon2020 program  it  seems  reasonable  to
create the legal conditions that ensure that authors of academic  works  can
fulfil  their  open  access  obligations  even  when  they  also  work  with
scientific publishers. In addition and in line with our previous answers  we
believe that any other measure  to  improve  the  standing  of  authors  and
performers  vis-à-vis  publishers  and  other  distributors  can   best   be
strengthened at the EU level.

  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

There  is  a  need  to  undertake  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  economics
underlying the creation and dissemination of culture, since currently it  is
often wrongly assumed that every use of work should be remunerated in  order
to satisfy creators’ interests.

There exists evidence that these interests  are  not  harmed,  or  that  the
public interest benefits, in cases where some uses are not remunerated,  and
this evidence should be systematically  gathered  and  analysed  before  any
legislative action is undertaken to further empower copyright monopolies.


   V. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[88] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[89].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available  in
case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to  strengthen
respect for copyright when the infringed content is used  for  a  commercial
purpose[90]. One  means  to  do  this  could  be  to  clarify  the  role  of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[91]. At the same time,  there  could
be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and  data
protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ NO – Please explain




 - Copyright use for the purpose of education  and  non-commercial  research
   should be permitted under a mandatory research  and  education  exception
   and not be subject to law enforcement. This would allow  law  enforcement
   resources to be used more efficiently.
 - The most effective way to improve ‘respect for rights’ would be  to  take
   user concerns seriously  when  addressing  the  other  issues  identified
   throughout our answers to the entire consultation.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]



Intermediaries should remain non-liable for copyright  violations,  as  this
is likely to  lead  to  privatisation  of  enforcement  with  many  negative
externalities and increased cost of the  service  providers  which  will  be
eventually transferred to the end-user.


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

NO


The current system does not manage to achieve a  balanced  approach  between
current and future creators or user-creators since:
- it insists viewing the users as end-users rather than  as  users-creators,
 whereas the technology has rendered almost all uses of content to forms of
 re-use
- there is no positive right to fair use
- there is an imbalance both in terms of knowledge and resources  and  hence
 an imbalanced negotiation process in most licensing use cases.


  VI. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

No OPINION




Heal-Link considers harmonization as important for  the  EU  single  market,
the  Commission  has  given  insufficient  information  as  to  what  it  is
suggesting under the  heading  ‘single  EU  Copyright  Title’  to  allow  an
informed answer to be given to this question.

  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

Harmonisation should be dealt with in the near future.  There  is  too  much
legal uncertainty and the adaptation to the  digital  era  needs  to  happen
now! The more the EU waits the less attractive the European market  is,  the
less innovation can be developed and the less EU  citizens  have  access  to
the same content and services.

While looking at reviewing the current  EU  laws,  EU  countries  should  be
encouraged to promote more flexibility and a user-friendly approach  to  how
they implement their copyright laws.

Interim solutions such  as  clarifying  the  current  InfoSoc  Directive  to
ensure it is adapted in the broadest and  most  flexible  manner  by  Member
States is an immediate action  point  that  the  European  Commission  could
already undertake in the documents it plans to release before  summer  2014.
Interpretative guidelines could also allow to create more clarity at  an  EU
level.

Moreover, the adoption of such a single Title should  not  result  into  the
adoption of a set  of  rules  representing  the  lowest  common  denominator
between all Member States.
.

 VII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

Overall HEAL-Link proposes to take a clear and unambiguous position  towards
the introduction of positive user rights
(a) at a global level, i.e. through WIPO,
(b) at a regional level, i.e. through and EU Directive and
(c) at a national level by supporting positive user rights  policies,  where
   these exist (e.g. Public Sector Information rights).

Using open or extended collective licences has been a key element of a  more
balanced copyright policy for the past ten years. However, it is  high  time
to  move  forward  seeking  change  at  the  legislative  rather  than   the
contractual level. Open licensing has been tremendously successful in  terms
of making the business case  for  open  data  and  content,  but  much  less
successful in terms of reducing clearance costs and uncertainty inherent  in
a  copyright  system  that  requires  no  formalities  or  registration  for
protection and that still relies in the EU context on an  exclusive  set  of
limitations and exceptions rather than a fair use doctrine.

What  ten  years  of  experience  with  open  content  licences  has   amply
demonstrated is that users are no more passive  recipients  of  content  but
rather active creators, especially in the  context  of  language  resources,
and, hence, they  require  positive  rights  rather  than  mere  exceptions,
particularly when such exceptions are list- and not doctrine- based.

The re-use of LRs is  not  something  that  may  be  easily  solved  through
licensing, since it poses an excessive clearance  and  licence  choice  cost
upon the Language Technologies providers, it does not solve the  problem  of
orphan works and does  not  take  into  consideration  the  issue  of  works
belonging to rights-holder other than the LR providers.

Hence, the overall direction  needs  to  shift  and  have  three  successive
goals:
(a) the overarching goal  should  be  the  establishment  of  positive  user
rights
(b) if this is not possible, the aim should be the transition to a fair  use
doctrine in the EU
(c) if this is not immediately achievable,  extensive  collective  licensing
   and linking of funding with open licensing should be sought

While licensing remains an option, it is  the  very  last  option  HEAL-Link
should  consider.  It  currently  serves  Member   States   with   developed
documentation of their works and a positive  IPR  trading  balance,  but  is
highly unlikely to offer any substantial  benefits  to  Member  States  with
nascent information society services and negative IPR trade balances.

instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

.
[59] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.
