     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

Following the adoption of the directive on collective management, the only rational
solution would be to wait for the transposition of the directive, in particular for the
expiry of the deadline provided for in Article 30, and the application of Article 33.
Before the thorough examination of the effect of the measures provided for in the said
rules, it would be premature to introduce further measures in the field of copyright.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES
Substantive law, the conflict of laws and jurisdiction should be kept as different issues -
the substantive law is clear. From the aspect of the authors’ right, a special type of
communication to the public right as well as a right of reproduction (if there is a
reproduction element) is needed. As far as the holders of the related rights are
concerned, their making available right is required.
As far as the applicable law is concerned, the key issue is where the exploitation (use in
terms of copyright) takes place. The answer is again given in the territories of the
Member States where either communication to the public and/or reproduction take
place. From this starting point, Rome I or Rome II Regulations shall be applied
depending on the lawful or unlicensed type of use. The jurisdiction problem is tackled
by the EU Court practice. Both the Falco as well as the Pinkney judgements are clear.
The country of origin principle would lead to licensing forum shopping, therefore it may
not be applied in relation to the making available right, let alone to the problem of
enforcement that is bound to the country where the actual use in terms of copyright
takes place. Such a solution would be– with high probability – in conflict with the
international commitments and their accepted interpretation of the EU as well.
The target country approach of the CJEU can be used to solve jurisdiction issues of
consumer protection where the purpose is to ensure the right of access to remedies of
consumers. The application of this approach to copyright issues (scope of license,
enforcement of copyright) may lead to uncertainties in cases where the target countries
cannot be defined unambiguously. If the use of works /other protected subject-matter
may take place in countries other than the targeted ones the target country approach is
useless. In some cases, the examination of the intention of the commercial user may help
to a certain extent, but the possibility of the actual access to the works/protected subject-
matters may not be set aside.
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                             11

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO
The existence of the reproduction right and that of the making available (a special
subtype of communication to the public) is not a novelty. Commercial users are used to
obtaining more licenses. All broadcasting licenses include the two licenses granted with
regards to the two modes of use. The same applies to online uses. Since Hungary follows
the continental traditions, the two rights are exercised by the same CMO in the field of
authors’ musical rights. There is however a consequence of the Commission’s soft law
legislation (the Online Recommendation), namely that the major publishers withdrew
the representation of the mechanical reproduction rights from the musical CMO-s. Here
the fulfilment of the objective of the re-aggregation of the repertoires of the collective
management directive has to be observed and evaluated before jumping to unfounded
conclusions. It is moreover to be noted that the fact that more rightholders are involved
in the musical online licensing (authors and music publishers – the re-aggregation is to
be evaluated + performing artists + sound recording producers – here the assignment of
performing artists’ making available right is the issue) is a hard fact that cannot be

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

changed or touched upon by legislation. Economic rights cannot be “taken away” or
regrouped. A possible legislation on statutory one stop shops in the online field may
violate the international commitments. However, the voluntary one stop shops might
mitigate the eventual problem of obtaining more licenses. Anyway, audiovisual and fine
arts’ rights are in one hand.
In addition, the type of the online service is also an important fact. It can be disputed
and depends on the technology used whether the provider of a pure streaming service
needs a mechanical reproduction license or not. A differentiated approach is therefore
needed.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
The pending decisions of the ECJ should be waited on before jumping to any legislation.
There are controversial scholarly opinions on the legal nature of linking. It may not be
defined that per definitionem all types of linking to foreign content (deep, surface,
embedded, framing, indexing) constitute communication to the public, no matter
whether the link leads to a content that is made lawfully or unlawfully available. At the
same time, the type of linking may play a role in the evaluation of the behaviour. A
thorough analysis of the hyperlink as a technological notion is necessary. Depending on
the result of the analysis, the introduction of a possible well defined free use of the
traditional forms of links to a protected content may be considered.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              14
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The introduction of the exhaustion of online rights would lead to the collapse of the
existing lawful services. In addition, it would go against the rules and preambles laid
down in the Infosoc Directive as well as the practice of the ECJ (Laserdisken) on the
limitation of the exhaustion to tangible property. The “resale” always constitutes a new
copy, a new reproduction, even if the deletion of the first “sold” copy can be monitored,
which is very doubtful.
The UsedSoft judgement is not a way to follow. It is based on the lex specialis of the
Software Directive.
In addition it includes
- a serious gapon the possibility to track the deletion of the first copy,
- a serious legal dogmatic mistake of mixing up licensing with sale, and thereby urging
the software producers not to grant licenses in the future for the entire term of
protection and to choose other (cloud based) business models.
The rightholders would not have a fair share from the incomes generated by the new
market to be opened by the possible introduction of a digital exhaustion and this model
would undermine the paradigm of copyright, meaning the incentive function. If the
price of the “first sale” should be based on the calculation of all further possible online
uses, it would lead to a radical increase of prices.
The introduction of the digital exhaustion would corrupt the enforcement. It would be
impossible to track whether the source of the “resold” copy was a lawful one or not.

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             15

-
17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
-


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
Voluntary registration systems exist in various Member States, also in Hungary. The
only function of such systems -due to the prohibition of formalities under the Berne
Convention - is that the substantiation of an infringement claim may be corroborated by
the registration that may not constitute either protection nor authorship, let alone the
certification of title chain.
As a result there are no reasonable incentive to set up a European registration system.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.



31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The role of the EU in this field may not exceed the support of the private initiatives by
soft law. The objectives to be supported are the elaboration and distribution of industry
standards. Grants may also contribute to the adoption of identifiers.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X YES – Please explain
The term of protection is part of the copyright paradigm (the incentive to create). This
incentive may not be understood as an individual incentive for the creator only but
rather as a general incentive for the community of creators. Therefore, the term of
protection, as it has been increased lately by the amendment of the term of the
protection directive, expresses that the creators of widely and long used works will
receive their reward. If a work does not “live” as long as the term of protection, the term
of protection does not play any role. In cases where works are so highly appreciated that
they are used even decades after the death of the original author, the protection is well
justified.
The economic weight of the copyright based industries also support the keeping of the
term of protection as it is.
What would happen to the value of “immaterial assets” protected by copyright as
registered in the books of the relevant economic players, if all of a sudden the term of
protection were shortened? It would decrease the values of such players, and therefore
would have a negative impact on the economic data.
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
There is still a considerable difference among the Member States due to the optional free
use cases and the open end list. This is detrimental to legal safety. However, a number of
the cases of free use as introduced in the Member States have no impact on the internal
market. It is important to note the most significant exceptions that are transposed in the
various legal systems.
  NO – Please explain


  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
In general we are not in favour of the further harmonization. However, it is worth
considering to make mandatory or to provide for more details of those exceptions and
limitations that have been introduced in the overwhelming majority of the Member
States (e.g. free private reproduction + mandatory compensation).

degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain why
The EU regulatory framework is sufficiently flexible. The Member States may choose
from a rich menu that includes all the limitations and exceptions that existed in the
Member States’ copyright law at the time of the adoption of the Infosoc Directive and
the three step test also serves the sophisticated evaluation of the free use cases well. The
jurisprudence of the Member States can rely on this solution without any difficulty. A
greater flexibility would result in a decrease in the level of protection, which should be
high as it is reflected in the Infosoc Directive.
    NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
This problem is solved by the judgement of the ECJ C-462/09 (Stichting de Thuiskopie v
Opus Supplies Deutschland GmbH) stating that (…) “the provisions of the Directive on
copyright impose on a Member State which has introduced the private copying
exception into its national law an obligation to achieve a certain result, meaning that it
must guarantee, within the framework of its competences, the effective recovery of the
fair compensation intended to compensate the authors harmed by the prejudice
sustained, in particular if that harm arose on the territory of that Member State". In
plain words even if the sale of media that is subject to private copy remuneration is sold
in the territory of another Member State, the fair compensations shall be collected in the
                                                                                            20
Member State, where the media is sold. The enforcement of the right to the fair
compensation is subject to jurisdiction and court enforcement rules. The problem of
applicable law has been excellently solved by the Opus decision.



Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

2.      Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

In the event of the introduction of off-premises access, serious technical difficulties arise.
The identification of the user, as well as the monitoring of the observing of the scope of
the licensed use, will constitute serious obstacles. Safe technical solutions would need
vast investments to be made by budget institutions. The technical difficulties go hand in
hand with the legal aspects of the same problems. The transposition of the orphan works
directive may offer a solution with regards to the orphan works. This however brings
the orphan works and the off-premises making available of orphan works in to a more
advantageous situation than that of the “ordinary” works. The cross-border off-
premises access to orphan works will be easier than the access to other works.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
-

35.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
It would be worth considering the introduction of the extended collective licensing of the
off-premises access to library collections. This solution would make the licensing simple
and would eliminate the problem of the unidentified right holders.

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

Distribution of physical copies via libraries does not jeopardize the traditional
publishers' business models, because they do not compete with each other, the library
services cannot be conducted commercially per definitionem and the public lending
remuneration exists to provide compensation for eventual losses. In the electronic area a
market player can let access to the material in the same way (on similar platforms) as
the libraries, so they compete with each other. Basically, there is not any relevant
difference between them which could support a decision for making the electronic
lending free.
See further the comment to the resale questions.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

4.        Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made

available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

F.       Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from

45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

H.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the

Access is not hindered by the copyright rules - there is a free use (exception) with a

I.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is

51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              28
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
X YES – Please explain
In our view, text and data mining constitutes use in copyright terms. Depending on the
technology chosen by the miner or his/her technical contributor, the behaviour is either
reproduction or falls within the scope of the general rule on the exploitation of works
that is subject to the authorization of the right holder. In the case of databases, Article 7
(5) of the Database Directive is extremely relevant in this respect. (The repeated and
systematic extraction and/or re-utilization of insubstantial parts of the contents of the
database implying acts which conflict with a normal exploitation of that database or
which unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database shall
not be permitted.)
There is not any exception (free use) in this regard. Presumably, such a broad exception
that would permit data and text mining in general would conflict with the Member
States’ international obligations.

54.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It would be conceivable to introduce the rule of a properly defined free text/data mining
for educational or scientific purposes without permitting the making of a permanent
copy. It should be clear that privileged data (personal data, trade secrets etc.) shall not
be subject to the exception, and the exclusive database right with regards to the
insubstantial parts of databases should not be eroded by the exception. In addition -
with due regard to the sensitive, privileged data - TPM should be privileged in relation
to a possible new exception. Commercial uses should not fall within the scope of the
text/data mining. It is worth considering also applying the exception of the citation to the
data mining. It would mean that the indication of the source (respect of moral rights) as
well as the proportionality of the citation could also be applied to the new eventual
exception of data mining.
55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
-
56.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

In case of the massive use of specific content that would exceed the scope of the
exception (the justified and proportional use of text and data), the licensing could
happen through a collecting society for a remuneration.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
We do not have any knowledge about other barriers.

J.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and




                                                                                           30
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

UGC is anonymous. The enforcement of copyright against consumers that infringe
copyright is either not possible or is viable only through a NTD procedure. It is still
unclear after the Promusicae, LSG and Bonnier decisions, in which cases and to what
extent the data of infringing private persons can be claimed in civil proceedings.
Rightholders are not remunerated at all or rarely, even though the intermediary
platforms generate usually serious receipts by operating UGC platforms.

   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound

sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

in voluntary framework agreements between right holders and users. Due to the
immaturity of the topic, self-regulation seems a particularly appropriate instrument.
62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]



                                                                                           32
The non commercial purpose of consumers is not relevant. The use of works and other
protected subject matter requires authorisation anyway. In addition, the mass non-
commercial uses do have a seriously negative impact on the licensed lawful services.
The authorization of the acts of every single consumer is impossible. Therefore, it can be
considered whether a compensated narrow exception regarding reproduction,
communication and eventual adaptation could be introduced in conjunction with the
exclusive licensing right or the remuneration right to be introduced towards the
operators of the UGC platforms (please see below).
Such an exception should not and may not cover moral rights (in particular the right of
integrity). Moral rights can be enforced via the existing NTD procedures if such
procedures can be broadened by a stay down obligation.
A possible solution may be if the exception does not cover the adaptation right and, in
this case, both the assertion of the adaptation right and the moral rights can happen via
the NTD procedures if such procedures can be broadened by a stay down obligation.
The platforms offering UGC services are commercial and also include usages
(reproduction and/or communication to the public) that could in no way be considered
as UGC.
The platforms offering UGC services should either obtain the necessary licences with
regards to their communication to the public and/or the reproduction that occurs via
these platforms or these usages should be made subject to a remuneration right to be
exercised via mandatory collective management (this limitation of the exclusive right
would compensate the possible exception to be introduced for the benefit of the
consumers generating the UGC).

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies

made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain
The case law of the European Court of Justice (Padawan-, Opus-, Amazon-, Kyocera
cases, and the future decisions in ACI Adam and CopyDan cases) can in principle be
codified. However, the practice clearly reflects occasional problems that cannot
comprehensively be regulated. All in all, the codification is not necessary due to the
practice of the CJEU.
If the harmonization and further legislation would be put on the agenda, the first step in
any further harmonization should be that all Member States introduce these private
copy remunerations.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
X YES – Please explain
The licensing of the making of digital copies in systems that include the private copy
remuneration and make private digital copying free is legally impossible. If there is an
exception, the scope of the license may not cover the usage that is the subject-matter of
the exception. In other words, if there is no restricted act, there is no room for licensing.
Please also see VG Wort v. Kyocera that clarified the relationship between licensed uses
and the remuneration right. As a consequence, the licensing and the private copy
remuneration go hand in hand. The border of the scope of the license is that the licensee
may make possible the download of the work or other subject-matter. The copying of
the downloaded content is subject to the remuneration.
     NO – Please explain

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Diversity of online services does not allow for fully integrated solutions. The
reproductions which are subject to the remuneration and which must be licensed by the
right holder will depend on the business model. However, it should be clarified that, in
the case that the private copying is included (offered) in the cloud services, it should be
remunerated. What is decisive is the Padawan ruling stating that: private copying could
be made not only by digital reproduction equipment, devices and media but also by
copying services.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
     YES – Please explain
X NO – Please explain
In Member States where the tariffs are publicly available, it would mean an unnecessary
extra burden and additional administrative cost. The regulation of the question does not
need an EU level action.
     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
X NO – Please explain

OPUS decision applies, and such a party is liable to provide data and pay the

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]

In Hungary the private copy remuneration and the reprography levy do not cover
private reproduction only, but extend to some institutional copying acts, so the question
should be evaluated in this context. A certain percentage of the remuneration is paid
with regards to free reproductions other than private copying but subject to the
remuneration. Nonetheless, the applicable Tariff Chart includes a professional a priori
exemption covering non re-writable media if the party obliged to pay the remuneration
can certify with appropriate documents that the media will and may not be used for
private copying. In cases of re-writable media, the use of the media for private copying
can never be excluded.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant

62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           36
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The introductory text of this question covers a very broad spectrum of problems, but an
acute problem can be detected mainly in respect of the right of making available of
performing artists. In this regard, there are significant differences between Member
States, particularly with regard to transferability. In Hungary, it is an exclusive and
transferable right, managed collectively, so the transfer may only be exercised in cases
where the right holder withdraws his/her making available right from collective
management. In other cases, the collecting society may claim remuneration for the use.
However, there are several problems in practice with regards to the exercise of this
making available right.
It would be worthwhile considering the introduction of a remuneration of which the
performing artist cannot waive and which is not subject to transfer, so the performing
artist could get a share from the revenue of any use. In the case of such an EU-wide
solution, it should be left to the Member States to decide about the transferability of the
exclusive right that would leave intact the remuneration right of the performing artist.
All performing artists (audiovisual and musical performing artists) fight with this
problem, which needs a general solution.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
X YES – Please explain
Contract law is fundamentally different in the Member States, since the vast majority of
these provisions are not harmonized. Because the possible introduction of a standstill
clause would not necessarily apply in the same way in all Member States, while
selecting one of these solutions it should be treated with special care. Also, the statutory
and case law background of the licensing agreements deserve special attention.

[Open question]



     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
X YES – Please explain
The new enforcement system has not yet been fully tested since the transposition of
Directive 2004/48/EC, which is due to the slow movement of the legal system. There has
not been much case law since the 2006 implementation. Therefore, not all tools could
have been fully tested so far. Thus, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether the
system is effective or not with regards to commercial scale infringements.
However, it can be said that the current toolbar is not suitable for the online
infringements.
     NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,

of intellectual property rights.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           38
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The role of intermediaries in the current system is essentially limited to the notice and
take down proceedings since, because the provision of information (data of infringers)
may not be ensured in civil enforcement, the filtering is outside of the possible sanctions
and the NTD may pre-empt the injunction. It requires a fast reaction, but it is not
effective enough to prevent further infringements. Therefore, the introduction of other
devices should be necessary, in particular by strengthening the role of intermediaries. In
most cases they have technical / IT tools, which would suppress the infringements
effectively.
Thus, it is particularly important to strengthen the commitment of the entire chain of
intermediaries. It would be useful to make clear the liability rules (i.e. the hosting
provider does not carry out editing activities).

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
X NO – Please explain
According to the case law of the European Court of Justice, the legislative solution for
finding the right balance is not uniform in the Member States’ law. In many Member
States, the courts cannot require the intermediaries to share personal data on the basis
of the request for information, which ultimately means that copyright law absolutely
cannot prevail over the protection of personal data. Therefore, it would be appropriate
to harmonize at EU level the criteria for the disclosure of personal data. The LSG and
Bonnier decision provide a good basis for that.
  NO OPINION

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
X NO

                                                                                           39
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The idea of a European copyright title reflects the idea of the single market. However,
on the copyright markets we cannot speak about a single internal market in general. In
some areas (especially for transborder online uses) it is an attainable goal, but in other
areas it is not the ambition of the market players, either. Even in relation to the online
area, it should also be stated that most services are not aimed at the whole territory of
the EU, but several Member States.
Because of this situation, the single European copyright title cannot replace the national
protection that is anyway part of the property system of the Member States.
The parallel existence of the EU level and national level protection - similar to some
fields of industrial property law – would be significantly impeded, as the EU and its
Member States are contracting parties of international agreements that exclude the
formality conditions of protection attached to the protection of the contracting
countries. The national and EU protection could not be separated from each other
without a registration similar to the registration of the industrial property rights.
Moreover, Art 118 of the TFEU does not constitute a proper legal ground to introduce a
single Copyright Title. paragraph (2) clearly refers to language regimes and the relevant
decision making. From this reference, it is clear that the entire provision may only apply
to industrial property rights.
The content and the regulatory approach and method of the national copyright laws are
determined by the cultural, social and economic characteristics of the Member States,
that do not seem to converge. It is to be feared that a unified European copyright title
would abolish these national characteristics / values.
Therefore, the establishment of European copyright title is premature and unnecessary
at the moment.
