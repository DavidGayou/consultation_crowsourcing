Introduction

Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms,
for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as
research and for citizenswho now expect to be able to access
content – for information, education or entertainment purposes
– regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuringthat the EU copyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its"Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:on the one
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication(2012)789.

with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table
legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder
dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress.Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledges to be a further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and
text and data mining – did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of
"Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on
Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality in
the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions
to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU
copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in
the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European Council Conclusions5

EUCO 169/13, 24/25 October 2013.

"Providing digital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review
of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important
to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)
466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011) 427
final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.

and "Content Online"8

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination
of knowledge, and rightsholders’ remuneration, particularly in
the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders
representing all stages in the value chain, including right
holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions
elicited widely diverging views on the best way toproceed. The
"Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was
followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights
ManagementDirective and into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights
involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely
harmonisedby the existing EU Directives. However, differences
remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is
thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and
enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller –therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightsholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
servicescan be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery of
multi-territorial licences in musical works for online
services11

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licenseddirectly by
right holders such as film or record producers or by newspaper
or book publishers.

; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12

You can find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further developmentof cross-border
portability14

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services thatare made available in Member States other than the
one in which they live. Not all online services are available in
all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances,
even if the “same” service is available in all Member States,
consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access
the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected
to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State,
the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and
newspapers, games, applications and other software)

 NO

Where pan-European exploitation of works is not possible, the
barrier to this does not lie with the copyright framework.
Instead, authors or foreign co-publishers may decide that
theyonly want their works to be exploited in certain
territories and thus will only grant publishers rights
accordingly. There have also been instances where the
difficulty for consumers in one EU nation to access services of
another have been due to the technical deficiencies in the
retailer platform, often connected with difficulties in
performing exchange rate conversion. Again, copyright is not
part of the problem.

It is our view therefore that no further measures are needed at
EU level to increase the cross-border availability of books in
the Single Market, in either physical or ebook format.

[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
in the EU?

 YES - Please explainwhether such problems, in your
experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.
business decisions relating to the cost of providing services
across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premium content such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
software).

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO  See answer to 1 above. There are adequate licensing
solutions available to provide cross-border access.

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder or a
collectivemanagement organisation:]How often are you asked to
grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible,
the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating
the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.


[Openquestion]

The majority of publishing contracts entered into by our 9000
members (all professional authors) contain licences of multi-
territorial rights. This does not cause significant problems in
practice except that sometimes publishers demand rights which
they then fail to exploit.

If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

[Inparticular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

Where there is demand and a business case, cross border
licensing already takes place within the European Union.
Whereproblems do arise they are not to do with copyright but
factors such as:

-contractual arrangements: such as the licensee not wishing to
purchase rights for more than one territory or because the
service provider is not equipped to provide services in all
territories,

-cultural differences between consumers: where there is no
demand in some territories,

-language differences, meaning that books will need to be
translated for many territories,

-limitations on online retail technology resulting from exchange
rates or taxation

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service
provider:]Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
acquired all the necessary rightsfor all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

YES – Please explain by giving examples

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO

 NO OPINION

Do you think that further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at
EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

 YES – Please explain

…We agree that further measures are needed but not in the
field of copyrightwhere flexible market led solutions have been
developed. It is for service providers and commercial users to
choose what creative content they want, which is not a
copyright issue. However, it is our viewthat other aspects of
cross-border availability ofcontent services should be
addressed such as payment measures, VAT, etc.

 NO – Please explain

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?[The
definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on thelegal protection of computer
programs.

and databases18

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/ECharmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightsholders19

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”,while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20

The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanentreproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user
downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to
thepublic/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise
or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital
networks21

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis coveredby the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public22

See in particular Case C-173/11(Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09
(Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

. According to this approachthe copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service
provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

Isthe scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

 YES

 NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what
type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"
approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23

The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is
to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin",which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and
rights related to copyright applicable to satellite
broadcasting and cable retransmission).

)

8.1  Making available should beunderstood to take place in both
the country of upload and all countries where the content can
be accessed (not just those that are ‘targeted’ by a website).
This is not 100% clear at present because there is no CJEU
judgment to confirm it. Reasons why theright applies in country
of upload and all countries where accessible are:

(a) The making available right in the WIPO Copyright Treaty
covers the ‘entire transmission up to the terminal from which
the member of the public gets access’ (The WIPO Treaties1996,
Reinbothe and von Lewinski, (2002), p. 108).

(b) A ‘country of origin’ model would allow infringing sites to
evade rights holders by moving servers to countries with poor
copyright enforcement. Licensing would also be subject to
regulatory arbitrage.

(c) Server location may change or involve multiple countries,
making ‘country of origin’ overly complex to administer for
licensing purposes.

(d) It is often difficult to say whether a copyright-infringing
website targets a given country.

(e) Targeting is irrelevant to whether the site is prejudicing
the rights holders’ rights. Consumers access and download from
illegal sites whether or not the site is in a given language or
has advertising using a certain currency. In this respect,
infringement of the making available right is different from
infringing other rights, such as trade marks, where the
negative business effect is subsequent to the internet
activity.

8.2  We believe that clarification is needed on the overlap
between the making available rightand rights granted under the
Rental and Lending Directive. For example there is confusion as
to whether downloading of ebooks from outside library premises
may constitute "communication to the public" rather than
"lending".

a).  Recital 10 of the Rentaland Lending Directive says“(10) It
is desirable, with a view to clarity, to exclude from rental
and lending within the meaning of this Directive certain forms
of making available, as for instance making available
phonograms or films for the purpose of public performance or
broadcasting, making available for the purpose of exhibition,
or making available for on-the-spot reference use. Lending
within the meaning of this Directive should not include making
available between establishments which are accessibleto the
public.”There is no exclusion there for remote lending.

b)  Lending is defined as“1(b) "lending" means making available
for use, for a limited period of time and not for direct or
indirect economic or commercial advantage, when it is made
throughestablishments which are accessible to the public”

These provisions are distinctly unclear but when considering
“when it is made through establishments which are accessible
to the public”. there is no obvious reason for reading
“through” as suggestingthat it only includes physical
attendance at a library. Remote borrowing is also carried out
“through” a library and it seems that remote ebook lending is
a rental right. This should be clarified.

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief24

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

 NO

 NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed
in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licenceswhen the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

 NOLicensing different rights together is normal in many
fields, not just online and is effective and simple.In some
sectors e.g. publishing, literary and artisticworks there is
currently little distinction between the reproduction and
making available rights. They are exploited simultaneously by
the same rights holder and so do not cause problems in the
online environment.Further, it is beneficial to have these two
separate rights, as they allow for the greatest possible
flexibility: whilst some users may wish to acquire a licence
for and make use of the reproduction right, other users may
wish to add the making available right to their licence.
Keeping these tworights separate causes no identifiable
problems and rather allows the greatest flexibility for
users/would be licensees. To marry them together in a single
act of exploitation would reduce choice for online business
models and ultimately consumers.

As wehave indicated above, there is confusion in relation to the
overlap between lending and making available rights specifically
in library lending of ebooks and it would be helpful to clarify
this. That clarification would not necessitate reopening the
Copyright Directive.

 NO OPINION

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending beforethe CJEU25

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the right holder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU26

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).
See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the right holder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the
case in general,or under specific circumstances, and why

Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an
authorised act should not require additional consent. However,
in certain circumstances, such as the making available of such
content or usage in any otherway (i.e. not temporary or
incidental), it should require the consent of the rights
holders.

 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it does not amount to an act ofcommunication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception).

 NO OPINION

Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the right
holder?

 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the
case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner(e.g. by selling themor by giving them as a gift). The
principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that
tangible article)27

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)28

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in caseof computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisinrelation to the Information Society
Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have
“re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and
delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
market for physicalgoods).

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

NO.

We are extremely concerned that the doctrine of exhaustion might
be applied to digital content and it is our view that this is a
leading question which encourages end users and consumers to
speak of bad experiences. Any such responses must be balanced
against responses to question 14.

Digital content is acquired in a very different way legally from
tangible hardback copies. With a printed book or a physical CD.,
the consumer purchases a tangible object (but not any IPR in the
content) which they can choose to give away or sell as they
wish.But digital content is acquired by a licence – an access
licence – which contains terms as to how, where, when, for how
long and by whom such content can be accessed. So it is wrong
to apply to digital content the conventional thinking about
ownership rights of a print publication. This is skeuomorphism
which obscures the realities of the licensing market. Ebooks
can be priced cheaper than physical books, both because of the
saving of costs associated with the physical property
(manufacturing, storage etc)but also because they will only be
read by the licensee meaning that others will similarly have to
purchase a licence if they wish to access the book. If licences
were to allow free transfer then prices would have to be
increased. This would be to the detriment of the consumer.
Further, the second-hand market is largely indistinguishable
from the first-hand, owing to four characteristics of digital
goods:

Digital works in the second-hand market are identical to the
original of the work only in the sense that they contain the
same work; however, physical works in the second-hand market
are identical in the strictest interpretation of the term
“identical”: i.e. the second-hand work isone and the same
thingas the first-hand work. The only difference is the price
and the fact that creators and publishers will not benefit from
the resale thus cutting their incomes and the incentive and
ability to produce new work.

Digital copies can be numerous, to a near-infinite degree, and
therefore the second-hand market can be larger than the
first-hand market. In the physical world, this is impossible
since the second-hand market can only ever be as large as the
first-hand market andis always likely to actually be smaller.
Given the trivial ease with which Digital Rights Management
tools can behacked and cracked, it is no comfort to say that a
“forward and delete” approach could solve this issue.

Whereas digital copies are and remain pristine and faithful,
physical copies suffer from deterioration- even a book which
has been read once is noticeably different from a new book.
This means that goods in the physical second-hand market are
inferior to the first-hand (increasingly so over time) and so
goods in each market are less substitutable.

the cost of postage andtime taken to deliver mean that there are
frictions in the transfer process of physical books but digital
copies can be transferred instantly and at no cost.

The upshot of these factors is that the ability of the
author/publisher to earn just reward wouldbe severely curtailed
by unrestricted reselling of digital content. Authors receive no
payment for second-hand sales of their work .

Furthermore, the impact on levels of online copyright
infringement would be likely to be significant. Monitoring
unauthorised distribution is difficult enough in the prevailing
conditions; however, it would become untenable to monitor and
track infringement in a newly legitimised second-hand market in
which there was no discernible difference in the product. Pirate
copieswould be indistinguishable from the legitimate copies.

Further, it is more difficult to determine whether a digital
good has been sold; unlike a physical sale where there is a
transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing use
of the physicalgood by the seller, in the digital environment
this is not the case – both the seller and purchaser can
continue to use the digital product. The implications for
widespread copyright infringement – and concurrent difficulties
in enforcement – are clear.

 NO

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]
What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]This would be incompatible with international law
because removing digital resale from rights holder authorisation
would involve creating new copyright exceptions to the
reproduction and communication to the public rights. Neither
are compatible with the Three Step Test as this is not a
“special” case (i.e. it does not have a narrow scope), it
conflicts with normal exploitation and prejudices the
legitimate interests of rights holders.

a)  Initial licences of ebooks and other content would have to
increase vastly to compensate for the huge loss of sales that
would be generated by such a change.

b)  resellers might not destroy originals and this could not be
policed, effectively giving free rein to piracy; and

c)  creators and publishers will not benefit from the resale
thus cutting their incomes and the incentive and ability to
produce new work.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existinginternational treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, thisprohibition is not absolute29

For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works
originating in the country imposingthe formalities as opposed
to works originating in another country.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered30

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

 YES

 NO.The registration and identification of works in the
publishing sector already takes place at a voluntary level via
the ISBN system, created in 1965. We also reject the notion
that registration should be a prerequisite for the protection
and exercise of rights, and any compulsoryregistration system
applicable to foreign works would of course fall foul of the
Berne Convention.

Registration would militate against the small or first-time
creator. The need to register could be perceived as an
administrative burden and thus a disincentive. Registration
would create a two-tier structure of works: those
non-registered would – presumably – be less well protected than
those which were. In all likelihood this would mean that larger,
more established rightsholders would enjoy greater protections
than those new to the field.

The identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter is better served by improvements in facilitating
discoverability; and in the streamlining of licensing.

 NO OPINION

What would be the possibleadvantages of such a system?

None

What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

We cannot see any benefits to be gained from a registration
system in relation to books where good voluntary systems
already exist. As discussed in response to Q15 above, Such a
system is overly complex, costly and would place an additional
burden on rightsholders for no obvious gain –Such a system
could also violate Article 5 of the Berne Convention.

What incentives for registration by rightsholders could be
envisaged?

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are manyprivate databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed‘identifiers’. Identifiers
can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the InternationalStandard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of
rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and inpromoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subjectmatter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The BerneConvention35

Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the
death of theauthor. The EU rules extend this term of protection
to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other
countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
in the digital environment?

 YES – Please explain

The current term of copyright provides a fair balance between
the interests of creators and the right to be remunerated for
their intellectual property and the interest of consumers and
societyin access to knowledge and imagination. A key factor in
striking this balance is average life expectancy, since it is
generally held that an author should at least be rewarded for
the use of work during their own lifetime and at least a part
of that of the estate (likely to be close dependents).
Copyright terms have gradually increased over the past 100
years in reflection of the increased life expectancy of the
population (in the UK in 1911 life expectancy was 51 and 54
years for men and women respectively, compared with 79 and 82
in 2013.

Whether works are being produced, consumed or used in analogue
or digital format is irrelevant to the question of for how long
their creator should be rewarded.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations andexceptions to copyright and related rights enable
the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without
obtaining authorisation from the rightsholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for
illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher
in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a
number of copyright directives, most notably Directive
2001/29/EC36

Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of
databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon thelegal protection of
computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and
lending right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37

Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994;
Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty
(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightsholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in
EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonised at EU level)38

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39

With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)
Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan
Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting
that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the
EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance
in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the
functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rightsis territorial too (so
an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may stillrequire the authorisation of the right holder once we
move to the Member State "B")40

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightsholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a
novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member
States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightsholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightsholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarifythat certain uses are covered by an exception
or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of
rightsholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU
and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the
required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international
obligations.

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are
optional for the Member States?

 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

The limitations provide appropriate flexibilityto deal with the
very different cultural and commercial environments of the
member states.According to Recital 32 of the Copyright
Directive, the rationale for providing an extensive, optional
list of exceptions is to take due account of the differentlegal
traditions and markets in Member States while enabling the
internal market to function. This approach acknowledges the
fact that while rights are granted in a relatively uniform way,
the limitations applied to those rights and any compensation for
such limitation may be applied quite differently. For example,
in the case of a book being copied for educational use, Member
States may permit this subject to a voluntary licence, a
statutory licence or a remuneration scheme. Through the network
of agreements signed between European Reproduction Rights
Organisations, any necessary mandates to copy works are secured
and remuneration is exchanged. In this case the flexible nature
of the exceptions regime enables the educational uses and right
holder paymentsacross the EU.

 NO OPINION

Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so,
is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

 YES – Please explain by referring to specificcases

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

The existing catalogue is already sufficiently flexible and has
worked well in practice in creating a fair balance of rights
and interests. There is noreason to suggest that some or all
copyright exceptions provided for should be mandatory and to
make them so would undo the consensus reached during the debate
that took place at the time the Copyright Directive was
negotiated, which recognised the varying cultural traditions in
each State and therefore the need for flexibility across the EU.
Any attempt to make all exceptions mandatory would also cause
problems of interpretation across Member States, which would by
no means be consensual, unless interpretation of local courts
was restricted in some way (for example interpretation via the
CJEU alone), and at a possible risk to delays in justice and
enforcement of rights.

 NO OPINION

Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed
fromthe existing catalogue?Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

[Open question]

No There is no evidence to suggest that any new limitations and
exceptions should be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue.

It should be remembered that limitations and exceptions are by
their very definition applied only in certain special cases
where the Three Step Test has been complied with and therefore
where there is no properly functioning licensing market. Until
it has been demonstrated why where and how any new limitations
and exceptions might apply, any proposal to interfere with
rightsholders’ exclusive rights remains extremely concerning.

In contrast to licensing solutions, which are being continuously
developed and improved by rightsholders to meet user needs,
exceptions and limitations can only be a blunt and often
ineffective tool.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving41

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42

Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whetherit needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightsholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections ofcultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works,
the copying offragile works - may involve the creation of
another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws
allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope
of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

(a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you
experiencedspecific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections
(or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?

(c)[In particular if you are aright holder:]Have you negotiated
agreements with institutional users that enable those
institutions to provide remote access, including across

It is our experience that such issues are easily solved by
licensing solutions. Any exception would have to satisfy the 3
Step Test and provide fair remuneration to creators,including,
if necessary the extension of Public Lending Right payments to
authors.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Contractual agreements exist between universities/libraries and
publishers to facilitate off-premises (remote) accessto library
collections for the purposes of research and private study. Such
licensing solutions should be extended as necessary with
appropriate payments to creators.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

(a)[In particular if you are alibrary:]Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable
the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of
books or other materials held in your collection?

(b)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you

(c)[Inparticular if you are aright holder:]Have you negotiated

materials electronically, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain with specific examples

The Society of Authors has been very engaged with these
questions and possible solutions in the UK and in Europe. The
UK Government commissioned a thorough study into the question
last year. (The Sieghart
Review)https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/an-independent-review-of-e-lending-in-public-libraries-in-england

The Sieghart Review outlined the issues in detail and
recommended:

•  The provisions in the Digital Economy Act 2010 that extend
PLR to audio books and loans of on-site e-books should be
enacted.

•  Further legislative changes should be made to allow PLR to
take account of remotee-loans.

•  The overall PLR pot should be increased to recognise the
increase in rights holders.

•  A number of pilots in 2013 using established literary
events should be set up to test business models and user
behaviours, and provide a transparent evidencebase: all major
publishers and aggregators should participate in these pilots.

•  Public libraries should offer both on-site and remote
E-Lending service to their users, free at point of use.

•  The interests of publishers and booksellers must be
protected by building in frictions that set 21st-century
versions of the limits to supply which are inherent in the
physical loans market (and where possible, opportunities for
purchase should be encouraged). These frictions include the
lending of each digital copyto one reader at a time, that
digital books could be securely removed after lending and that
digital books would deteriorate after a number of loans. The
exact nature of these frictions should evolve over time to
accommodate changes in technology and themarket.

The Society of Authors broadly agrees with these recommendations
which are beginning to be implemented

 NO

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We believe that any problems can be resolved within the
currentcopyright directives by use of licensing models and (if
necessary) already extant statutory exceptions

1  Publishers must accept that current models for ebook lending
through aggregators are contractually sub-licences, not sales;
and remunerate authors in line with their contractual
obligations for both the “sale” and the “lending” aspect of the
transaction.

2  Any models for elending should remunerate authors per loan as
well as for the “sale” of the ebook.

3  An author’s receipts from ebook lending should equate to the
total earnings the author would have received on a physical
copy over the lifetime of the book from the combination of
royalties on sale and PLR on every loan.

4  If it does not prove possible to remunerate authors fully via
licensing models, further legislative changes should be made to
extend PLR to remote e-loans.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n°
3) and the previous one (n° 2).

[In particular if you are an institutional user:]What
differences do you see in themanagement of physical and online
collections, including providing access to your subscribers?
What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

[In particular if you are a right holder:]What difference do you
see between libraries’ traditional activities such as
on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such
as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and
e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

See 38 and 39 above. We believe that physical local libraries
are at the core of a civilised and cultured society and are
essential for the following reasons:

i)  Fostering Imagination and Creating Readers

ii)  Education and research skills

iii)  Access to knowledge and research

Chris Smith when Secretary of State described public libraries
as “the university of the street corner”. Libraries have been
and will continue to be a powerful resource in supporting
literacy and the acquisition of knowledge and information.

iv)  Access to entertainment

Reading for pleasure remains a favourite pastime of children and
adults in the UK. While books remain cheap when compared to
other forms of entertainment, the cost of regularly buying new
books is out ofthe range of much of the UK population,
particularly those from the most disadvantaged groups.

v)  Community spaces

The library is a safe haven, a source of valuable information, a
centre for education and entertainment, the provider of internet
access and other valued services such as baby and toddler
groups, homework clubs, internet access and home delivery to
the housebound.

Some of the above can be offered by online access but others may
be lost if the focus of libraries switches to e-access and
e-lending. In particular libraries need librarians: the
importance of curated offerings and personal advice and support
cannot be underestimated and we remain strongly of the view that
remote lending of ebooks, while desirable, is not an essential
or primary role of an efficient library service. It also far
more likely than physical or onsite lending to compete with the
sale of ebooks thus destabilising a fragile market. These
problems can be solved by appropriate and sensitive e-licensing
solutions. These solutions are already being tested in many EU
member states and we believe that it would be premature to
introduce further exceptions at this stage. We do however urge
the UK Government to forthwith fulfil its promises to introduce
Public Lending Right paymentsto the provision of audiobooks and
onsite lending ebooks and to consider the extension of PLR to
remote elending.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections
and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples
are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part
of the 20thcenturyor whole collections of pictures of historical
value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by
the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on
the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works
(i.e. works whichare no longer found in the normal channels of
commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural
institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies
representing authors and publishers on the other44

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary
licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the
basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers).
Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of suchlicences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the
licences granted)45

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU.The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars
2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres
indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,
unless the author or publisher in question opposes such
management.The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in
relation to works whose rightsholders are not members of the
collecting society.

.

[In particular if you are an institutional user,engaging or
wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right
holder, a collective management organisation:]Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that
the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded

Teaching

Directive2001/29/EC46

Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow
a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his
course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or
of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation
from the right holders.The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework forthe licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

(a)[In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an
institutional user:]Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use
of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How
successful are they?

[Open question]

We adopt the response of ALCS here: "Educational use is a
high-volume market demanding both quantity and breadth of
material. Facilitating this kind of use requires solutions
involving multiple rightsholders and rights. In the UK such
solutions have been developed by building upon the exceptions
providing for teaching activities.

Section 36 of theCopyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988)
permits educational establishments to copy limited extract from
books, serials and other materials for teaching purposes but
also makes provision for licences covering educational copying.
Through the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) bodies representing
the relevant rightsholders in such works – ALCS for authors,
DACS for artists and PLS for publishers – have developed
schemes enabling far greater uses than those envisaged by the
exception. These include extensionsto digital formats of works,
use of works on smartboards and distance learning via on-line
networks.

Section 35 of the Act permits educational establishments to make
recordings from broadcasts but, like section 36, also allows for
a licensing scheme to operate. Through the Educational Recording
Agency (ERA) ALCS and 19 other bodies representing the various
rightsholders in audiovisual works provide a licensing scheme
covering the different ways that broadcast material is accessed
and used within modern teaching methods. The licensing scheme
has expanded beyond the exception by including new digital
services, such as on-line content delivery, within licensed
repertoire and offering remote access rights to facilitate.

These licences achieve a near 100% penetration within the UK
education sector providing flexible access to hundreds of
thousands of works licensed by thousands of individual
rightsholders. The success of these models is supported by two
key findings from recent research in this area. Firstly, it has
been demonstrated that educational licensing schemes generate
significant costs savings for educational establishments.
Economic analysis within Higher Education has found that the
annual costof clearing secondary use rights for individual
published works would be between £145m - £720m, whereas the
overall annual cost of acollective licence for this sector is
around £6.7m. For schools, the cost of a licence enabling them
to copy and reuse extracts from all the books and serials in
their collections represents 0.03% of their annual spend47

An economic analysis of educational exceptions in
copyright,PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, March 2012, p.52

; the annual cost to a high school of accessing and copying UK
broadcast material is less than 60p per pupil. Secondly, it is
clear that licensing revenue has a key role to play in
sustaining the development of new educational materials.
Economic analysis demonstrates that a reduction in this income
could result in a drop in output amongst authors writing for
the education sector of 29%, equating to an annual shortfall of
2,870 new educational works."

If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
institutions should be covered andunder what conditions?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would
it be?

[Open question]The ALCS experience is that the UK model
outlinedabove provides a solution that sets the right balance
between access rights and rewards for rightsholders to the
overall benefit of the teaching and education sector. This
approach lessens uncertainties around the scope of activities
covered by teaching exceptions by enabling rightsholders to
offer a broad range of material and rights.

Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC49

Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people
with a disability. The open formulation ofthis (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other
subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by
increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)50

The Marrakesh Treaty51

Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,
Marrakesh, June 17 to 28 2013.

has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute
and make available accessible format copies to visually
impaired persons without the authorisation of therightsholders.
The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and
ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain
provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate
accessibility to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]

We support the detailed response on this point submitted by
thePublishers Association."The UK – and EU – has adequate
legislation that sits alongside a robust licensing framework to
allow for the distribution of works to the visually impaired. In
the UK publishers enjoy a strong working relationship with the
RoyalNational Institute for the Blind and publishers support
the following initiatives to make their works accessible to the
widest possible audience:

Publishers mandate theCopyright Licensing Agency(via
thePublishers Licensing Society) to provide licences, at no fee
in most cases, that enable the production ofaccessible copies of
copyright works for Reading Impaired People, but which also
include important controls on authorised uses. The CLA Print
Disability Licence launched in May 2010 with the support of the
publishing industry and the PA, allows copyright works to be
converted into accessible formats, reproduced and distributed
to reading impaired people, but under secure conditions and
only for their personal use. The licence also facilitates the
use of such works by people with dyslexia.

The PA has produced its own guidance:The Publisher Guidelines
for Meeting Permissions Requests on Behalf of Reading Impaired
People.These Guidelines, which include a model licence, have
been developed to help publishers respond more effectively to
requests for access to digital files on behalf of people with
reading impairments.

The PA collaborates with JISC TechDis, an advisory service
focusing on technology and inclusion, to promote accessibility
causes. The two main outcomes from this collaboration so far
have beena website,Publisher Lookup UK,and a guidance document,
theGuide to Obtaining Textbooks in Alternative Formats.Both are
designed to support educational institutions with the provision
of accessible versions of textbooks for the reading impaired.

The PAand other representative bodies released a joint
recommendation to publishers in October 2010 encouraging the
use of accessibility functions on e-reading devices. The
recommendation goes some way to enabling people with reading
impairments to access the same text via e-readers as those
without disabilities. Research is also ongoing into the extent
to which text to speech and other accessibility formats are now
being applied to bestselling titles.

A quarterlyPublisher Accessibility Newsletter52

http://www.pls.org.uk/services/accessibility1/Pages/accessibilitynewsletter.aspx?PageView=Shared

produced in partnership with PLS aggregates recent news and
developments within the publishing industry on accessibility
issues, updating on the progress of legislation, pilot
projects, new initiatives and individual publisher activity.

Delivered byRNIBandDyslexia Action,Load2Learnis a free online
resource which improves the school experience for learners who
can't read standard print by providing an extensive online
collection of educational materials. Members can access over
2,300 titles including textbooks and 2,400 images downloadable
as accessible documents. Load2Learn also offers its members a
book request service for titles not yet available on the site.

The success of existing licensing and collaboration is clear
from RNIB commissioned research into the availability of
accessible versions of the most popular books in the UK. This
research revealed that in 2012, 84 per cent of the top 1,000
titles were available in Braille, audio and largeprint formats
thanks to accessible eBooks, which are opening up the world of
reading for blind and partially sighted readers.

Publishers are also participating in global initiatives to
increase access. The TIGAR project enables Trusted
Intermediaries (TIs) to request accessible versions of books
from participating TIs in other countries. For each request the
project’s ‘permissions clearance co-ordinator’ seeks permission
clearance from rightsholders, and on receipt of this,
electronic files are exchangedthrough secure and transparent
processes. These files are then made available to print
disabled members of the ‘receiving’ TIs through their existing
services.

This enables each TI to make a massive increase in the choice of
books available to its members without major production costs
and reduces unnecessary duplication of effort.

has now developed and implemented a new ICT solution to
facilitate the search, discovery and exchange of electronic
files for accessible books held in existing collections of
participating trusted intermediaries (TIs). Data for over
200,000 titles from TIs in Canada, USA, Sweden, Denmark,
Norway, Australia, Switzerland, and Brazil is already included
in this global, online catalogue and New Zealand, South Africa
and France willbe added shortly. New TIs in Iceland, Portugal
and Switzerland have also recently signed up and more are
expected over coming months.

Plans are also being prepared to further develop and extend the
technology solutions. These will include enabling printdisabled
people to find and buy accessible versions of books from
commercial suppliers, and trials of the use of publisher EPUB 3
files by TIs to add enhanced accessibility features or produce
different formats. "

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics53

For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data
mining” will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that tomine protected works or other
subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such
authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”54

See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine
materialto which access has been provided through a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception
for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the
basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use anddistribute content at little to no financial cost.
As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing
rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated
content”. While users can create totally original content, they
can also take oneor several pre-existing works, change something
in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to
platforms and blogs55

A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording),
oradding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in
a blog.

. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification
ofpre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results
from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity
is not“new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to beaddressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightsholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightsholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged
byrightsholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions56

Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying57

Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) ofDirective 2001/29.

. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods
typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightsholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context,levies are important for rightsholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store
multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and
her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightsholders
whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider
already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could
potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees58

Communication "Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in
Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António
Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies. You can consultthese recommendations on the

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results inobstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the
productsubject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or
business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue
payments63

Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
numberof exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights.
There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to producers64

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract65

See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised thatauthors and performers are
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation ofyour
works and performances?

[Open question]

A combination of contract and legislative measures

The Society of Authors welcomes the publication of the
study"Contractual arrangements applicable to creators: law and
practice of selected Member States"carried out by the Policy
Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs at
the request of the Committee on Legal Affairs ("the Study").
The Study shows conclusively that the UK is lacking the legal
frameworks which protect creators in many other EU countries.
It also shows that EU creators are often subject to onerous
contracts and do not receive a fair share of the reward for
their creativity.The Study makes wide-ranging and practical
recommendations for change which we wholly endorse.

Contracts:

Legislation to enforce fairer and clearer contracts including:

written contracts which set out the exact scope of the rights
granted,

proper accounting clauses, including
regularreportingobligationson both publishers and sublicensees
detailingallexploitationsundertakenandrevenuesyielded.

The Study says"Revenuesandprofitmarginsofdigitalcontentproviders

fair remuneration for all exploitation(which may prevent

limited licences which can be changed as technologies develop.

A partial way to achieve this suggestion would be to extend the
Unfair Contract Terms Act to intellectual property contracts.

Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE66

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text67

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the newchallenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement
measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for
copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose68

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure69

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

No. We adopt the view of the Publishers Association here"The PA
shares the view of the Commission that there is no need for the
E-Commerce Directive to be reopened, we nevertheless believe
that improvements can be made within theexisting Directive
framework, and which would have a significant impact on
reducing copyright infringement.

Notice and Take Down

Overall the E-Commerce Directive provides a strong and workable
framework for notice and Take down. However,a lack ofclarity
can currently prevent expeditious action by giving those who
wish to avoid taking action upon notification an excuse for
doing so. The EU has an important role to play in setting and
issuing best practice guidelines and non binding minimum
standards to ensure the Directive can be used effectively and
with confidence by all players.

This could include specification on the following:

Providing guidance on a definition of ‘expeditious removal’

Urging all sites to proactively remove infringing content if it
has already been reported to them once

Defining a best practice that sites ban repeat infringers

Intermediaries, in particular search engines, need to do more to
inhibit online copyright infringement, for example by de-ranking
links in search results when the site in question has been the
subject of numerous notice and take down actions."

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been
present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only mannerin which a truly Single Market for content protected
by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same
objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level
of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of
flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?

 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in
the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

Other issues

The abovequestionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive
consultation on the most important matters relating to the
current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could
bring them to our attention,so they can be properly addressed
in the future.

Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such
matters should be addressed.

Authors recognise that it is essential for copyrightto keep pace
with technological developments but firmly believe that to do
this the framework that has been established under the
Copyright Directive 2001/29 must remain as the secure basis
from which policy is developed.

It is therefore of fundamental importance that that examination
of issues in the area of copyright does not lead to a reopening
of the Copyright Directive. The Copyright Directive provides the
framework for the other issues to be debated and appropriate
policies developed.

The CopyrightDirective has proved to be sufficiently flexible to
adapt to the changing environment, providing a framework within
which issues can be debated and appropriate policies developed.
It should be allowed to stand. Furthermore, we note the
increasing numberof decisions by the Court of Justice of the
European Union interpreting the Copyright Directive, thus
supporting a harmonised approach to copyright throughout the
European Single Market. Any changes to the underlying framework
endanger this harmonisation.

It is vital that this framework remains in place to provide a
clear basis from which copyright based industries within EU
Member States can continue to develop new and innovative
communication models that will be world leaders.

So far the combination oflicensing and exceptions promoted by
the Directive has provided an excellent solution to most
issues, and within the Licences for Europe stakeholder debates,
licensing is being successfully streamlined for the needs of the
digital environment.

On a practical level, the Copyright Directive has only been in
place since 2001. It was, reputedly, one of the most lobbied
Directives of all time and it took close to five years to get
it adopted. The uncertainty engendered by a prolonged period of
review (in thelight of history) and revision, that re-opening
the Directive would cause would be damaging to all
stakeholders, but to the creative industries in particular and
should be avoided.

In the absence of proven failure, re-opening the Copyright
Directive would be premature.
