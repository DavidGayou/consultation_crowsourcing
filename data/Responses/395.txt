Linking and browsing

11 - Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under  copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES


Download to own digital content

14 - [In particular if you are a right holder or a service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please  specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.


The consequences are wide and without any control. The difference between  a
new digital content and a “second-hand” one is impossible  to  see  for  the
customer. Establishing a kind of blind mark attesting that  a  digital  book
is “new” could be an answer. But I think it's impossible to control.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15 Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

      YES
      NO
      NO OPINION

17 What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


18 What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]






Term of protection – is it appropriate?
20 - Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in  the
digital environment?
YES

User-generated content (UGC) –

58 - (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other  subject
matter  to  disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,  including  across
borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


Not yet.








60 - (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to  be  remunerated  for
the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?


NO.


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?




Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72 - [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

The proportional remuneration. For a book, that means being paid  in  regard
of a certain number of pages. And still having the  possibility  to  discuss
the price.

73 - Is there a need to act at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?
YES – In order to avoid every abuses and misuses, and protect authors.





A single EU Copyright Title

78 - Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and  exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

NO !!! Because it would unfairly reduce everything.






Other issues

80 - Are  there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright?  Please  explain  and  indicate  how  such  matters
should be addressed.

More discussions about the digital market, yes... but  hard  to  explain  in
one sentence.
