   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

    Zentralverband Informationstechnik und Computerindustrie e.V. ("ZItCo")
    is an interest group representing about 100 Producers, Importers and
    Vendors of Personal Computers and related hardware products. Our member
    companies are small and medium sized companies (SMEs) who's
    administration and production facilities are located in Germany. In
    general they are owned by their founders or founder families, and run
    by their owners. Oftentimes production takes place in remoter areas of
    Germany with underdeveloped public and private infrastructure and above
    average unemployment rates. In theses cases ZItCo's members are the
    main employers and main tax payers in their region, with a significant
    responsibility for their workforce and local and regional communities.
    Overall our members are best described with the German expression
    "Mittelstand".


    ZItCo-members are heavily affected by copying levies and similar
    tariffs imposed on devices like PCs, Tablets, Mobile Phones,
    Harddrives, CD-./DVD-Burners and Media such as USB-Sticks, CD-Rom etc.






  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)



Example: eBooks  (namely  of  amazon)  "bought"  in  one  country  can't  be
read/"disappear" while staying in/travelling to another EU-country

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,

      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.

   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]





To tackle the issues named above,  a  legal  regime  should  not  allow  for
territorial restrictions for the grants of rights within EU.


Under German trademark law  and  copyright  law,  if  a  protected  work  is
distributed on a physical medium (such as Music on CD, a book, etc.) it  can
be legally distributed within all of EU without the  consent  of  the  right
holder(s), s. § 17 sec. 2 of  the  German  Copyright  Law:  "(2)  Where  the
original or copies of the work have been brought to the market by sale  with
the consent of the person entitled to distribute them within  the  territory
of the European Union or  another  state  party  to  the  Agreement  on  the
European Economic Area, their dissemination  shall  be  permissible  …"  (so
called "Erschöpfungsgrundsatz").


Such rule should apply also if a protected work is distributed online.


Recent ruling by the ECJ state so for the  distribution  of  software;  that
should be clarified and extended.

   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")





The two rights are regularly exercised by different collecting societies
who have different policies on licensing "their" rights; the
differentiation requires double payments (license fees) on by users and
intermediaries; the cost of rights administration doubles.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)



Such rule would negatively affect the  way  communication  (and  freedom  of
speech) is  exercised  in  "the  internet".  Many  effective  and  necessary
services such as search and platform services would not be possible.

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)



If so, to watch a video stream could become an illegal activity by  a  user,
who regularly has  no  possibilities  to  determine,  whether  a  stream  is
"legal" or "illegal".

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

mass-rightsholders (such as the music  majors)  and  specialised  law  firms
aggressively mass-attack those, who do so, including private users.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

kind an "open", adjustable exception like the fair use regime known from  US
and common law copyright should be adopted

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€YES – Please explain why





Current copyright concepts were developed long  ago,  in  "analogue"  times;
they do not live up to the significant, fast paced change of  the  usage  of
content in modern societies. The emergence of the internet and  the  lasting
phenomenon of "user generated content" and  the  different,  generally  new,
active reception of  content  asks  for  rules,  that  do  not  hinder  such
creative use of content. However, todays copyright rules aim at  prohibiting
third party  use,  drastically  sanction  any  non-consented  use  and  over
emphasise the position of authors and rights holders in general. This is  to
the profit of few, mostly huge multi national companies, who,  historically,
have built up  huge  rights  catalogues.  In  general,  authors,  musicians,
artists etc. do not adequately participate in the  huge  profits  made  with
"their" works and by these companies.


Collecting Societies, at least in Germany, also  distribute  their  earnings
very intransparently, and  mostly  to  privileged  members;  e.g.,  GEMA  of
Germany pays 65 % of its earnings to only 5% of its members) , see here:

      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]



Copyright matters  are  heavily  disputed  in  Germany,  between  collecting
societies, authors and rights holders, producers of hardware  such  as  PCs,
scholars, users, and other stakeholders. This results in lengthy and  costly
court proceedings, that oftentimes involve the ECJ and come at a  very  high
cost. Alternative procedures, such  as  the  German  Arbitration  Board  for
Copyright Matters, have not proven effective, mostly as of today the  German
collecting societies never have accepted a decision by this body as final  /
binding. Thus, this procedure has only prolonged the already  lengthy  court
procedures.

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to



Territoriality provides for different market environments  in  different  EU
states and as such affects the exchange of goods  and  services  between  EU
members states / the single market.


An example are the very different levels of copying levies,  which  lead  to
significantly different end users prices for goods  such  as  PCs,  Tablets,
Mobile Phones, MP3-Players, CD-Roms, BluRay-Disk etc.

  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]



1.
First  it  should  be  noted  that  it  is  questionable  if  any  kind   of
compensation for copyright exceptions is legally required  and  economically
useful at all.

In many EU states, incl. large markets  like  the  UK  and  Spain,  no  such
compensation regime exists; this includes EU states,  that  have  exceptions
to copyrights such as the private copying exception. The underlying  believe
is  that  markets  regulate  compensation  and  should  not  be  affected  /
regulated in doing so. A copy of a protected work that  comes  with  certain
rights such as the right to privately  copy  the  work,  will  automatically
score a higher market price, as it constitutes a "better" and more  valuable
product for the consumer (buyer). In  accordance  with  this,  studies  have
found that media works such as Films and Music, that come  with  restrictive
DRM and thus technically prevent being copied, trade at  lower  prices  then
the same and comparable works without such DRM limitations.

Also, any compensation scheme imposed by  the  legislator  will  come  at  a
significant administrative cost, that will lead to a lesser demand  for  the
work/product due to its higher price to the consumer. At the same time  this
will reduce payments to rightsholders.

Finally, its has to be considered, that when levies were introduced  in  the
1960’s on analogous audio and video recorders and magnetic tapes, there  was
the assumption that nearly every audio and video recorder used  the  product
for private copying. This private copying assumption for  analogue  hardware
does not hold true in todays technological -- digital --  environment.  PCs,
Tablets, Mobile  Phones  are  multifunctional  devices  that  are  used  for
various purposes, most of which are irrelevant for levies.

This all calls for the complete abolition of any system of copying levies,
which is recommended by many experts because of its positive effects on
efficiency and cost, and the free trade within the single market, which is
to the benefit of authors and rights holders a s well. At the same time,
this has almost no negative effects on the authors and rightsholders. E.g.
Prof. Martin Kretschmer (Professor of Information Jurisprudence, Director
of the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy & Management,
www.cippm.org.uk, Bournemouth University), who has conducted extensive
empirical research and analysis for the UK Intellectual Property Office in
2011, is therefor strongly promoting this scenario; pls see
http://www.cippm.org.uk/alcs_study.html

2.
However, if, for  policy  reasons,  a  legislative  compensation  scheme  is
considered to be necessary, such scheme  has  to  be  transparent  and  cost
effective. Also, it has to be neutral to the Single Market  and  competition
within the Single Market. To address issues of transparency,  administrative
cost and negative effects on competition and the Single  Market,  ZItCo  has
already suggested a complete overhaul and renewal of  the  copyright  levies
system on the EU level.

ZItCo suggests to introduce an European Agency, that decides on the  overall
amount of compensation to  be  paid  out  to  copyright  holders,  based  on
statistical data from Eurostat on the numbers of leviable devices  used  for
private copying, and their (estimated) actual usage for such  copying.  From
this data the agency should calculate a  fair  and  economically  reasonable
total amount to be paid out to rights  holders  as  compensation  for  their
losses of direct licensing fees.

The allocation of the amount to be collected to the rights holders  of  each
country would basically be determined  by  the  amounts  collected  in  each
country; however, adjustments could  be  considered  to  take  into  account
differences in the respective economies etc.

The allocation of the levies to  the  different  groups  of  rights  holders
(music composers, authors, etc.) and their respective  collecting  societies
in each country could be done through the  traditional  system  of  national
collecting societies.

Also, the national collection societies (or preferably one  national  agency
acting for all collecting societies of a country) would be  responsible  for
the collection of the levies from the debtors in their respective country.

Debtors of the levies should be the users/end customers of  devices  subject
to the levies, i.e. the private consumers using such devices  and  therefore
profiting from private copying. However, for practical  reasons  the  levies
would  be  collected  not  from  individuals,  but  from  the   (registered)
households.  Such  generalization  is  necessary,  and  justified   on   the
assumption, that as of today each household within the EU owns a  PC  and/or
other copying devices and media and profits from private copying.

For reasons of fairness and transparency, as well as market and  competition
neutrality, and to reduce  administrative  and  transaction  costs,  copying
levies should be directly collected from the end users  (private  consumers)
only,  who  (only)  profit  from  private  copying  and  cause   "harm"   to
rightsholders.  For  practical  reasons,  generalizations   are   necessary,
calling for a per household fee ("Haushaltsabgabe").

We expect  the  system  suggested  here  to  be  fair,  practical  and  cost
efficient. A similar system has  recently  been  introduced  in  Germany  to
collect  the  fees  for   public   service   TV   and   radio   (so   called
"Haushaltsabgabe"  /  per-houshold-fee).  As  of  today,  such   system   is
suggested for Austria as  well  (see  http://www.modernes-urheberrecht.at/).
It would drastically increase legal certainty, it  would  avoid  all  market
and competition disturbances of the single EU market, and it would  lead  to
a just and equal debit of (only)  those  users,  who  actually  profit  from
private copying; at the same time it would  provide  full  transparency  and
ensure speedy pay outs to rightsholders.

A  levy  system  as  outlined  would  not  negatively  affect  cross  border
transactions and sales  and  would  not  require  any  special  adjustments.
However, a levy system  based  on  national  legislation  will  always  face
double levies, costly reimbursement procedures, and ineffective  enforcement
of  cross  border  payments  ("Opus"  decision  of  the  European  Court  of
Justice).

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].

      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain



The use of educational material (e.g. school  books)  is  heavily  regulated
and subject of many long lasting high  level  court  procedures.  Collecting
societies such as GEMA and VG Wort heavily monetize on the  complicated  and
intransparent legal situation by basically "double  billing"  for  the  same
rights through multi-million EUR agreements with the cultural  institutions,
schools, universities and  children  day  care  institutions  and  with  the
ministries of culture on  regional/national  levels,  as  well  as  charging
extra copying levies from producers and importers and operators  of  devices
such as PCs used to manufacture copies of  such  materials.  This  leads  to
high administrative costs and over compensation of rights  holders,  and  at
the  same  time  puts  high  cost   on   cultural   institutions,   schools,
universities and children day care institutions.

Any specific compensation or restrictions on the legal uses of material and

schools, universities and children day care institutions should be
abandoned.

In most cases theses materials are developed and created in public
universities and similar educational institutions, with state and public
financial support, incl. EU. In addition, rights holders of such material
participate in the "regular" compensation schemes and by that are
sufficiently compensated for educational and teaching uses.

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain





The legal situation is unclear and in-transparent, due to the very complex
rules for scientific exceptions. This leads to uncertainty in the
scientific community and heavily hinders research, scientific work and
teaching at universities and other educational institutions; pls. also see
question 42. Overall this amounts to server restrictions to innovation and
education.


At the same time, these exceptions (albeit ineffective) are used by
collecting societies such as VG Wort to negate the applicability of court
rulings from the ECJ such as the "Padawan"-decision on German law, as
allegedly this decision was on Spanish copyright, which (then) had no such
exceptions.


According to § 52a, § 52b and § 53 sec. 2 to sec. 7 of the German Copyright
Code these exceptions read as follows:





§ 52a Making works available to the public for instruction and research


(1) It shall be permissible for:


1.  published small, limited parts of a work, small scale works, as well as
individual articles from newspapers or periodicals for illustration in
teaching at schools, universities, non-commercial institutions of education
and further education, and at vocational training institutions, exclusively
for the specifically limited circle of those taking part in the
instruction, or


2.  published limited parts of a work, small scale works, as well as
individual articles from newspapers or periodicals exclusively for a
specifically limited circle of persons for their personal scientific
research


to be made available to the public, to the extent that this is necessary
for the respective purpose and is justified for the pursuit of non-
commercial aims..


(2) Making a work intended for use in instruction in schools available to
the public shall in all cases be permissible only with the consent of the
copyright owner. Making a cinematographic work available to the public, in
the territory to which this Act applies, before the expiration of two years
from the beginning of normal regular utilisation in film theatres, shall in
all cases be permissible only with the consent of the rightholder.


(3) It shall be permissible, in the cases referred to in paragraph (1), to
produce copies also needed for making the work available to the public.


(4) An equitable remuneration shall be paid for making works available to
the public in accordance with paragraph (1). Claims may only be asserted
through a collecting society.





§ 52b Communication of works at terminals in public libraries, museums and
archives


So far as there are no contractual provisions to the contrary, it shall be
permissible to make published works available from the stocks of publicly
accessible libraries, museums or archives, which neither directly nor
indirectly serve economic or commercial purposes, exclusively on the
premises of the relevant institution at terminals dedicated to the purpose
of research and for private study. In principle, reproduction of a work in
excess of the number stocked by the institution shall not be made
simultaneously available at such terminals. Equitable remuneration shall be
paid in consideration of their being made available. The claim may only be
asserted by a collecting society.





§ 53 Reproduction for private and other personal uses


(1)…


(2) It shall be permissible to make single copies of a work or to have
these made


1.  for one's own scientific use if and to the extent that such
reproduction is necessary for the purpose and it does not serve a
commercial purpose,


2.  for inclusion in a personal archive if and insofar as the reproduction
is necessary for this purpose and one's own personal copy of the work is
used as the model from which the copy is made,


3.  for one's own personal information concerning current affairs if the
work was broadcasted,


4.  for other personal use


a)  in the case of small parts of a released work or individual articles
being released in newspapers or periodicals,


b) in the case of a work which has been out of print for at least two
years.


This shall apply in the case under the first sentence, number 2 only if in
addition,


1.  the reproduction is effected on paper or any similar medium by the use
of any kind of photographic technique or by some other process having
similar effects, or


2.  exclusively analogue use takes place, or


3.  the archive acting in the public interest and pursues no direct or
indirect economic or commercial purpose.


This shall apply in the cases referred to under the first sentence, numbers
3 and 4 only if in addition one of the conditions under the second
sentence, numbers 1 or 2 pertains.


(3) It shall be permissible to make copies for personal use of small parts
of a work, of small-scale works or of individual articles released in
newspapers or periodicals or made available to the public


1.  for the purpose of illustration for teaching in schools, in non-
commercial training and further training institutions, as well as
vocational training institutions in quantities required for the persons
receiving instruction, or


2.  for state examinations and examinations in schools, higher education
institutions, non-commercial training and further training institutions, as
well as vocational training institutions in the required quantity,


or to have these copies made if and insofar as reproduction is necessary
for this purpose. The reproduction of a work intended for instructional use
at schools shall be permissible only in cases where the person entitled has
given his consent.


(4) The reproduction of


a)  graphic recordings of musical works,


b)  a book or a periodical, in the case of an essentially complete
reproduction,


shall, insofar as this does not occur by means of manual transcription,
always be permissible only with the consent of the rightholder or under the
conditions in accordance with paragraph (2), first sentence, item 2, or for
personal use if, the work has been out of print for at least two years.


(5) Paragraph (1), paragraph (2), first sentence, items 2 to 4, as well as
paragraph (3), item 2, shall not apply to database works the elements of
which are individually accessible by electronic means. Paragraph (2), first
sentence, item 1, as well as paragraph (3), item 1, shall apply to such
database works on condition that the scientific use or use in instruction
does not serve commercial purposes.


(6) The copies may neither be distributed nor communicated to the public.
It shall, however, be permissible to lend lawfully produced copies of
newspapers and out-of-print works, as well as those works in which no
damaged or missing parts have been replaced by means of copies.


(7) The recording of public lectures, productions or performances of a work
on video or audio recording mediums, the realisation of plans and drafts of
artistic works and the reconstruction of architectural works shall always
be permissible only with the consent of the rightholder.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or

in special formats, including across borders?

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

In Germany well known examples are so called mash-ups of pre-existing  works
of art, sampling of music, and literary and  artistic  parodies.  These  are
all art forms by themselves, innovative, and as such valuable and useful  to
society and economy.


However, under the strict and prohibitive  German  Copyright  regime,  these
art forms and forms of artistic  expression  are  oftentimes  "illegal"  and
overall it exists a far reaching and severe legal uncertainty in this area.

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain





1.
As of today there are dramatic differences between EU states in the
methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and
allocating beneficiaries of the levy. According to extensive empirical
research by Prof. Martin Kretschmer (Professor of Information
Jurisprudence, Director of the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy &
Management, www.cippm.org.uk, Bournemouth University) for the UK
Intellectual Property Office in 2011 there were levies on blank media in 22
EU countries, on MP3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries,
on personal computers in 4 countries. Some EU states do not impose copying
levies at all, in others, especially in Germany, the collecting societies
impose levies on a large number of different devices and media, with very
high amounts in each case (e.g. more than 18,- EUR per PC and 36,- EUR per
smartphone). These variations among EU states cannot be explained by an
underlying concept of economic harm or fair compensation to rightholders
for private copying.


In addition, in most EU states there is a high degree of legal uncertainty
to whether certain "modern" devices such as PCs, Tablets and Smartphones
are leviable at all, and if so, to what degree/what amount. After decades
of proceedings this legal uncertainty is not yet resolved by the courts,
including the Germany Supreme Court BGH and the ECJ.


Under the current German levy system, and in spite of the fact, that this
legal system has been established in the 1960's already, and has been
discussed between stakeholders ever since then, it is yet unknown whether
producers and importers of PCs, Tablets and Mobile Phones do have to pay a
copyright levy at all, and if so, on which kind of devices (for PCs in
private use only, or for so called Business PCs as well). Expert discussion
and negotiates between ICT interest groups such as BITKOM e.V. and ZItCo
e.V., and Collection Societies went on for years, and are stalled by now.
Court decisions, just recently by the ECJ ("Padawan", "Opus") as well as
the German Supreme Court (Bundesgerichthof BGH, U.v. 230.11.2011, Az. I ZR
59/10) lead to further confusion in stating, that Consumer and Business PC
cannot be subject to a common levy ("Padawan"), and that in general PCs are
not a homogenous group of devices that can be subjected to a general PC
levy, other like e.g. telefax machines (BGH).


Some more German examples: there is still a still a litigation pending on
copyright levy claims for PCs and printers in Germany for the years 2001
onwards, i.e. 13 years after those devices have been sold; as of today, no
court, not even a court of first instance, has rendered a judgement on
copyright levies for mobile phones for the years 2004 onwards, i.e. ten
years after their sale; for the first time in 2010 the German Collecting
Societies issued a tariff for PCs, claiming levies thereon of 17,xx EUR
retroactively backward to 1.1.2008; as of today, there is no final and
binding court decision on whether PCs are leviable at all, although the
Collecting Societies have sued many companies around 2005.


In Austria, the Supreme Court found 2005 that no levy shall be applied on
PCs and internal hard drives (Austrian Supreme Court, judgment of
12.07.2005, 4 Ob 115/05y - Gericom), but now, almost 9 years later, decided
to the contrary (Austrian Supreme Court,  judgment of 17.12.2013, 4 Ob
138/13t)


The Spanish government just recently has abolished its whole levy system,
after it was found illegal in the light of the Padawan-decision of the ECJ.



In France, the French upper administrative court issued a judgment stating
that the tariffs are illegal, but still obliged the manufacturers to pay a
levy for an interim period (French Conseil d'Etat, decisions of 17.06.2011
N°324816, 325439, 325463, 325468 and 325469).


In Italy currently imaging products and PCs are not subject to levies, but
levies might be extended to external hard disks, mobile phones with MP3
capabilities, and possibly PCs.


In the Netherlands the rate and scope of levies were frozen, as the Dutch
Government has indicated that the levy system needs to be reviewed and
corrected before expansion.





Further uncertainty stems from the general concept of the German law (since
1.1.2008), under which the producers, importers and vendors of technical
devices have to determine by themselves, whether a device in their
portfolio is subject to such a levy. This determination shall be based on
the very general and vague criterium, whether such device is "actually
used" by end users (consumers and other) to make so called private copies.
Especially SMEs without "top notch" legal representation lack the necessary
legal knowledge, as well as the empirical data required to determine,
whether such use takes place.


Due to complete legal uncertainty about the levies under the current system
-- whether levies have to be paid for PCs and other devices at all, for
what sub-groups of such devices, and what specific amount in each case --
makes it impossible for companies, that produce or import such devices
(such as ZitCo's members), to act in conformity with the legal requirements
and cause them high cost for legal consultation and representation. Also
they encounter severe disadvantages in national competition as well as in
cross-border transactions within the European market; the levies and
payments requested by the German collecting societies reach back many years
(back to the year 2002) and sum up to amounts, which will cause mass
insolvencies among SMEs if successfully enforced.





2.
This obvious and wide spread legal uncertainty can only be resolved on the
EU level.


However, first it should be noted, that it is questionable if any kind of
compensation for copyright exceptions is legally required and economically
useful at all. For that pls. see question 71 below.


Coherence in tariff setting for copying levies can only be achieved if
levies are determined equally on the European level through an independent
European agency/institution. This is an administrative task, requiring
statistical data and economic competence. We therefor believe that a
European agency should determine the devices that are subject to copyright
levies and the levies' amounts.


Experience shows, that even though already today the legal framework for
the determination of copying levies are largely unified by European
directives (eg. EU Copyright Directive of 2001), national legislators and
collecting societies nevertheless come up with systematically and in their
effects heavily differing levy schemes for their respective countries,
leading to extremely different levy burdens between countries.





3.
Also, national Colleting Societies -- especially in Germany -- use the
legal uncertainty with regard to almost all aspects of copying levies on
"modern" devices such as PCs, Tablets and Mobile Phones and their power as
monopolistic, state close entities of considerable size aggressively, to
press producers and importers of such devices, especially SMEs with small
"legal" budgets, for high and quite obviously illegal levy payments.
Especially, even today they have sued many companies for levy payments
without making any distinction between devices used by business, public
agencies and educational institutions, and devices used by private
consumers, albeit this is openly illegal and against the "Padawan"-ruling
by the ECJ.


Whenever complaints against this fraudulent behaviour are brought to
supervising authorities over the German Collecting Societies, such as the
DPMA (Patent and Trademark Agency) or the Antitrust Commission, it is to no
prevail. The is no effective supervision over the German Collecting
Societies.


Effective supervision can only be established on an EU level, as
traditionally, in Germany the ties between the Collecting Societies and the
supervision authorities are very close and do not allow for effective
supervision; at the same time, only through supervision on the EU level a
common approach to levies and their enforcement can be assured.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[59]

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain





Obviously, any such allowed/licensed "private copy" has been priced in into
the service's fees. Also, such copy has been licensed by the rightholders
(in allowing the service to offer such service), so that there is no harm
or damage to the rightholders that calls for compensation. Technical
development allows rightholders to protect their works and to define, and
charge for, any use, they allow/license to services and users. Literally,
it is their business, to make use of theses measures to secure income from
their work.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


Any extension of the current levy systems to cover cloud services is not
legally possible under the current legal regime, which asks for
compensation for private copies of works. With cloud services, no such
copies are made, but the one copy of a work that "sits" in the cloud is
made available through streaming to different devices of the respective
consumer; if users use cloud services to store e.g. their music, there are
no (further) copies (pls. note that question 66 implies otherwise, which is
false). I.e. any extension of levies on such service would basically be a
tariff on a service that allows a user to access his music (his one copy of
his music) from different places and with different devices / streaming
clients.


Current levy systems based on absolute numbers of private copies are
affected by current technological development. It is to be expected that in
the (near) future, absolute numbers of private copies will heavily
decrease, as users store their content (music, books, videos and other)
increasingly in the "cloud" (Internet), with services such as Google Drive,
Apple's iCloud, Drop Box etc. and then only stream such content to mobile
and other devices for consumption. Ultimately, this technological
development will diminish private copying, and levies imposed thereon.


Other current technological developments such as improved DRM (digital
rights management) already give right holders full control over their
content, even on the internet. Today it is easily and at no cost possible,
to exclude any kind of content and whole web pages from services such as
Google search and Google picture search, to effectively protect it from
being downloaded or copied, and from being distributed, etc. However,
oftentimes right holders chose to make parts of their works publicly
available for free (even under a creative commons license etc.), for
example for marketing reasons. It cannot be justified to request copyright
levies on works released under such conditions for free and without any
protection.





That said, the emergence and the further spread of cloud services and
network services (such as NAS-drives) will inevitable lead to a reduction
in the total amount collected from copying levies, as the number and the
capacities of such media and devices will diminish. However, this is only a
counter reaction to the trend of today (at least in Germany) to charge ever
higher levies on ever more devices, only because it is technically possible
to make more copies of protected works with todays technology. This
argument ignores the fact, that the use and consumption of media and
protected content/works did not increase, as users do not have higher time
budgets for such use, then they did have in the past. Therefore the use of
protected works has not increased because of technological advancements.

Obviously this would add transparency for the consumer and EU citizen about
who asks for his money, and why.


Also it would increase legal certainty in situations, where levies need to

times).

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and

continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

ZItCo's members -- SMEs producing and importing IT hardware such as
Computers, Tablets and Mobile Phones -- compete for customers and market
share in an extremely price sensitive market, dominated by a handful of
huge, multinational US and Asia based companies such as HP, Dell, Apple,
Acer, and Asus, who use synergies and their economies of scale to drive
smaller, less powerful competitors out off the market. Basically speaking,
the products in question -- PCs, hardware components, Mobile Phones,
Tablets -- are commodities and buyers (consumers, companies, administrative
entities etc.) have very high degree of price transparency and market
overview due to increasing internet sales/ecommerce, price comparison tools
and public invitations to tender. Therefore, the market is highly
competitive and price sensitive.


In such a market environment, the very different level of copyright levies
in the EU countries -- from none in UK, Cyprus, currently Spain, and
others, to many very high levies e.g. in Germany -- disrupts the
competition between companies from different EU countries and therefore
heavily affects the Single Market. As the level of copyright levies --
number of different device groups levied at all, amount of such levies in
each single case -- is highest in Germany by far, ZItCo's members
experience heavy disadvantages in the market place compared to similar
companies from other EU countries.


In addition, the administrative costs going along with copyright levies,
are by far the highest within EU, and adversely affect the efficiency of
the single market.


As an example it might be noted, that "blank" BluRay Disks are not sold by
any company in/from Germany, as the German Collecting Societies claim a
copying levy of EUR 3,473 per piece thereon, with no distinction whether
the discs are used in business (mostly for backups), or at home
(insignificant numbers/percentages). At the same time EU states like
Luxemburg and the UK do not claim any copying levies, neither on devices,
nor on blank media. This discrepancy resulted in the advent on specialized
online vendors for blank media products as well as devices like mp3
players, mobile phones, portable computers, tablets etc. -- commodities,
that can be easily send per mail/express -- who take their administrative
place of business in Luxemburg (e.g. Amazon, running "amazon.de") or the UK
and from there the whole European market. Obviously, such companies have
significant (and unfair) cost advantages over competitors who sit in
Germany.

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]



From our observations and empirical data from about 100 SMEs producing and
importing IT hardware such as Computers, Tablets and Mobile Phones about
80% to 90% of all of theses products are sold to enterprises, small
businesses, business professionals, state agencies, university, schools and
other similar organizations, which use these (and other IT products such as
scanners and printers) for their own professional, educational, scientific
and business uses; theses devices are not used for private copying. The
remaining about 20% are finally sold to private users/consumers.

Currently, an even after the "Padawan" decision of the ECJ, German
colleting societies ask for the "full" copying levies (100%) also for these
devises and media, and have sued many SME companies accordingly; theses
court proceeding go on since many years already and there are no definite
court decision yet, banning this obviously illegal behaviour.

Whenever the collecting societies succeed with their requests, mostly
against small and "weak" entities and companies and just recently due to
trade agreement with an interest group of multi national PC producers
headed by Hewlett-Packard and Dell, this results in heavy (and illegal)
overcompensation for the respective rightholders.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]



100% of the specific trades are affected.

In Germany, up to today no a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement
schemes exist / are in force.

Just a few days ago, the German Collecting societies retroactively
published a new levy tariff for PCs for the years 2011 to 2016 that for the
first time includes a priori distinction between "Consumer PCs" and
"Business PCs", and asking for a lower levy of 4,- EUR for every "Business
PC" (compared to 13,xx EUR for a "Consumer PC"). However, the way this
distinction is drawn is highly impractical, very complicated and
discriminates against small and medium sized companies producing or
importing such devices.

This Tariff can be found here:
https://www.zpue.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Tarif_PCs_ab_2011.pdf

Its is a document of 28 (!) pages; about  21 pages deal with the question
of how to draw a distinction between PCs used by businesses and educational
institutions, and PCs used by private users/consumers. This already shows,
how complicated and complex this issue is. From our experience it can be
said, that in praxi its in nearly impossible to administer this
distinction, and that the administrative costs that come with this tariff
are prohibitively for SME companies.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]




The current copyright levy regime in Germany and the EU is a mix of tariffs
randomly applied to different devices and blank media, at different levels,
in different ways within different countries of the EU. In countries such
as Germany, with an exceptional high number and degree of levies, this
results in unfair, uneven and un-proportionate burdens especially on SMEs,
who cannot flee the country and conduct cross border business from outside
the country. At the same time the current system hinders timely and just
payments to rights holders.

Overall the current situation in Germany is marked by claims made by the
collecting societies that would lead to heavy over-compensation of
copyright holders; this is shown by expert opinions e.g. of Prof. Dr.
Tobias Kretschmer of University of Munich and ifo-institute.

The laws and court decision by lower courts as well as by the German
Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice are unclear, inconsistent
and conflicting, leading to a situation of widespread legal uncertainty.
There has been a rash of court cases in Germany and other EU countries;
many proceedings still go on and will not be finally decided until up 5 to
10 years from now.

For end users, there is no transparency at all about copyright levies,
their amounts, and their justification; they are not informed about these
levies at all.



These problems can be solved only as follows:



1.
First it should be noted that it is questionable if any kind of
compensation for copyright exceptions is legally required and economically
useful at all.

In many EU states, incl. large markets like the UK and Spain, no such
compensation regime exists; this includes EU states, that have exceptions
to copyrights such as the private copying exception. The underlying believe
is that markets regulate compensation and should not be affected /
regulated in doing so. A copy of a protected work that comes with certain
rights such as the right to privately copy the work, will automatically
score a higher market price, as it constitutes a "better" and more valuable
product for the consumer (buyer). In accordance with this, studies have
found that media works such as Films and Music, that come with restrictive
DRM and thus technically prevent being copied, trade at lower prices then
the same and comparable works without such DRM limitations.

Also, any compensation scheme imposed by the legislator will come at a
significant administrative cost, that will lead to a lesser demand for the
work/product due to its higher price to the consumer. At the same time this
will reduce payments to rightsholders.

Finally, its has to be considered, that when levies were introduced in the
1960’s on analogous audio and video recorders and magnetic tapes, there was
the assumption that nearly every audio and video recorder used the product
for private copying. This private copying assumption for analogue hardware
does not hold true in todays technological -- digital -- environment. PCs,
Tablets, Mobile Phones are multifunctional devices that are used for
various purposes, most of which are irrelevant for levies.



This all calls for the complete abolition of any system of copying levies,
which is recommended by many experts because of its positive effects on
efficiency and cost, and the free trade within the single market, which is
to the benefit of authors and rights holders a s well. At the same time,
this has almost no negative effects on the authors and rightsholders. E.g.
Prof. Martin Kretschmer (Professor of Information Jurisprudence, Director
of the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy & Management,
www.cippm.org.uk, Bournemouth University), who has conducted extensive
empirical research and analysis for the UK Intellectual Property Office in
2011, is therefor strongly promoting this scenario; pls see
http://www.cippm.org.uk/alcs_study.html



2.
However, if, for policy reasons, a legislative compensation scheme is
considered to be necessary, such scheme has to be transparent and cost
effective. Also, it has to be neutral to the Single Market and competition
within the Single Market. To address issues of transparency, administrative
cost and negative effects on competition and the Single Market, ZItCo has
already suggested a complete overhaul and renewal of copyright levies
system on the EU level.

ZItCo suggests to introduce an European Agency, that decides on the overall
amount of levies to be paid out to copyright holders, based on statistical
data from Eurostat on the numbers of PCs, printers, and other devices used
for private copying, and their (estimated) actual usage for such copying.
From this data the agency should calculate a fair and economically
reasonable total amount to be paid out to rights holders as compensation
for their losses of direct licensing fees.

The allocation of the amount to be collected to the rights holders of each
country would basically be determined by the amounts collected in each
country; however, adjustments could be considered to take into account
differences in the respective economies etc.

The allocation of the levies to the different groups of rights holders
(music composers, authors, etc.) and their respective collecting societies
in each country could be done through the traditional system of national
collecting societies.

Also, the national collection societies (or preferably one national agency
acting for all collecting societies of a country) would be responsible for
the collection of the levies from the debtors in their respective country.

Debtors of the levies should be the users/end customers of devices subject
to the levies, i.e. the private consumers using such devices and therefore
profiting from private copying. However, for practical reasons the levies
would be collected not from individuals, but from the (registered)
households. Such generalization is necessary, and justified on the
assumption, that as of today each household within the EU owns a PC and/or
other copying devices and media and profits from private copying.

For reasons of fairness and transparency, as well as market and competition
neutrality, and to reduce administrative and transaction costs, copying
levies should be directly collected from the end users (private consumers)
only, who (only) profit from private copying and cause "harm" to
rightsholders. For practical reasons, generalizations are necessary,
calling for a per household fee ("Haushaltsabgabe").

We expect the system suggested here to be fair, practical and cost
efficient. A similar system has recently been introduced in Germany to
collect the fees for public service TV and radio (so called
"Haushaltsabgabe" / per-houshold-fee). As of today, such system is
suggested for Austria as well (see http://www.modernes-urheberrecht.at/).
It would drastically increase legal certainty, it would avoid all market
and competition disturbances of the single EU market, and it would lead to
a just and equal debit of (only) those users, who actually profit from
private copying; at the same time it would provide full transparency and
ensure speedy pay outs to rightsholders.

A levy system as outlined would not negatively affect cross border
transactions and sales and would not require any special adjustments.
However, a levy system based on national legislation will always face
double levies, costly reimbursement procedures, and ineffective enforcement
of cross border payments ("Opus" decision of the European Court of
Justice).





3.
German Colleting Societies use the legal uncertainty with regard to almost
all aspects of copying levies on "modern" devices such as PCs, Tablets and
Mobile Phones (see above, Question …), and their power as monopolistic,
state close entities of considerable size aggressively, to press producers
and importers of such devices, especially SMEs with small "legal" budgets,
for high and quite obviously illegal levy payments. Especially, even today
they have sued many companies for levy payments without making any
distinction between devices used by business, public agencies and
educational institutions, and devices used by private consumers, albeit
this is openly illegal and against the "Padawan"-ruling by the ECJ.


Whenever complaints against this fraudulent behaviour are brought to
supervising authorities over the German Collecting Societies, such as the
DPMA (Patent and Trademark Agency) or the Antitrust Commission, it is to no
prevail. There is no effective supervision over the German Collecting
Societies.


Effective supervision can only be established on an EU level, as
traditionally, in Germany the ties between the Collecting Societies and the
supervision authorities are very close and do not allow for effective
supervision; at the same time, only through supervision on the EU level a
common approach to levies and their enforcement can be assured.

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

The German rules in §§ 32, 32a UrhG (Copyright Code) are a good first step
to ensure such adequate compensation, especially to allow authors to claim
such compensation directly from intermediaries such as publishing houses or
TV stations, who oftentimes are not their contract partners. However,
authors who do so, oftentimes get openly "blacklisted", loosing all
opportunity to work (and earn a living) in their respective trades (as an
author etc.). Thus, theses rules need to be clarified even more, and should
be encompassed by mechanisms, which allow Interest Groups of Authors etc.
to claim adequate compensation by themselves for such authors and without
having to name / identify individual authors.

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


In Germany, enforcement against illegal uses is already very effective, and
the system is widely abused by lawyers of the mass rightsholders in the
Music- and Film-industry to basically blackmail private users/consumers
(including children).

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

Yes, it is. As a result intermediaries like Amazon, Google and eBay have
established effective notice & take down mechanisms.

  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


See above. In Germany widespread abuse is common, having caused the
parliament to recently enact a law named  "law against dishonest business
practices" (!) to put some restriction on this abuse by the Music and Film
industry, and their lawyers.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

Yes

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[10] Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council
of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[18] Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[31] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

[40] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.
