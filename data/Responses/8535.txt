              A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
              Europe

              of the market through licensing agreements

               1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access online

                  decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
                  protection) Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned
                  (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
                  maga ines, ournals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

               asked to grant multi-territorial licences Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and
               provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

               way to tackle them


                 There are already solutions provided by rightsholders. Collective Managment Organisations and other licensing
                 agents work well and help to protect against illegal use.




                 . [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why,
               even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find
               it necessary or ustified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
               ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)

                    would improve content availability and provide protection for rightsholders.

                     Not all cache memory copies may be temporary and/or incidental - this is too simplistic an assumption.

                     Reproductions temporary and incidental to an authorised act should not require additional consent,

               Show introduction


               1 . What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in
               promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases


                 The EU should follow the U and develop an EU Copyright Hub, or a simple extension to the U Hub itself.

                 The EU should encourage adoption of appropriate standards, perhaps as an enabler for their development and
                 adoption.
