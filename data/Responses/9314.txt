-        “UBVA” stands for The Council for Protection of Scientific Works.

We are the Danish Council for organization of academics. UBVA handles
academics interests in relation to intellectual property, i.e. primarily
copyright, patent law and design rights. In practice, we work primarily
with copyright and have since 1943 offered services to the member
organizations.

UBVA is a part of The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations
(“Akademikerne”) which is an umbrella organization for its 25 member
organizations, with a total of 320.000 members. These organizations offer
services to professional and managerial staff graduated from universities
and other higher educational institutions.



                I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

1.               [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to
access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
         - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned
(e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)



                                                                                                                   2
x   NO OPINION




2.              [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide
online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other issues
(e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such
as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general,
music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).


x   NO OPINION


3.        [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you
asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and
provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]



-      None.


4.         If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the
best way to tackle them?
[Open question]




5.              [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you
would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for
instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
x   YES – Please explain by giving examples




-      It is often expensive to set up a commercial platform in other
       countries and to secure proper surveillance to avoid copyright
       infringements.


6.              [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even
in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still
find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to
redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples


                                                                                                                   3
x   NO OPINION


7.              Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single
Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
       – Please explain
x   NO – Please explain




-      What should be remembered is that copyright actually gives
      solutions to a number of problems that would otherwise be left to law
      of contracts, which is exactly the case in relation to sports rights.
      Removing the possibility of territorially restricting copyright licenses
      might not have the intended effect, but may instead lead to more
      complex contractual regulation which could limit the access to cultural
      content from other European countries.



8.             Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


x NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g.
as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)




-     The question is best answered through case law in the EU Court of
      Justice which will tale into regard specificities of different situations
      which is not suitable for legislative solution.
      The scope of “making available” online is much wider and much more
      diverse, and does not fit with why “country of origin” has worked for
      satellite transmission. With satellite there is a system in place in case
      of for instance cable retransmission. Online, significant question
      regarding linking and other forms of reuse remain.


9.             [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the
“making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to
be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
       – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


x   NO OPINION



                                                                                                             4
10.              [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to
a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
         – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g.
facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


x   NO OPINION



11.            Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

why
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and
why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it
should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.             Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer,
either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

x   NO OPINION



14.             [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences

x     YES – Please explain
        – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter




      II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.            Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the
EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
         – Please explain by referring to specific cases
x     NO – Please explain




-        Copyright is not only about protecting the creative forces, but also to
         ensure that users can access creative content in a balanced manner,
         taking into account those who have created it. This goal is often
         achieved best by creating an optimal framework for agreements
         between users and rights holders.

         In Denmark, we have good experience with the conclusion of such
         agreements. Here, authors and publisher and producers enter into

                                                                                                                6
      agreements on the use of digital cultural heritage material with
      culture heritage institutions; this provides a broader and more flexible
      access to use protected material than they could have achieved by an
      exception in the law. Libraries, educational institutions, television
      distributors etc. have important agreements with collecting societies.

      These agreements ensure that authors and other rights holders
      receive payment for the use of the creative content they have
      created. Payment to authors, like the academics represented by
      UBVA, contributes to their revenue stream so that they can
      concentrate on writing etc.

      Copyright protection and remuneration to the authors is, therefore,
      also an important tool in order to promote scientific research and
      education at a high level.


22.            Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
       – Please explain by referring to specific cases
x   NO – Please explain




-     Exceptions, in a broad view, damage the cultural production as
      content creator’s loose encouragement to create new works.
      Exceptions to copyright should only be applied as a measure of last
      resort and licensing should be the preferred solution. In different
      member states different levels of licensing tools and solutions exist.
      We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing
      solutions though positive and constructive initiatives such as licensing
      for Europe. Creating mandatory exceptions on the other hand, would
      damage existing licensing models and thus damage the creation of
      jobs in the creative sector. It is the experience of UBVA that the users
      prefer flexibility through licensing in stead of having to rely on
      exceptions and limitations to the exclusive right of authors.


23.            Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



24.   Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in
the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

                                                                                                             7
         – Please explain why
x     NO – Please explain why




-       Licensing is much more flexible than limitations and exceptions. A
        broad exception or limitation will not be a real assistance for anybody
        in the copyright field.


25.                If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (E.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in
flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating
what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on
the functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]


-       A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even
        in the USA, where common law is used, significant uncertainties still
        prevail, especially regarding new forms of use, even with decades of
        judgments concerning fair use. Periodic revision would be a problem
        as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived balance of
        thousands and thousands of contract concerning rights.

        Broad wording creates legal uncertainty.

        UBVA believes that specific exceptions combined with flexible
        licensing solutions will meet the demands of users, rightsholders and
        the market better than a general fair use exception.


26.               Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
         – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
        – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
x     NO OPINION


27.             In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part
of the exception? (E.g. who pays whom, where?)

31.               If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]



-       Licensing, both individual and collective licensing provides a more
        flexible solution to both users and rightsholders. That was also a
        conclusion in the Commission’s Licences for Europe project.


32.             (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including
across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to
consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such
as universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that
enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-
matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
[Open question]



-       Collections in national institutes are often in the national language.
        Therefore there is no significant demand for access to Danish
        collections from other countries. In Denmark, there are numerous
        agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and archives. The
        budget of these are often linked to public service obligations – which
        are limited to the relevant member state, and their funding therefor
        does not allow for entering into cross-border licenses.
        The general ECL provision in the Danish Copyright Act can be used as
        the legal foundation for a collective agreement. It is mentioned in the

                                                                                                             9
        explanatory notes to Section 50(2) that the provision can be applied
        when the cultural heritage is to be digitized.

33.               If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]



-       The orphan works directive is being implemented in member states,
        and relevant stakeholders have agreed upon key principles on
        digitizing and making available of out-of-commerce works in 2011
        MoU. There should be a follow up on the legal basis of the cross
        border availability as regards the 2011 MoU which would create more
        legal certainty and facilitate licensing.

40.              [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your
country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between
libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed
across the EU?
        – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
x   NO – Please explain




-      With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing
       the general ECL provision (sec. 50(2)), users such as libraries and
       collecting societies were enabled to enter into mass digitization
       projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help facilitate
       digitizing the Danish cultural heritages and mass digitization projects
       which include orphan works.
       The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works
       in Denmark. Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because
       the extended collective licensing (ECL) only applies within the Danish
       territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it would
       require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights
       management issued in one member state to be recognized in other
       member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11 that
       they are “calling on the European Commission, to the extent required
       to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the
       type of legislation to be enacted ….”
       In Denmark the legislation is in place, but whether or not national
       legislation is required can only be answered when the EC introduces a
       solution in relation to the 2011 MoU.


                                                                                                           11

-       In Denmark, the system of ECL licensing agreements with schools,
        universities etc. functions very well to the benefit for both
        rightsholders and educational institutions. Licensing means flexibility
        and avoidance of uncertainty regarding the understanding of an
        exception limited to “illustration” for educational purposes.


43.             If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]



-       In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight
        forward access to content, while ensuring the rightsholders are
        remunerated for the exploitation of their works.
        There are licenses for numerous uses of audiovisual material in
        teaching, through the extended collective license (ECL) and individual
        mandates in Denmark. This includes the recording and streaming of
        TV and film in schools, by teachers and students. This also covers the
        use of large amounts of European content, which exceeds the actual
        demand, why cross-border access is not a pressing issue for schools.




                                                                                                            12
44.            What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for
teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]



-     In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing (ECL). Because
      ECL based licenses include all works of all artists of a defined type it
      can provide the broadest possible access to use of content and a high
      level of legal security for the users. At the same time it provides
      rightsholders with fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works
      and support that content creators are able and encouraged to
      continue creating new works. The system is accepted by both
      educational institutions and rightsholders and has been for many
      years, which is the best testimony of its success.
      The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables
      Copydan to clear the rights for a lot of different uses in schools, but
      as mentioned individual mandate agreements are also used. The
      agreements are very successful, and the main licenses cover almost
      100 % of all schools in Denmark.
      Copydan in general collects annually millions of euro in remuneration
      to Danish and foreign rights holder for use of protected subject-
      matter in educational institutions. Hence, these funds are important
      for the possibility of producing and distributing new creative content
      to the benefit of the educational system. Specifically for the authors
      represented by UBVA these funds are essential; the collective
      management fee are very often key for the possibility of an author to
      continue to write which, eventually, also benefits the schools; without
      new creative content of high quality the students will get a poorer
      education.
      The copyright remuneration from Copydan Writing is extremely
      important for UBVA’s members as a supplement to other fees,
      salaries etc.

           IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


72.           [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of
mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and
performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


-      UBVA believes that EU law should introduce a general provision,
       similar to the one in German legislation, to secure that authors
       receive a fair remuneration when they transfer rights to producers,
       publishers, TV stations etc.
                                                                                                             18
        The present silence in EU legislation makes it difficult for authors to
        achieve fair remuneration in negotiations with the counter parties.

        EU law should also encourage general agreements between unions
        and trade organizations regarding, inter alia, clauses on transfer of
        copyright and remuneration in order to achieve a well-functioning
        market.

        Also mediation – as envisaged i Recital 46 of the Infosoc Directive –
        and other forms of dispute settlement should be regulated at
        European level.


73.               Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?
x     YES – Please explain
        – Please explain why




-       Yes, see answer to Q72.


74.            If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the
shortcomings you identify?

-       Yes, see answer to Q72.



      V. Respect for rights
75.           Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of
copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
    YES – Please explain
        – Please explain




-       Especially on the Internet it is often very complicated and expensive
        to enforce the copyright. It is quite easy for infringer to evade
        enforcement which is detrimental to the effective protection of the
        authors,




                                                                                                                    19
76.             In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement
of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain
name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

77.             Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved

                VI.            A single EU Copyright Title

78.             Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single
framework for enforcement?


x   NO




A Single European Copyright Title is not necessary and it would be against cultural diversity as national
copyright regulation and administration is also a part of national cultural policy law.


79.             Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level
of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
