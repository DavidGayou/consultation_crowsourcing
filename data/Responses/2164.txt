     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).



9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  7
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
   YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
applications and other software)
It is not possible to access broadcasts (both recorded and real time) in any country outside of
the UK because of licensing and broadcast restrictions. This is particularly detrimental to
students who are taking UK university courses at partner institutions overseas in the EU
because they are not permitted access to the same resources via a secure electronic network.
Licence fees increase but the provision of services does not improve, and this hinders the
breadth of teaching and learning resources to which students based at partner institutions have
access.


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
     NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
 An exception or limitation permitting both the recording of broadcasts and the
communication of those broadcasts via secure networks for educational purposes, with the
caveat that contract terms and technical protection measures cannot override these exceptions.
The licensing body for educational broadcasts in the UK cannot provide a licence for the
making available of broadcasts via a secure network to the rest of the EU because other

a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

Member States do not have a provision in their national laws which permits the recording of
broadcasts for educational purposes. This must be addressed in EU legislation. See also
response to Q23.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
     NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
     NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
Territoriality in licensing is a barrier to cross-border availability of content and services. For a
Single Market to be able to function in the digital realm, any measures or regulations which
unnecessarily complicate the use of content and services via the Internet should be
investigated and simplified.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.




16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.

                                                                                                            9
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would
be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)


19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                               10
The “country of origin” approach should apply with regard to copyright exceptions so that
users and service providers do not have to understand other EU countries’ copyright laws to
be able to use and provide content and services. A principled and technology neutral
definition of "making available" is needed and EU copyright exceptions should be
implemented as a mandatory minimum norm in all Member States.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     NO OPINION


2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different

rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
     NO OPINION


3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)
This question has been recently addressed by the Court of Justice in case C-466/12 Svensson,
and is also under examination in two other pending cases: C-279/13 C More Entertainment,
and C-348/13 BestWater. In Svensson, the Court found that hyperlinks are an act of public
communication but they do not amount to infringement, unless they are addressed to a “new
public” (that is to say, at a public that was not taken into account by the copyright holders
when they authorised the initial communication to the public).
In our opinion, hyperlinking should not be subject to the authorisation of rightholders under
Article 3(1) of the Information Society Directive as it is essential for the operation of the
Internet. As explained by the European Copyright Society, “(a) Hyperlinks are not
communications because establishing a hyperlink does not amount to “transmission” of a
work, and such transmission is a pre- requisite for “communication”; (b) Even if transmission
is not necessary for there to be a “communication”, the rights of the copyright owner apply
only to communication to the public “of the work”, and whatever a hyperlink provides, it is
not “of a work”; (c) Even if a hyperlink is regarded as a communication of a work, it is not to
a “new public” (See European Copyright Society, Opinion on the Reference to the CJEU in
Case C- 466/12 Svensson, 15 February 2013, p. 2).




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright
exception)
Merely viewing copyright material online (as opposed to downloading or printing that
material) should not amount to copyright infringement. This ought to apply to acts of copying
that are mere by-products of a technical communication process, such as copies made on
internet routers or in proxy servers, web browsers, or caches.
Article 5(1) of the Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) should also cover temporary
copies generated by internet users. It has never been an infringement of copyright law to view
or read copyright content in physical form. Should mere viewing, rather than downloading or
printing, of copyright content be an infringement, millions of ordinary internet users across
the EU would be liable for infringement. The exception of temporary copying under Article
5(1) does not only cover the process of transmission in a network between third parties by an
intermediary but it also applies to “lawful use”. This covers use of copyright works, whether



                                                                                            12
or not authorised by the copyright owner, insofar as it is not restricted by legislation. The use
of the work by internet users by browsing online should be included.
This issue has been discussed in Public Relations Consultants Association Limited v The
Newspaper Licensing Agency Limited and Others ([2013] UKSC 18).


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
There are mainly legal restrictions as to the resale of “used” digital files. Even though digital
exhaustion was affirmed in Usedsoft (C-128/11) with regards to the resale of software sold
online, this was argued to be a lex specialis and hence not applicable with regards to other
copyright content. For other categories of copyright works, Article 3(3) of the Information
Society Directive (2001/29/EC) applies, which does not allow for the exhaustion of the public
communication right.
Because of this legal restriction, it is not possible for consumers to re-sell “used” digital files
without infringing copyright. It is also not possible for companies to introduce online
platforms that enable the lawful resale of digital goods, although it is technically feasible to
overcome the main normative impediments of digital exhaustion, i.e. those that have to do
with the nature of the digital copy and the nature of the transaction. Amazon Inc, for instance,
was awarded a US patent in January 2013 for a “secondary market for digital objects”,
including e-books, audio, video, computer applications purchased from an original vendor
(US Patent, no 8,364,595). Amazon’s patented system creates conditions resembling the
transfer of hard copies through personalised data stores enabling “storage of the digital object

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13
at the receiving storage location or computing device and deletion of the digital object from
the sending storage location or computing device”. It is also possible to technically restrict the
number of possible resales. Still, however, there is controversy as to the legitimacy of such
services, especially in light of the Redigi ruling in the US (Capitol Records v Redigi, No. 12
Civ. 95 (RJS)).


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
A legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would increase
legal certainty and open up new possibilities for entrepreneurship and innovation in the EU.
The Museum of English Rural Life (http://www.reading.ac.uk/merl/), for instance, as a
supplier of images for commercial use would welcome the regulation of the online resale of
images, especially in instances where images are being put into third party image banks
without authorization.
Providing a framework that enables the resale of digital content requires the revision of
Article 3(3) of the Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC). This is in compliance with
EU’s international obligations, as the WIPO Internet Treaties do not foreclose the possibility
of digital exhaustion. The signatory countries are left with the discretion to apply the principle
of exhaustion “after the first sale or other transfer of ownership of the original or a copy of the
work with the authorization of the author” (WCT, Art. 6; WPPT, Art. 8). There is nothing in
the WIPO Treaties excluding the application of the exhaustion rule in online transactions.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
Formalities (such as registration and renewal of copyright) as a requirement for protection
were abolished with the 1908 Berlin revision of the Berne Convention (Article 5.2) and were
in turn eliminated in all the signatory countries. “The elimination of formalities at
international level, however, does not mean that they are outlawed in principle. What is
banned is to condition the exercise or enjoyment of copyright upon them. Even though

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
registration is not a requirement for protection, some national laws encourage authors to
voluntarily register their rights to establish proof in case of copyright infringement. This is,
for instance, the case in Spain where works may be registered with the General Registry of
Intellectual Property with a view to prove ownership and to better identify the rightholders.
In the United States too, registration is recommended so that authors are eligible for statutory
damages and to bring action if works are of US origin, and renewal requirements have been
removed to be replaced by a new term of protection, namely life of the author plus 50 years—
and subsequently to 70 years” (Borghi and Karapapa, Copyright and mass
digitization. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013, pp. 74).
A registration system at EU level would help to better identify rightholders of works which
are protected by copyright. It is currently difficult to trace rightholders to get permission to
use works outside of the scope of the limitations and exceptions.


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
A registration system would better future-proof copyright works from becoming orphan
works. It may also help authors/creators to take action for copyright infringement as they
would be able to prove their ownership via the registration system (although that does not
protect the system against abuse by people who do not own the rights – this would need to be
considered).


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Copyright registration for all works from EU Member States would need a lot of resources,
both funding and staff knowledge and expertise. There is a question over whether the service
will be a paid-for service or free; this may depend on the commercial or non-commercial
nature of the work. The infrastructure (database) would need to be robust in order to hold
many different types of works (including audiovisual works which often come in the form of
extremely large files), and would have to have a user-friendly online interface so that end
users can find the works they are looking for. The operational practicalities would need to be
carefully considered before such a system was implemented.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
See response to Q16.

C.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such



31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       15
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such
identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated
licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
Identifiers could prove very useful in a range of contexts. ISBNs and ISSNs have been
instrumental in enabling the control of published information.

D.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.


20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Many of our current problems arise from the lengthy duration of copyright.
Our archives and special collections provide safe havens for a number of rare and unique
older works still in copyright. However, because they sometimes receive deposits of works
rather than the transfer of copyright, this can cause problems when visitors to the archive
would like to use older works outside the scope of the limitations and exceptions. Most often,
rightsholders cannot either be traced or contacted, and in some cases opening a dialogue with
the owners of copyright the can prove counter-productive, i.e. they may threaten to withdraw
the item from the archive to prevent publication.

There is evidence which suggests only a small proportion of creators benefit from the current
copyright term of 70 years after the death of the author; many commercially-released works
are only financially viable for about 10 years from publication. One wonders whether the
original author who died several decades ago would have been so contentious in their wishes.
This is, of course, even worse for previously unpublished works, which can be of any date but
remain in copyright to 2039.
The EU should therefore evaluate the duration of copyright to establish whether the current
length of copyright significantly benefits rightsholders; whether these benefits outweigh the
burden to education and research; and what economic gains could arise for all stakeholders if
the copyright term were to be reduced.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an

                                                                                                            17
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Since the exceptions and limitations enumerated under Article 5 of the Information Society
Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC) are a compilation of the main exceptions and limitations
that used to pre-exist at national level, most Member States have been conservative during the
implementation process, preferring to leave their national laws as intact as possible. This has
led to a variety of exceptions and limitations being available at the various Member States,
with significant variations in terms of the structure and wording of the relevant provisions.
One such example is the private copying exception, which is not (yet) available in Ireland and
in the UK, and which varies in terms of scope, structure and wording in the remaining
Member States. Because almost all the exceptions and limitations available in the Directive
were optional (with the exception of temporary copying as per Art. 5(1)), the harmonisation
process has not been uniform.
This has become a source of legal uncertainty for both rightholders and beneficiaries of the
exceptions, evidenced by the increasing number of referrals to the Court of Justice regarding
the interpretation of the scope of exceptions and limitations under EU law. Whereas
rightholders who wish to market their works throughout Europe may face obstacles in lack of
a level playing field, end users may find themselves liable for copyright infringement in one
Member State for an activity that is perfectly permissible in another State (Karapapa, Private
Copying, Routledge, 2012).

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
All exceptions in the Information Society Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC) and other existing
and future Directives in the copyright acquis should be implemented as a minimum


orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                       18
throughout the EU. Priority should be given to the exceptions that are justified on the basis of
fundamental freedoms and reasons of public policy. There should also be a simple mechanism
to expand or add exceptions as required at an EU level. For specific examples see response to
Q21.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
An exception expressly permitting e-lending should be introduced for libraries, archives,
educational and cultural institutions. It is important that libraries' collection building policies
are consistent and decided by the librarians themselves, not by publishers and vendors, in the
digital world just as it is in the analogue world.
An exception or limitation permitting both the recording of broadcasts and the communication
of those broadcasts via secure networks for educational purposes, with the caveat that contract
terms and technical protection measures cannot override these exceptions. See response to Q4
and 43.
A new exception enabling data analytics should also be introduced. The currently available
exceptions on research cover activities carried out on individual copies of copyright works,
but do not explicitly permit activities carried out on collections of copyright works. New
knowledge, however, can be generated from the vast amounts of data that are generated
everyday through economic, academic and social activities, through techniques such as text
and data mining and analytics.
The suggested exception should enable the use of copyright works through data analysis for
the purposes of non-commercial research, as long as the source, including the author's name,
is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible and to the extent justified by the non-
commercial purpose to be achieved. Commercial research taking place through data analysis
can be permitted under a compulsory licensing scheme.
This exception should also be accompanied by a parallel exception to the database right. This
can be achieved by a minor amendment to Article 9 of the Database Directive, by making
explicit that “illustration for research” also includes research carried out by means of data
analytics. The reason for this is that wording “for the purposes of illustration for teaching or
scientific research” in this Article has raised controversy as to whether the term “illustration”
refers to teaching only, or to both teaching and scientific research. Moreover, it should be
noted that not all EU Member States have transposed Art 9 literally in their legislation, and
that some of them (including Germany, Greece and Sweden) have left out the illustration-
requirement. It is assumed that data analytics is included in both “purposes of scientific
research” and “purposes of illustration for scientific research”.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
Because of the different national cultures and various legal traditions across the EU, there is a
need for flexible solutions that serve the goal of harmonizing national laws whilst at the same
time respecting national diversity. This however cannot be achieved through a test for judicial
application, such as the US “fair use” test, which is more likely to generate uncertainty than


                                                                                                19
serve the goal of flexibility, especially in those Member States with a continental legal
tradition.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
As mentioned in Q24, offering a test in the form of a US “fair use” provision is more likely to
generate uncertainty than serve the goal of flexibility, especially in the Member States with a
continental legal tradition. There are advantages in such a solution, most notably the fact that
new uses that are enabled by technology can be more safely accommodated within copyright
through judicial examination without the need to revise legislation (see in this regard
Hugenholtz and Senftleben, Fair Use in Europe: In Search of Flexibilities, November 14,
2011). However, it is not clear how this could work in the continental Member States.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Territoriality can be a problem when limitations and exceptions are subject to fair
compensation. There is currently no uniform levy scheme around Europe and those available
are national in scope. An examination of the applicable levy schemes indicates that there are
differences as to the rates and the method for the calculation of levies, even in respect of
identical recording equipment or blank media. As a result, different levies apply in relation to
the same products within the EU. The lack of harmonized framework as regards levies may
have an impact on the free movement of goods across Europe and the development of the
information society.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
This question has been addressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in cases
Stichting de Thuiskopie (C‑462/09) and Amazon.com (C‑521/11). The Court expressed the
position that it is for the Member State (where the harm to the rightholder takes place by the
use for private purposes of their work) and hence the country of the purchaser of the
reproducing equipment to ensure that fair compensation is paid to the rightholder. This also
applies to cross-border transactions. In this light, fair compensation can be charged not only to
the seller but also to the importer of the reproduction equipment.
With regards to the possibility that the levy is imposed twice, there is need for adequate
legislation in line with the position taken by the Court. Even though fair compensation should
be due by the person causing harm, it is more efficient to recover the levy by charging the
manufacturers, and there is nothing to stop manufacturers from passing on the levy to the
users (C-467/08, Padawan).

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
[UK: Education Sector:] copying for preservation/archive purposes (including format-
shifting).
Our archivist struggles with the preservation exception because we cannot guarantee that the
items being preserved will not be used at some stage for direct or indirect commercial
advantage. The inconsistent application of preservation exemptions in the UK means that the
most vulnerable materials, e.g. magnetic audio and video tapes, cannot be preserved
effectively. As viewing such tapes can cause irrevocable damage, it is best practice to make a
preservation copy in parallel with the first viewing – so even the process of assessing their
worth is made problematic by the lack of a consistently applied legal exemption.

We are reliant on commercial transactions with companies wishing to use archival material on
merchandise such as crockery, and if an original item (such as an artistic work) had been
copied in order to preserve it, that copy may be used by those companies. The term “indirect
commercial advantage” in Article 5.2(c) of the Information Society Directive (Directive
2001/29/EC) is too broad and covers too wide an area for this exception to be of much use.
Additionally, the Directive is unclear as to whether several iterations of copying for
preservation can occur, for example, shifting formats several times because technology
becomes obsolete. This is problematic for us as time goes on because increasingly we will
archive tapes, videos, DVDs, CDs and so on, and preservation copying needs to be flexible
enough to allow us to continue copying. Preservation is fundamental to the mission of an
archive, and there is no evidence that this type of copying has been economically
disadvantageous to rightsholders. In fact, in the UK case when the BBC archive lost many
valuable early recordings of Doctor Who44, it appealed to the public to send in their private
recordings. Storage is often an issue for those preserving old fashioned formats, and usually
archivists want to be able to transfer and preserve copyright works on smaller formats so as to
ensure enough space to continue to grow the collection.


29.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

There are a number of legal and economic issues to consider with regards to the preservation
activities taking place in libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives. One of
the most important legal issues is the issue of orphan works, i.e. works whose author is
unknown or cannot be found after a diligent search. Institutional users may refrain from
digitising and making available their collections, as rights clearance of orphan works may be
too cumbersome and occasionally practically impossible. These concerns have been
addressed through the Orphan Works Directive (Directive 2012/28/EU). Problems also arise
with regards to previously unpublished works, which can be of any date but remain in
copyright to 2039.

Any organisation which holds collections of copyright works should be permitted to make
copies of works for preservation purposes regardless of whether they are commercial or non-
commercial organisations. The EU must clarify the scope of the existing EU legislation and
broaden the existing exception to allow institutions to reproduce all types of copyright works
in their collection, otherwise archives and special collections risk losing large amounts of
audio-visual material without having the lawful ability to copy from one medium to another
to keep up with changes in technology. Waiting until copyright expires also dramatically
increases the cost of preservation as the expertise, techniques and hardware required become
rarer and rarer.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
See the comments in Q28 and Q29.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[a: UK Higher Education library]: No specific problems have been experienced because we
do not tend to deal with the actual rights holders of e-Books or e-Journals articles. Our
contractual licences are either with publishers, content providers or intermediary bodies such
as the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) or Eduserv. These require little or no
negotiation in terms of rights access as the contracts are written up with the Higher Education
Institution in mind. There is however a grey area around resources we are allowed to provide
to students in our partner/affiliate institutions. It would be better to have a law which permits
us to supply students with resources rather than being restricted by contract. Additionally,
having to negotiate agreements with rightsholders can lead to a large variety of differing
contracts, meaning that an activity which is permitted by one rightsholder is not permitted by
another. This can create closed communities and end up stifling research.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Changes in legislation are needed so that higher education libraries across the EU are always
permitted to allow off-site access for any student or staff to any materials which it owns or
has a licence for, and that any contractual term that purports to restrict this ability shall be
deemed null and void.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
See comment in Q33. The conditions should be that the services should be provided to
registered users via the Internet.

                                                                                               23

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
[a: UK Higher Education library] One of the problems for us is that we are not involved in
negotiations for e-resources, and so we have to rely on agents or aggregators to do this for us.
Sometimes we end up with contracts which restrict the number of times we can lend an e-
book or which restrict the number of concurrent readers between 1 and 5 users. Some
contracts only permit the downloading by an end user (i.e. a student or member of staff) of the
first 10 pages of an e-book; a spurious figure which has no foundation in law.
We are strongly against these sorts of contracts and associated technical protection measures
which restrict our end users from acting as they would be able to do under the law with print
resources.

37.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Through an exception allowing e-books and e-journals to be purchased and loaned virtually
through remote downloads which does not permit contracts to override it. This exception
should also allow librarians to circumvent technical protection measures to facilitate wider
access for their users. The EU should also confirm that the principle of exhaustion applies to
sales of all digital materials as indicated in the Court of Justice of the European Union’s
UsedSoft ruling. This would create more legal certainty around sale and loan of digital
materials.




                                                                                             24
38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[a: UK Higher Education library] See response to Q36 – our biggest problem is that all online
collections are governed by contract, many of which restrict users from doing the very acts
they are permitted to do under law. Other issues include contracts preventing the
dissemination of or access to resources in other territories, which is highly detrimental to our
students who are studying off-campus.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)46.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

45
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
46
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             25
     NO – Please explain
[a: UK Higher Education Library & Archive]: The 2011 Memorandum of Understanding is
too limited to be of assistance to mass digitisation of copyright works. The stipulation for a
rigorous diligent search would only work for individual rights clearance for one or two
copyright works, simply because it takes so much time to do a diligent search and universities
do not have the staff resource to carry these out. Additionally, the Memorandum of
Understanding will be of little use to our archive as there are no collecting societies for most
of our archival materials (e.g. unpublished literary works and photographs).


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     NO OPINION



B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
Albeit optional, the exception for the purposes of teaching incorporated in Article 5(3)(a) of
the Information Society Directive has been implemented by almost all Member States.
However, the exception has been worded in various ways across Europe and hence its scope
is not harmonised. For instance, these variations have to do with the amount of the portion
that is taken (e.g. short excerpts, or small works), with express enumeration of specific uses
(e.g. use of works in anthologies, or for the purposes of instruction and examination), with
diversities as to the focus of the exception (which may be part of the citation/quotation
exception, or part of a broadly construed exception on private copying that is accompanied by
fair compensation), or with variable focus as to the beneficiaries of the exception (e.g.
institutional users, such as educational establishments, or students through an extended
private copying regime).

47
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               26
As affirmed in Recital 14 of the Directive, one of the purposes of harmonisation was to
promote learning and culture by offering protection to copyright content, while permitting
exceptions or limitations in the public interest for the purposes of education and teaching. It is
not clear if the exception safely covers instances of distance learning or massive open online
access courses (MOOCs), where the use of online technologies is essential.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
One way forward is to make the exception for teaching mandatory for Member States to
implement, but to also afford it a broader scope that cannot be restricted from the potential
application of technological protection measures. See in this regard response to Q4.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
There are resources that can be purchased on subscription, and there are licences which can be
purchased from collecting societies, or teachers can use works licensed under Creative
Commons licences. None of these is totally satisfactory: subscription resources often are not
exactly what teachers require for particular lessons, collecting society licences carry too heavy
an administrative reporting burden, and CC-licensed works are not always high quality
enough, or diverse enough for the specific subject matter that teachers need. An exception is
the only way for teachers to use the works they need.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
There is need for increased harmonization both at European and also at international level.
International treaties, such as the Marrakesh Treaty that was recently adopted for the Blind,
will be the most effective instrument to achieve this end. The exceptions for teaching should
be made mandatory for all Member States and there is also need to broaden their scope to
cover the use of copyright materials in online platforms, such as through the use of hyperlinks
that embed videos.

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See answer to questions 44 and 45.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at
Member States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?


48
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               27
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
Almost all EU Member States have implemented Article 5(3)(a) of the Information Society
Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC), which includes an exception for “use for the sole purpose
of illustration for teaching or scientific research” that applies to the rights of reproduction
(Art. 2) and public communication (Art. 3).
One of the main issues that arise in the context of research in light of mass digitization is the
availability of an exception or limitation specifically encompassing data analytics and mining.
The latter techniques can be used to exploit the potential of the vast amounts of data that are
generated every day in the online environment and generate previously unknown associations
within and between texts, as would be for instance the case in medical research.
In addition, researchers accessing audio-visual materials in their fields are limited by premises
(i.e. they may not take away a copy to work with in their own study environment), which
means that in order to continue their research, they may have to return to specialist archives
and libraries several times. Many researchers are publicly funded and have limited travel
budgets. Online access would transform this situation and this would be particularly helpful to
citizens in the EU’s poorest countries.
Furthermore, publishers require UK academics to clear third party copyright material included
in their journal articles or monographs. Academics are encouraged to clear rights for very
small amounts of third party material and do not have the experience to recognise what
material may be covered by an exception to copyright. For some, the only option is to remove
all third party material, particularly where high reproduction fees are charged, yet academics
and researchers need to be able to show their knowledge and give credibility to their own
work.


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Given the importance of research for innovation and growth, compulsory and clearly worded
exceptions should be created. Data mining can be permitted in the context of the research
exception (see Q47 above). Main problems concern the lack of access to scientific material
due to prohibitive licensing and/or technological protection measures (TPMs). These could
also be solved by promoting and implementing open access principles.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
In the UK, the national copyright law includes a defence of fair dealing for non-commercial
research or private study. Content may also be licensed for the purposes of research and
study; our library in particular pays substantial subscription fees so that students and
academics can access journal articles, but often some terms and conditions only permit the
download of one single copy for the purposes of personal use. Licences are costly and
restrictive, and as a result of the continual increases in price, we are not able to subscribe to
the full breadth of journals and other e-resources we would like, therefore placing our
students and staff at a disadvantage. Like most archive/ special collections services, we have
to operate under both licensing and statutory privilege arrangements because much of our
material is not covered by a licensing scheme. This is confusing for us, never mind the user.

                                                                                              28
D.       Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
[UK Higher Education library]: The biggest problem we have is with regard to the making of
accessible copies for persons with disabilities. This is often due to technical protection
measures in copyright content which do not always work with software that the person with
disabilities has available to them.


51.      If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
The EU must sign up to the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities and then ratify it which would
bring about its implementation in all Member States.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?




E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”53. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
The main problems associated with text mining and data analytics is that the scope of most
exceptions on research covers non-commercial research only and the fact that there is also
need for sufficient acknowledgement.
In the United Kingdom, for instance, reproduction for automated text processing could fall
within the scope of fair dealing for non-commercial research (s. 29(1) of the CDPA).
Although there are a number of similarities of this defence and the US fair use doctrine in
terms of historical origin and justificatory basis, “the ‘uses’ referred to in the [UK] statute are
binding and not just exemplary, and that the non-commercial purpose of the use is a necessary
requirement in case of fair dealing for research rather than merely a ‘factor to be considered’,
as in the fair use analysis under US copyright law. These conditions sensibly narrow the scope
of the defence under UK law. Although the case of reproduction of whole works for carrying
out text mining research is not in principle excluded, this activity would not fit squarely into
the defence. Besides the non-commerciality of the purpose, other conditions narrow the scope
of permissible reproduction. There is, for instance, an important subject matter restriction,
since sound recordings, films, and broadcasts are excluded from the provision. Moreover, the
requirement of ‘sufficient acknowledgment’ may pose an insurmountable obstacle to text
mining. This requirement, too, was introduced in the statute as an effect of the European
Copyright Directive. In its Article 5(3)(e), it allows Member States to provide for an
exception to the rights of reproduction and public communication for ‘use for the sole purpose
of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source, including the author’s
name, is indicated, unless it turns out to be impossible . . . ’ To be sure, text mining is a
situation where acknowledging the source may frequently turn out to be practically
impossible. However, the fact that the UK legislator has included this requirement in section
29 is particularly telling of the kind of situations that fair dealing for non-commercial research
is expected to cover. These are typically occasional acts of copying that are necessary for
human researchers to carry out research— more than systematic reproduction of large amount
of texts or other subject matter by computers. In this respect, the core requirement of the fair
dealing defence— namely that the dealing must be ‘fair’, which implies that the amount taken
should not exceed what is requested by the user—may not be met in the case of wholesale
copying for automated processing” (Borghi and Karapapa, Copyright and mass
digitization. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013, pp. 60-61).


54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
There is a need to introduce specific legislation permitting data analytics under certain
conditions, most notably the three step test of Article 5(5) of the Information Society
Directive. See also Q55.
55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Even though copying for non-commercial research is already permissible under Article
5(3)(a) of the Information Society Directive, it would be opportune to specifically mention
                                                                                                31
activities related to data analytics for non-commercial purposes. This activity too should be
considered as mandatory against its potential contractual restriction (i.e. to fall within Art.
6(4)).

Commercial text mining could also give a leading edge to Europe; especially in the field of
medical research it could have substantial public benefits and an impact on entrepreneurship,
growth and innovation. This however could go against the second step of the three-step test
(Article 5(5) of the Information Society Directive), under which a permitted activity should
not conflict with the normal exploitation of a work. If commercial research was to be
permitted this would have to be under a compulsory licensing scheme.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See the above response to Q55.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded

54
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions55.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions59 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
There are three main points that need clarification with regards to the scope and application of
the private copying exception in the digital environment.
The first is that this exception is not considered enforceable against contractual and
technological restrictions, as it is not compulsory for Member States to set in place

56
   Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.
57

   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:

   Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                         34
appropriate mechanisms ensuring that the beneficiaries of the private copying exception can
claim its benefit (See Art. 6(4)(b) of the Information Society Directive; for a commentary see
Karapapa, Private Copying, Routledge, 2012, 148 et seq).
Second, the concept of ‘private’ and ‘non-commercial’ use is in motion with digitization and
the Internet and it would be opportune to offer a clarification as to their scope.
Finally, the way in which the three step test of Article 5(5) of the Information Society
Directive is drafted leaves enough room to conceive it as a test of judicial application rather
than a test for legislative action; “under the Directive, the test is aimed directly at the
application of copyright exceptions and limitations and not only to their introduction into
national law… In this confusion, several Member States have explicitly incorporated the
three-step test of Article 5(5) into their national laws and have, therefore, put it at the disposal
of judges” (Karapapa, Private Copying, Routledge, 2012, 100 et seq). These Member States
include Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. The test is also applied in Member States that
have not inserted it into statute (e.g. Belgium or Germany). The application of the three-step
test at judicial level “could seriously restrict the scope of applicable copyright limitations.
Since the three-step test was initially adopted as a diplomatic compromise, it is not best suited
for judicial application. As opposed to the fair-use test in the US, which is set as a standard to
be applied by courts, the three-step test does not give judges sufficient latitude for considering
other interests than those of the rightholders, even though copyright limitations are essential
for the preservation of the interests of end users and, therefore, for maintaining the copyright
balance. This is because the three-step test is inherently an economic-prejudice test measuring
the effect that a use may have on the normal exploitation of works and its potential prejudice
over the rightholder’s interests; in every interpretation that this test may receive, the impact of
an activity on the rightholders’ interests is decisive” (Karapapa, Private Copying, Routledge,
2012, 102). This means that the three step test is an additional condition for the application of
the copyright exceptions listed under Article 5 that could further restrict their scope. It is
therefore important to clarify whether the exceptions ought to be subject to a double scrutiny
under the test, i.e. at legislative and judicial level.


65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?60
     NO – Please explain
The concept of ‘possible harm’ is vague and has not been determined by the two recent CJEU
rulings on private copying levies (Cases C-467/08, Padawan v SGAE, and C-462/09, Stichting
v Opus). The impact assessments for the copyright reform that is currently taking place in the
United Kingdom has unveiled the uncertainty as to the meaning of the concept of harm in the
context of private copying. The UK government intends to introduce a narrow private copying
exception covering mainly instances of format shifting, i.e. use allowing ‘an individual to
copy content they own, and which they acquired lawfully, to another medium or device for
their own personal use’. Because the harm of such a limited exception will be minimal, no
payment will be due to the rightholders.



60
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          35
Since harm is central to determine fair compensation for private copying, there is need for
interpretative guidance as to its scope and meaning. This guidance cannot be provided by
mere reliance on empirical data because any empirical evidence ultimately depends on how
‘harm’ is defined. The system of tariff-setting should be based on legal certainty as to the
definition of harm, and empirical data, if any, should only be used to fine-tune the system.

‘Harm’ should be defined by the Directive as prejudice to the legitimate interests of the
rightholders, as reflected in actual or potential losses in sales; ‘loss of sales’ should
correspond to the rightholders’ reasonable expectations and should not include sales that
would not realistically take place, such as sales of multiple copies within a familial circle;
‘loss of sales’ should include ‘lost licensing opportunities’ especially where the content is
disseminated online; ‘loss of licensing opportunities’ should correspond to the rightholders’
reasonable expectations and should not include licenses that would not be realistically
concluded, such as separate licences for each single use of the same work.


66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?61
     YES – Please explain
This obligation should be explicitly introduced in the Information Society Directive. Since
manufacturers and distributors of blank media and recording equipment are expected to pass
on the levy to the end users by adding it in the final price of their products, consumers should
be aware at the outset that the price includes a levy for private copying. This would be in line
with the acquis communautaire on consumer law which requires that information on the
prices of goods and services should be provided to the consumers in a clear, comprehensive
and unambiguous manner. In particular, Directive 97/7/EC on Distance Selling requires that
consumers are provided with information on the price of goods or services including all taxes.
Similarly, the newly adopted Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EC requests that the total
price of the goods or services, inclusive of taxes, should be indicated in a clear and
comprehensive manner.
Beyond consumer law, making the levy visible in all invoices in the sales chain will also be
useful for practical reasons, and in particular for avoiding double payments of the levy in
cross-border sales.
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
61
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          36
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes, which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments.
68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement
schemes could help to remedy the situation.
There are two main ways in which the levy systems are affected vis-à-vis the emergence of
new business models and technological advances: (a) the possibility that end users may be
charged twice for making private copies of works disseminated online and (b) the
indiscriminate application of levies to multifunctional digital media and equipment.
(a) Double payments
In the context of the online dissemination of protected works, it is possible that end users may
pay twice for private copying, i.e. through the levy on blank media and/or recording
equipment and through a licensing fee in order to use technologically protected works, which
may include private copying. Recital 35 of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC however
clearly states that double payments should be avoided.
The Directive should declare that contractual restrictions on the ability of users to make
private copies should be null and void. Similarly, the Directive should exempt from liability
end users who circumvent effective technological protection measures (Article 6 of the
Copyright Directive) in order to benefit from the private copying exception, where the levy
has been paid.
(b) Multifunctionality
With digitisation, most Member States have gradually started to extend the application of
levies to digital equipment and media with some memory capacity, without however applying
uniform criteria and without taking into account the multifunctionality of certain digital
carriers. For instance, levies apply to mobile phones in the Czech Republic, Italy, France and
Spain, without such a levy being imposed by other States. These devices, however, are not
‘dedicated’ to acts of private copying since their primary function is not related to copying; as
a result, the levies applicable to them may be seen as a form of ‘rough justice’. This means
that some end users may end up paying the mobile-phone levy for ordinary use of the phone.
The fact that levies are a ‘blunt instrument’ when applied indiscriminately to recording
equipment and blank media was affirmed by the Belgian Constitutional Court in a 2008
decision (Grondwettelijik Hof/Cour Constitutionnelle, 6 November 2008). Adopting a
pragmatic view on levies, the Court held that the levies are justified in lack of a viable
alternative and, hence, they do not breach the equality provisions as incorporated in the
Belgian constitution.
The Directive should make clear that subject to the levy should only be devices, media and
equipment that, under the common perception of an average user, are directly functional to
activities of private copying. The level of the fair compensation should reflect the use of
media, devices and equipment in the context of reproduction for private purposes and should
only recompense for the actual or possible harm that the rightolders suffer.


                                                                                              37
Whereas the rightholders are able to control and license copying of their works for private
purposes by use of digital rights management, this does not reach a level that would affect the
way in which private copying is dealt with at EU level. In the first years after the
implementation of the Copyright Directive it was feared that the growing use of digital rights
management (DRM) would eventually lead to a natural, market driven phasing out of levies
(see e.g. Commission’s Staff Working Paper on Digital Rights: Background, Systems,
Assessment, 2002). This fear was not materialised to an extent that would affect the way in
which private copying is currently dealt with.
While DRM have lost popularity in the online distribution of certain categories of works,
emerging distribution technologies, such as those based on cloud computing, may enable a
more widespread use of DRM. For this reason, it would be advisable that the Directive creates
legal certainty as to the intersection of the private copying exception, levies and DRM by
declaring the exception imperative against its possible technological restriction, and by
exempting from liability end users who circumvent effective technological protection
measures (Article 6 of the Copyright Directive) in order to benefit from the private copying
exception.

  V.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from


                                                                                            38
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of
infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright

62
   See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
   See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.
64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be
to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be
clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     NO OPINION


76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
     YES – Please explain
The last decade has witnessed an increased focus on the liability of Internet Service Providers
for copyright enforcement at legislative (Arts. 12-15 of the E-commerce Directive
2000/31/EC) and judicial level. There has been a number of cases brought before the Court of
Justice of the European Union on this topic, such as Bonnier Audio (C‑461/10), Promusicae
(C‑275/06), and Scarlet (C‑70/10). In all these instances, the Court adopted a balanced
approach in protecting authorial interests while also respecting areas of fundamental rights,
such as the right to privacy and the freedom to do business. Any amendments to the civil
enforcement system in the EU should reflect this balanced approach and where conflicts
between fundamental rights and copyright arise, the former should prevail over the latter.

     VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.


66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           40
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
   -    Contracts and technical protection measures should not overrule copyright
       exceptions. Too much digital content is governed by contract which can be at odds
       with what the law allows end users to do with the content. Libraries, students,
       researchers and academics should not have to concern themselves so much with
       copyright when they are attempting to fulfil their core missions, namely preservation,
       teaching, learning, research and the pursuit of knowledge.

   -   Deliberately making false claims of copyright ownership, unjustified demands on third
       parties to take out licences when there is no evidence that they are infringing
       copyright, and unjustified threats of infringement should be made offences. This is the
       case for other forms of intellectual property such as patents, and would deter this type
       of behaviour which has increased in recent years.
