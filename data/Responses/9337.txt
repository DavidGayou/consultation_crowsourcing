     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the

effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
V YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).


High price and lack of availability of content is the key domestic/national market barrier
today in Europe for watching on-demand/online content. Naturally, from this follows that
access to on-demand/online content across territories becomes even more cumbersome and
restrictive due to territorial copyright restrictions, licensing conduct, geo-blocking, price
discrimination hold-back and windowing.

Consumers’ understanding of access to TV/Video content is changing as time spent in front of
main screen is stabilizing/declining (see page 6 Consumerlab TV/Media Study 2013) while at
the same time spent consuming content using a smartphone, tablet and/or laptop continue to
grow both in terms of adoption and average time spent. Since these new devices offer
mobility and/or nomadic access to content outside home, content that is available on the first
screen but not on the second and third screen will become evident for these consumers. This
means that consumers conceptualization of already relatively poor on-demand content
availability (figure 4) on the first screen will further decline on second and third screen while
these very same consumers are away from home and particularly when crossing national
borders. In 2011, more than 1 billion holiday trips were made by EU residents (EU-27) of
which ~1/4 or 240 million visits where made in another member state. In addition, in 2011
about 140 million work related trips where made by EU residents (EU-27). These big
numbers tell us at least one story, as opportunity to access “home”/ 1st Screen-TV content via
mobile and/or nomadic devices grows, it is very likely to assume that EU consumers’ while
attempting to access to their “home-content” outside their home territories not only becomes
an evident benchmark of the absent Creative Digital Single Market but also frequently
experienced situation in the whole EU internal market.

How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
Access to content is necessary to develop a certain kind of new online services. Nowadays it
is not easy to define what you have to deal with when you want to build some new service on
copyrighted material. With the current set of copyright law and authors’ rights legal access to
content is a very complex issue, sometimes too complicated to be attractive for operators who
want to launch new offers, that thus are hindered. Confindustria Digitale thinks that the whole
system should be simplified: a streamlined multiterritorial or pan European licensing process,
i.e., is necessary and at least those licences needed to manage content on-line (covering
performance and reproduction rights) should be unified.
Dealing with market rules, the policy maker intervention should in general be desirable only if
justified by market failure. What are possible market failures in the digital single market of
content on-line? The market is at an infant state yet, so that is hard to say, but the question
must be kept in mind. Confindustria Digitale thinks the rationale for the European regulatory
framework for electronic communications should apply also in this case: market analysis
should be the economic base for rules and analysis needs figures an information.
We are experimenting obstacles that hinder innovation especially when audiovisual content is
involved: windows and bundled exclusive rights are barriers to the creation of new services,
that also prevent the industry from exploiting all the possible revenue streams for content
online and from its “long tail”.

5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
V YES – Please explain by giving examples
It can be necessary so as to customise ancillary services, i.e. customer care, call center, IVR,
or to comply with different regulatory framework on censorship and so on.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
V YES – Please explain
The market is too fragmented among Member States, therefore measures towards higher
transparency and harmonisation are welcome. What kind of measures has to be further
investigated.
Before going into the need for further measures, a comment on justification for additional
measures is required. Confindustria Digitale offers some reasons that justify further
interventions:
      Any improvement of cross-border availability of content services must start with the
       assessment of national content availability and in particular the availability of
       digital on-demand/on-line content since this is a prerequisite for effective cross
       border content dissemination and also is an existing policy imperative for the Digital
       Single Market. In other words, EU-wide synchronized DVD release schedule is
       neither relevant nor sufficient ambition of EU Digital Agenda and the EU DSM.
      From a territorial/member state perspective, increased availability of digital on
       demand/online content is also relevant to narrow down the national cultural gap
       in terms of access to physical content in urban vs. rural areas, since access to cultural
       outlets, such as cinema, theater and opera is significantly more limited in rural areas.

                                                                                             11
            Not only will increased digital creative content availability of on-demand/on-line
            distribution increase the opportunities for rural European regions to enjoy culture and
            hereby foster cultural inclusion but furthermore it will increase the opportunity to
            spread cultural diversity across the EU frontier.
From a consumer point of view, accessing culture and entertainment via physical and/or
appointment based methods comes with following short comings:
               the physical availability is restricted to certain locations, to certain days, certain
                times of the day and the amount of available seats, which limits consumption
                opportunities;
               physical screen limitations (number of screens per theatre/city) restrict the range of
                titles available at any given time, which excludes non-block-buster types of films,
                such as independent creations, regional and local productions which limits cultural
                diversity.
Given the socio-economic effects described in section one, We argue that it is in the public
interest and hence policy maker’s interest to balance the self-interest of Creative sectors
with the aim to: promote open and competitive markets in licensed and exempt digital
on-demand/on-line content, with the aim to increase availability of more legitimate pan-
European digital content services, in ways and at prices which appeals to consumers and to
decrease digital cultural exclusion caused by licensing conduct and to make exceptions more
flexible and harmonized, with the aim to promote innovation and growth of the DSM.


What should the interventions aim to achieve?
There is no doubt about the importance of copyright regime and the incentives it creates for
certain market behavior and hence licensing conduct. And in the case of the EU Internal
Market it is unfortunately still too much about non-digital incentives as confirmed by data
presented in figure 4. One can also add to this observation with the observations of Ruth
Towse16; that it is not just enforcement but also the established exploitations models exclusive
rights & licensing that a copyright regime maintains in a market that create moral hazard
effect on incumbent firms to rely on the law rather than adopt new technologies and business
models to deal with new technologies.
           Increase availability of on-demand/on-line digital content for territorial and cross-
            border dissemination, by limiting market/licensing miss-conduct that restricts on-
            demand/on-line availability vs. other formats/platforms
                a. Address the complete absence of legal digital alternatives in the first release
                   window. Limit the length of exclusive first release windows and prohibiting
                   the use of exclusive windows for films with less than 100 copies (the number
                   is relative to size of the home cinema market) in the theatres.17

              productions, allowing digital first window to emerge, e.g. prohibit digital on-
              demand/on-line discrimination.
           c. The growing practice of Hold Back Practices, some distributors can obtain
              from right holders the holding back of VOD rights during the whole TV
              exploitation. Holdback periods are currently not regulated and hence depend
              on contractual negotiations, alone which have important drawbacks for VOD
              aggregators, as it hollows out the breadth and depth of a VOD content library.
           d. A harmonized VAT-rate for audiovisual and other creative services and
              products across the EU frontier should apply regardless of distribution channel
              or platform used to distribute digital or physical content.
      Clearly distinguish between roaming content or remote access to home country
       content access while being in another EU member state from multi-territorial
       licensing.
      Increase market efficiency to clear European works more effectively across EU/EES
       territories by decreasing search, match and clearing transaction costs e.g. via a
       registry, data base or similar.
Furthermore, Confindustria Digitale is not advocating that there must be a condition for the
creator to produce competition in its own exclusive right. However, once a creator has made
the free choice to make its work available in the EU internal market, concerns may arise when
a licensing arrangement harms competition, cultural inclusion and/or innovation among
entities that would have been actual or likely potential competitors in a relevant market in the
absence/presence of a particular license. For example a restraint in a licensing arrangement
may harm competition, innovation, cultural diversity and/or consumer choice, for example, if
it facilitates market division or price-fixing. In addition, license restrictions with respect to
one market may harm competition in another market by for example anticompetitive
foreclosing access for the digital on-demand/online platforms vs. physical cinema, and
DVD physical distribution markets.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC18 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software19 and databases20.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders21 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies22, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks23. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of



18
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

21
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
22
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
23
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               14
a certain Member State's public24. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
V NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach25)
The scope of “Making available” online is not sufficiently clear; this uncertainty de facto
affects the liability exemptions in favour of intermediaries set by the legislation back in the
year 2000. Sometimes the intermediaries have been called by the courts to take actions that
are out of their scope, in order to protect rightholders or prevent abuses online. It should be
clarified that the act of “making available” is done by those that upload content online.
Consumers’ role on the Internet must not be underestimated: the destination of content online
depends on specific request by users; therefore it cannot be relevant in order to define the
meaning of “making available”.

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief26)?

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
25
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
26
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
V YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
In order to build a competitive offer of content online, economic exploitation must be as cost
effective as possibile; nowadays trading of rights is one of the most complex issue to deal
with, therefore it constitutes a high administrative barrier to innovation in legal online
distribution of copyrighted content. Bundling of rights may help, transparency in rights
management has to be pursued.
However, Confindustria Digitale is of the opinion, that in the digitized world where copyright
protected content is made available on the internet by the right holder, it would limit the
availability of the content to mandate any further burden to the consumer. For example, if
there is a copyrighted content available on the Internet and the provisioning of a hyperlink to
such content should be subject to the right holder’s authorization, that will be a limitation for
the consumer, distributor or new innovator and in Confindustria Digitale’s opinion it will be
not in proportion to the potential benefits of control for the right holder. Furthermore, the
provision of a hyperlink does not amount to the transmission of an actual work, which is a
necessary condition for the consideration of a communication to the public. Secondly, it does
not amount to an act of communication to a new public. It must be noted that this question has
been recently referred to EJC in the case C-466/12 Svensson and C-279/13 C More
Entertainment.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU27 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of


27
     Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

                                                                                                          16
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU28 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

V NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Confindustria Digitale thinks that the case C-466/12 Svensson and C-279/13 C More
Entertainment have made clear this issue.
The content you link must be on the Internet already and linking something on the Internet is
a kind of quotation, the ability to do so remembers freedom of speech issues.
Moreover, technically speaking, to require authorisation to link anything on the Internet
would undermine how the Internet works. Ask for authorisation to quote or to refer to any
kind of already accessible content would surely extend copyright beyond its scope, hindering
basic freedoms. What needs to be compliant with IPR is the act of uploading the content.

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
The Internet is made of page viewing; If something is on the net it can be seen. To provide
otherwise for some kind of authorisation would undermine the functioning of the web; that is
even more worring since rightholders for some content are not easy to find (i.e. cfr. “ e
Mozart finì in una fossa comune”, by Fabio Macaluso, page 82: impossible for the author to
find the rightowners of some scenes by Fellini and Antonioni).
To view some copyrighted content is not an infringement, only managing the copyrighted
content, i.e. by uploading it, can be an infringement.
Confindustria Digitale is of the opinion, that in the digitized world where copyright protected
content is made available on the internet by the right holder, it would limit the availability to
the content if such viewing of a web-page should be subject to the right holder’s
authorization. Such limitation for the consumer, platform provider or new innovator are not in
proportion to the potential benefits of control for the right holder. Any change towards a
more restrictive approach makes no sense at all in the digital age.
Temporary reproductions are not considered to be copies other than temporary and are
exempted from the reproduction right in Directive 2001/29, Article 5.1. there is no need to
modify this rule. Furthermore, everyday interactions of users with digital technology give rise
to multiple temporary digital reproductions of fragments of content. These are essential to the
functioning of digital technologies, devices, networks, etc. Hence, according to the UK
Supreme Court and some academics, requiring permission from the newspaper licensing
agency for such uses would break down the internet and “would make infringers of many
millions of ordinary users of the internet across the EU”.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)29. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)30. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as

29
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
30
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18

a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

[Open question]
As far as we know, there has not been any case of successful resale market for digital content
online. It is quite difficult to figure out how it can work, since new physical content can be
distinguished by second hand worn out copy, but it is not the case for online digital content,
where you do not technically have a master and then some other copies.
Allowing resale of digital “copies” would create a secondary market for the same product, so
that even worse problems may arise.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute31. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered32.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
V
31
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
32
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             19
  YES
A registration system developed at a EU-wide level would definitely improve the
identification and licensing of copyright works in digital settings. At the moment copyright
operates by default, i.e. by mere operation of the law, and does not require any registration for
the author of a creative work to gain protection and to enjoy the very broad exclusive rights
conferred by national systems. As a result, today’s copyright ends up covering not only
traditional types of creative work but also millions of works created every day (e.g. Twitter or
Facebook posts, blogs, etc) for which nobody claims copyright protection.
Copyright law has traditionally addressed professionally created content. The absence of a
registration requirement has been seen, also at international level, as an important element that
ensured a better and immediate protection for the author, who did not need to comply with
any formalities in order to acquire copyright ownership. With the advent of digital
technologies, however, creativity has changed radically and has become a much broader
concept. In addition to professional content, which continues to be produced successfully, we
have increasingly broader types and amounts of creative content that is either produced
unprofessionally (i.e. with no expectations of financial gain by amateurs) or released on the
Internet under licensing schemes (e.g. Creative Commons) through which copyright holders
relinquish their rights (or a part of their rights) in order the to make their works freely
accessible. What is known as ‘user-generated content’ is a significant element of a portion of
content not produced professionally that is increasingly shared and transmitted across digital
networks, online content platforms and social networks. Applying traditional copyright rules
to this kind of technology-enabled creativity does not seem desirable, and creates legal
uncertainty for users and right-holders alike.

  NO OPINION


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Administrative costs to deal with right owners would be minimised and thus the creation of an
effective market for copyrighted content online would be fostered.
An EU-wide, Berne-compliant registration system would dramatically improve licensing
considering online services devote a great deal of resources and manpower to licensing.
Moreover, the best antidote to unauthorized works are attractive legal offers. As the
Commission wrote in its Recommendation of 27.10.2011 on the digitisation and online
accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation: "Rights information databases
connected at European level can bring down transaction costs for rights clearance. Such
mechanisms should therefore be encouraged in close cooperation with all stakeholders".
As pointed out by several stakeholders, technology sheds new light on the need for, and the
feasibility of, copyright registries. The vast expansion in the scope of copyright, to cover
billions of works created every day - from Twitter posts, emails, blogs as well as traditional
works, all without the need to claim copyright - has resulted in every day activities being

                                                                                              20
swept within the copyright system. Applying the same copyright rules to this creativity makes
little sense, and creates huge legal uncertainty for users and rightholders alike (see Stef van
Gompel, ‘Formalities in the digital era: an obstacle or opportunity’ - 2012).
The advantages of registries extend well beyond licensing and are were well documented by
WIPO: (1), right owners will have with a simple and effective means to clearly establish
authorship and/or ownership that can be used in commercial and legal contexts; (2)
Registration can also help to delimit the public domain, and consequently facilitate access to
creative content for which no authorization from the right owner is needed; (3) national
registries serve the public interest by providing a source of national statistics on creativity and
culture; (4) Finally, national registries may constitute a repository of cultural works through
deposit.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A registration system that is too complex or expensive will not attract sufficient rights holders
to be valuable. At the same time unless there is a mix of incentives, a registry is also unlikely
to attract attention and buy-in. The Creative Commons experience has shown that it is
possible to build a simple platform, without much funds, where millions of works are
“signaled” on a voluntary basis.
Another disadvantage can be in the hypothesis that unambitious author lose protection, but
remedies to this case can be found easily with transitory clauses or similar.
So the biggest disadvantage (or obstacle) in the implementation of a copyright registration
system in the EU would be the risk of non-compliance with the principle of formality-free
protection embodied in the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic
property, as amended in 1971 by the Paris Act. After this amendment, Article 5(2) of the
convention provides that copyright shall not be subject to any formality. In spite of the
formality-free principle set out at international level, in Confindustria Digitale’s view EU
policy makers should consider implementing those forms of registration for copyright works
that do not seem to enter into conflict with the Berne Convention. For domestic works, for
instance, any Member State or the EU itself could impose mandatory registration as a
condition to have access to certain infringement actions or remedies, as it happens in the US.
Moreover, Member States or the EU could impose such formalities for copyright holders to
obtain those privileges and additional forms of legal protection that are not incorporated in the
legal framework (i.e. the Berne Convention) where the principle of formality-free protection
is provided. In this regard, formalities could be required to obtain protection in relation to
phonograms, broadcasts, non-original databases and for the legitimate application of TPM
and/or DRM. Finally, any Member State or the EU could condition benefits such as prima
facie evidence of ownership of rights on securing a certificate of registration.


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


                                                                                                21
[Open question]
Strengthening of copyright protection is an incentive.
For domestic works, any Member State or the EU can impose mandatory registration as a
condition to bringing of certain infringement actions / remedies as the U.S. does. Member
States or the EU can impose such formalities on other subject matter such as phonograms,
broadcasts, unoriginal databases. For domestic and non-domestic subject matter, Member
States or the EU can require registration prior to applying and/or enforcing TPM and
RMI(DRM); as well as prior to certain ‘Berne plus’ remedies (note: for ISPs and Telcos for
example, issuing take downs might be conditional upon registration). Any Member State or
the EU could condition benefits such as prima facie evidence of ownership of rights on
securing a certificate of registration. In Canada and a number of other countries, for example,
a certificate of registration provides evidence that the copyright exists and that the person
registered is the owner of the copyright. Canadian Copyright Act, sec. 53(2)



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed33, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database34 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition35 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub36 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]



33
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Rights identification systems and repertoire databases are, and will continue to be, essential
for copyright to apply effectively in sectors such as online music, films and other types of
digital content. Markets for products like copyright works can only function in so far as all
information and data concerning rights and their ownership is made available openly, i.e. in
standardized and interoperable formats. Content licensing in the EU Digital Single Market
would be greatly facilitated if all content owners and licensees had proper access to the data
collected in the database.
One example of such tools is the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) in the music sector,
which has been supported by the European Commission. The GRD project is trying to build
up a comprehensive database of global copyright ownership of musical works, openly
available to songwriters, publishers, collecting societies, and users. Unfortunately, a few years
after its launch, the GRD is still moving slowly because of the uncertainties concerning the
conditions under which copyright holders and collecting societies will make metadata
available to the whole working group.


The data bases and registers of copyrighted works should be as open as possibile, in order to
foster availability of information for innovative distributors.
Identification of works is the basic prerequisite of any market to function. In the area of
music, recent discussions on collecting societies have highlighted the need to have transparent
ownership information available. Efforts in this area should focus on open, transparent
identifiers and registries, as well as on effective incentives. Permissions databases and
initiatives such as the LCC do not serve this purpose. They do not aim to improve the
availability of works information, but only to provide a model for permissions data. This leads
to worrying pitfalls: 1) A rightholder unilaterally sets permissions - including, as suggested by
publishers in Licences for Europe, for acts which are not subject to copyright such as linking.
2) A declaratory system of permissions encourages abuses: if rightholders can define
themselves the conditions of licences (permissions) they are like likely to state there should be
a license when the work is not subject to protection (lack of originality), out of protection
(public domain), subject to an exception. 3) Embedding permissions into content is just
another way of promoting a new, more powerful form of DRM all over the web at a time the
content industry is increasingly dropping DRM. 4) Promoting DRMs on such a massive scale
is unrealistic (see data on scale of UGC).


European Commission should continue to monitor the development and make it sure that data
and metadata related to rights ownership and permissions databases are effectively made
available to commercial and non-commercial users and, more generally, to the public by their
respective holders. In addition, we believe that such data and metadata should become
available under open access licenses and should also facilitate full interoperability through the
adoption of non-proprietary and standardized formats

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention37 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
V NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Terms of protection should be far shorter: 70 years is a far too long period, economically
equivalent to an illimitate recognition of rights by net present value methodology.
It is absolutely essential that copyright is based on rational economic principles.
Today’s term of copyright protection in the EU (life plus 70 years) is far too long. As a result
of the term extension directive of 1993, this term is 20 years longer than the minimum term of
protection set out under Article 7 of the Berne Convention (the author’s life plus 50 years).
The main justification for such a long duration, for the Convention parties, was that of taking
care of the author and his or her family. More than a century after the entry into force of the
Convention, the fact that copyright is normally assigned to, or contractually acquired by,
enterprises (i.e. non-natural persons) no longer justifies a term of protection whose main
parameter is the life of the author. Such a parameter is even more flawed if one thinks that
authors are not the main beneficiaries of copyright protection in the long run, especially in
sectors where authors are not assisted by collecting societies, which act as authors’ unions
helping them share their rights with publishers. Enterprises are not people and does not need
such a long copyright term (see below) in order to make their investments in the creative
sectors profitable.

 III.          Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


37
     Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

                                                                                                                 24
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC38.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law39. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)40, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional41, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")42.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            25
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
V YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Optional exceptions can give rise a number of issues: 1) protection of fundamental rights: part
of EU law; they do not stop at the border; citizens and consumers should have the same
fundamental rights in Europe. 2) limitations on the free movement of goods and services:
How can an arts reseller promote the sale of artistic works online when States have enacted
the relevant exception but others have not? How can a library give access to archives to
citizens outside of its country, without an exception, and would this not encourage
segmentation of heritage across national borders? How can one teach online to a European
audience when the legal regimes differ from a Member State to another as to the possibility to
use protected materials? 3) complexity: only one exception is mandatory, all others are
optional. The directive outlines 21 different optional exceptions or limitations and since each
country implementing the directive can choose to either include or leave out the exception
clause the result is that there are 2.097.152 different ways to implement the directive. 4)
European competitiveness: the economies of scale and consumer reach that could be achieved
through a digital single market are not available to companies, services, innovators that rely
on exceptions and limitations.


  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
V YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Harmonisation is important. The need for mandatory exceptions should be assessed taking
into account in particular whether: 1) there is a detrimental impact on the internal market; 2)
fundamental rights and/or the public interest are a strong justification for the exception; (3) an
underlying policy (i.e. economic or innovation policy) is better achieved at EU level.
Fundamental rights, which are protected in the EU e.g. under the Charter of Fundamental
Rights, benefit citizens and consumers who are empowered by the Internet to exercise those
freedoms. These rights are an important, common good, essential to democratic societies. In
such instances there may be a very strong case for mandatory exceptions. For instance in
cases such as parodies, or quotations, or exceptions benefitting the press, ‘the freedom to hold
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public

                                                                                               26
authority and regardless of frontiers’ is a key justification for the exception (Article 10 of the
Charter). For instance, even the Berne convention mandates an exception for quotations.
Member States should be encouraged to make use of existing flexibilities too. To some degree
this allows Member States to develop new approaches to maximize the economic, cultural and
societal benefits of exceptions; these approaches in turn inform other Member States and the
EU on how to best adapt to societal and technological changes.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Removing existing exceptions should not be taken into account. In fact, not only the excessive
scope of copyright drawn many criticisms among the civil society, but exceptions have
become even more necessary to counterbalance the current over-expansive reproduction and
making available rights.
New exceptions are necessary in general. New candidates appear all the time, Text and Data
Mining and UGC are only examples of new, unforeseen developments.
The rise of copy-reliant technologies leads to innovation, by definition unpredictable.
Recognition tools such as Shazam, anti-plagiarism softwares such as Turn It In, are examples
of services which rely on reproducing a vast number of works. They constitute non-
expressive and transformative uses, which do not harm the market for the original work, nor
take away any value from those works.



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
V YES – Please explain why
Norms which do not allow clearly uses which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of
copyright works and do not unreasonably prejudice the interests of rights holders are
detrimental to culture, society, economic growth and innovation.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
A) The notion that European countries and courts cannot deal with flexibility in copyright is a
pervasive fiction. It is a harsh and unsubstantiated judgement on the abilities of Member
States and European courts. It also misrepresents reality. National as well as EU copyright
rules already contain several provisions which give rise to interpretation by courts. Examples
of this are: 1) the flow of copyright questions to the CJEU, an evidence that the copyright
regime is increasingly judge-made. The CJEU is increasingly acting like a Supreme Court in a
more openly flexible copyright system. 2) the three-step test (Art. 5.5 of the Directive
2001/2)] already provides a flexible instrument which is used by national courts as well as the
CJEU. The three-step test illustrates the existence of flexibility, as some argue that it is used
to curtail the application of existing exceptions. According to such views, the three-step test
would be an example of ‘legal uncertainty’. The more balanced view is that the three-step-test
is an instrument of flexibility that works both ways and allows flexibility for the benefit of
users too. Several Member States are introducing new exceptions in EU copyright, including
additional flexibilities - the Irish “Modernising copyright” report.


B) Flexibility has a positive effect, on society, growth and innovation / economics. The need
to recognise flexibility in copyright is supported by a growing body of legal and academic
literature, as well as by a growing number of countries. Advantages for Economic growth and
competitiveness: 1) Lisbon Council, Intellectual property and innovation: A framework for
21st century growth and jobs (2012): “Europe’s digital economy desperately needs better
conditions in which to grow. That means, first and foremost, a legal framework for
intellectual property which addresses the growth agenda”. 2) A 2010 study found that
industries that rely on exceptions and limitations that balance copyright laws represent Euro
1.1 trillion, or 9.3 percent of the EU’s GDP. They employed close to 9 million people and
were growing 3 percent faster than the rest of the EU economy (SEO Research, Economic
contribution of EU industries relying on exceptions and limitations to copyright - 2010). 3)
The UK government estimates that benefits of a reform of copyright are considerable: “adding
between 0.3% and 0.6% to the size of the UK economy by 2020 – between £5 billion and £8
billion [€5.72 billion and €9.15 billion] – and cutting deadweight costs in the economy by
over £750 million [€858 million]” (Vince Cable, George Osborne and Jeremy Hunt, The
Government Response to the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth
(London: HM Government, 2011). 4) Innovation: Internet and the wave of digital innovation
it brings are a source for growth and jobs. The pace of innovation is increasing, and
innovation is almost by nature unpredictable, but provide innovation friendly IPR frameworks
would help avoiding the drain of innovation outside of Europe. 5) Social benefits: such a
norm would help copyright law to regain legitimacy among EU citizens.




                                                                                              28
C) Licensing is not an alternative to flexibility: 1) Licensing non-consumptive/non-expressive
uses and/or transformative uses (UGC, data-mining) is not justifiable. Such uses do not
conflict with the normal exploitation of copyright works and do not unreasonably prejudice
the interests of rights holders - in other words, a text that would be fit for uses which comply
with the provisions of international treaties binding the EU. 2) Licensing brings potentially
insurmountable transaction costs: in many cases (for digital at least) innovators have limited
resources to deal with such costs; time (another transaction cost) to the market is critical for
success; and since the use is by definition new, (i) there are no existing licensing
infrastructures to deal with the issue and (ii) reaching agreement on a price structure is time
consuming (e.g. for something as mundane as streaming on Spotify, agreeing on price
reportedly took a long time). Technology may help reduce the per-unit transaction costs, but
the proliferation of copyrighted content means that total transaction costs for any technology
aimed at the internet have increased dramatically. To date, a licensing solution dealing with
the scale, decentralization and heterogeneity of the internet does not seem on the horizon,
even for relatively ‘traditional’ services (digital substitutes for a physical good, e.g.
download). 3) Licensing cannot account for Fundamental Rights - i.e. the justification for a
parody/criticism exception is not ‘transaction costs’ but that the owner of content would have
the power to control speech criticising his work. That would be detrimental to a free,
democratic society. Newspapers are a prime example of how re-using facts and news is
beneficial to society. 4) A fundamental part of the copyright bargain is that ideas, facts etc. are
not subject to copyright as the burden of such a monopoly on society would be unbearably
costly. Licensing temporary reproductions would in many cases re-constitute a monopoly on
facts and ideas (e.g. data-mining). 5) Subjecting new non-consumptive or transformative uses
to copyright would allow (i) a copyright owner to potentially block or diminish the value of
the innovation (e.g. hold up scenarios), and (ii) to derive rent in a situation where his
incentives to create in the first place are not impacted.


D). There are several ways in which flexibility could be maintained and expanded: 1) One is
to provide for an open norm in the EU Directive - examples include Article 5.5 of the Wittem
European Copyright Code, supported by prominent scholars, or the Irish “Modernising
copyright” Report. Transformative and non-expressive uses should be recognised as not
infringing copyright, in line with the three-steps-test. 2) The Commission may commit to
encouraging Member States to make use of flexibilities available under the current legal
framework. A Communication or Recommendation which, as a first step, encourages and
recommends to MS that they make use of the existing flexibilities under the 2001/29
Directive. 3) The Commission may make clear that the harmonisation of rights under the
acquis is full harmonisation, in particular that the creation of new IPR should not be pursued
nationally, as these create new obstacles to the single market and may circumvent existing
exceptions. 4) The Commission could also issue transposition and/or interpretation guidelines
to the 2001/29 Directive, highlighting existing flexibilities. It should be clear that Member
States are permitted and encouraged to promote new, flexible exceptions. Flexible use of the
three steps-test should also be recommended. 5) The Commission could also envisage
mechanisms to consider the expansion of such new exceptions to an EU-wide level, should
they prove important for the single market.



                                                                                                29
26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
V YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
The Commission well knows the conclusions of the Vitorino report on private copy levies,
that are an obstacle to the functioning of the single market; any difference on exceptions to
copyright fragments the market for innovative services built on content, even not covered by
copyright, as in the hypothetical case of UGC with different rules among Member States.

[Open question]
In order not to hinder the level playing field principle, the applicable rules should be set at the
EU level, in most cost-effective way.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving43 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions44. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive45.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to

stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other46. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)47.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?


46
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
47
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC49 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC50 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 51.

The Marrakesh Treaty52 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]

51.       If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
Accessibility is not a technological issue, as far as many technologies can be used to help
disabled people; it mainly is an issue of copyright towards the publishing industry, that is not
always keen on making its own content available for usage with those technologies.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics53 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”54. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are

                                                                                           40
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs55. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions56.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
V YES – Please explain by giving examples
Users of online services regularly see content taken down, blocked, or in some cases
monetized for the benefit of the wrong person. While some services operate rights
management tools to assist in identifying re-used content, these cannot fulfill the role of
determining whether a particular use qualifies under an existing exception. This can result in

55
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

the blocking of content which is lawful and falls under existing copyright exceptions. Some
cases are not always clear. There are well-known cases on the “baby dance” on a Prince music
and similar ones.
This can also result in the wrongful attribution of ‘ownership’ in the remix. For example, a
‘remix’ which qualifies as a creative work and which falls under the parody exception might
be treated by a system as being a reuse requiring permission for the owner of the parodied
content. Systems cannot determine whether a re-use is a parody. As a result, when the owner
of the parodied content chooses to authorise re-use against remuneration, remuneration
generated from the parody will be wrongly attributed to the owner of the parodied content.
The recent ‘Lescure report’ (Rapport de la Mission « Acte II de l’exception culturelle » :
Contribution aux politiques culturelles à l’ère numérique (May 2013), p. 425 et. seq.) in
France unambiguously states that there should be a safe legal framework for all users who
create content.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
UGC is often misunderstood as only a call for a new exception. In reality, the scale, diversity
and value of the content created by users (whether remixes or not) bring to the fore broader
questions:


Scale of UGC:
User engagement: Across 9 EU countries in 2013 (France, Germany, Italy, UK, Netherlands,
Ireland, Sweden), BCG finds that about eight in ten Europeans consumed UGC or participated
in a social network during the past 12 months; about three in ten uploaded a video or personal
picture online; and nearly two in ten were editing or managing a blog or website: BCG,
Follow the Surplus: European Consumers Embrace Online Media (2013).
In the EU-28, according to Eurostat, close to 23 million Europeans engaged in creating a
website or blog in 2012, including 14% of EU citizens aged between 16 and 24 years old.
Over 83 million Europeans uploaded self-created content to a website, including 47% of 16 to
24 year olds. 11% of Europeans posted opinions on civic or political issues via websites.
Pew Research Center- US: (a) Creativity: Photo and Video Sharing Grow Online (October
2013): 54% of internet users have posted original photos or videos to websites (up from 46%
in 2012) - - 81% amongst 18-29 years old - and 47% share photos or videos they found
elsewhere online (up from 41% in 2012) - 68% amongst 18-29 years old. (b) Remix: 40% of
adults who post videos to online sites post “videos that mix content and material in a creative
way”: Pew Research Center, Online Video 2013 (Oct. 2013). In 2010, among Internet users,
21% of teens and 15% of adults reported creating “remixes.”: Pew Research Center, Social
Media & Mobile Internet Use Among Teens and Young Adults (Feb. 2010).

Value of UGC:
●       “provides citizens, consumers and students with information and knowledge.
Educational UCC content tends to be collaborative and encourage sharing and joint
production of information, ideas, opinions and knowledge, for example building on
participative web technologies to improve the quality and extend the reach of education”
(OECD).
●      “The cultural impacts of this social phenomenon are also far-reaching (OECD)”.
●       “Open platform enriching political and societal debates, diversity of opinion, free flow
of information and freedom of expression [...] Furthermore, blogs, social networking sites and
virtual worlds can be platforms for engaging electors, exchanging political views, provoking
debate and sharing information on societal and political questions” (OECD).
●      “Talking back to culture”: remixers are fans who engage with culture, not pirates.
Culture is not static, but alive - remixing breathes life into culture.
●       “Remixes produce valuable cultural and political commentary. They are particularly
attractive to groups underrepresented in [...] mass culture—women, nonwhites, and LGBT
individuals, among others—who use remix to talk back to that culture, to identify what it’s
leaving out and explain what they see” (Organisation for transformative works).
●       Learning and appropriating creative skills: from Shakespeare, Milton, La Fontaine (i.e.
Aesop) to Dali (i.e. Da Vinci), Proust (i.e. Flaubert) and rap, creators engage with previous
creations, re-use them, learn skills.
●     Bibliography: Lessig’s book Remix. Making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid
economy, online at http://remix.lessig.org/


Policy Implications (1): Change of paradigm
●      Copyright rules that were designed with content created ‘professionally’ in mind are at
odds with today’s creativity. The overwhelming majority of content created today is no longer
produced by legacy copyright industries with legacy distribution models in mind. The
majority of today’s crop of users and creators now bears the costs of a system designed for
legacy business models, while the later reap the benefits.
●       The rules designed for ‘professionally produced’ content within organised creative
industries are at odds with UGC.
●       For instance, does it make sense that a tweet or facebook post is potentially protected
70 years after the death of its author? UGC brings to the fore questions such as the term of
protection, the application of private copying levies, the role of formalities or registration, as
well as limitations and exceptions.


Policy Implications (2): limits of permission-based licensing for ‘re-mix’

                                                                                               44
●      licensing only caters for major online services - users cannot share content on their
own sites for instance;
●      licensing is slow and cumbersome: licensing solutions may not be available for new
services wishing to allow UGC; nor is it feasible to license each and every individual user.
●      Some uses are not for copyright owners to licence: there are rational reasons for a
rightholder to refuse a licence, e.g. in the case of criticism or parody (see examples below)
●      Remixers and parodists are not pirates, they’re fans:
○       a study for the UK IPO on UGC on YouTube found that there was no evidence for
economic damage to rightholders through substitution, and that presence of parody content is
correlated with, and predicts larger audiences for original music videos.
○       The French Lescure Report notes that user generated parodies and remixes contribute
largely to the success of original content, taking Psy’s ‘Gangman Style’ as an example
(Rapport de la Mission « Acte II de l’exception culturelle » : Contribution aux politiques
culturelles à l’ère numérique (May 2013) page 425).


●     Unclear or overly restrictive legislation also leads to abusive take downs, aiming to
wrongfully take down content. Examples:
○      Lenz v Universal - issued for barely audible background music - see EFF;
○       Spanish "anti-piracy" firm Ares Rights - uses copyright to issue take-downs on
content criticising Ecuador or Argentina (techdirt, Dec. 2013)
○     Music publisher issues copyright takedown to blogger criticizing hip-hop artist Akon
(EFF)
○    YouTomb, an MIT research project which collects videos wrongly removed from
YouTube.



62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
As explained above, UGC brings to the fore important questions on how to adapt copyright in
light of the way the vast majority of content is created today by users.
●       For example formalities and registries, term of protection - and more generally
distinguishing between commercial and non-commercial activities.
●       For users re-using existing content, Canada has demonstrated that it is possible to
adopt a clear limitation for the creation of ‘remixes’. UGC Canada Copyright Act (article
29.21).
●      UGC is also an example of transformative, creative uses that was not, and could not be
foreseen at the time of the drafting of the 2001/29 Directive. As such, it could be addressed by


                                                                                             45
introducing flexibility at a more general level, for the benefit of creative and transformative
uses.
●       Another option would be to clarify the scope of existing exceptions and encourage
Member States to implement them, and to so in a comprehensive manner, to cover creative
and transformative uses.
○       For example, after considering the limitations of the current implementation of
existing exceptions under French law, the Lescure report recommends such action in relation
to the exception for quotations (Rapport de la Mission « Acte II de l’exception culturelle » :
Contribution aux politiques culturelles à l’ère numérique (May 2013) pages 428-429 and
432).
○      For example, it should be made clear that implementing a UGC exception under
national is deemed compatible with the EU legal framework.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying57. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5859.

   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-

                                                                                                         46
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions60 in the digital environment?
V YES – Please explain
In our view there is a strong need of clarification ad EU level on the private copying and
reprography exception and on the relative fair remuneration. The exemption must be made
clear with respect to piracy and to the new business model that are based on licensing
agreement.
On the first aspect, it must be set by European rules that pirate copies are not private copies:
they are an illicit behaviour that has to be pursued under the law; on the contrary, setting a
levy on piracy would be perceived as a pardon, an indemnity for piracy itself and would
seriously hamper any attempt to shift consumers’ attention towards licit behaviour and legal
offers.
On the second aspect, we completely agree with mr. Vitorino’s findings, as explained in the
next answer.
Recent experience with the Italian procedure to set the levy for private copying are trying to
refer to an hypothetical “European average”, that doesn’t exist. It would be helpful, and it
would solve some of the problems highlighted by mr. Vitorino, to set levies within the EU
with omogeneus criteria and procedures, so as to apply the levy on the same products and at a
comparable amount on money.
The scope, application and level of copyright levies continue to increase rapidly and vary
substantially between Member States. Industry faces a fragmented market with substantial
legal and financial uncertainties. An obligation for Member States to file with the
Commission all their copyright levies and the publication by the Commission of exhaustive
up-to-date data would greatly increase industry visibility and reduce legal uncertainty.


Clarification on the scope is also needed regarding illegal copies, user-generated-content,
professional use, public domain, and all other elements which should not fall within the scope
of the exception.
Regarding the compensation for acts of private copying, it has to be unambiguously
confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively based on harm and therefore
should only exist if there is a proven substantial harm to right holders. Also the term “harm”
must be more precisely defined.
In the absence of such clarifications on the scope and the application of the exception, the
levy system is clearly out of control as historic definitions allow unlimited claims from
collecting societies leading to an unreasonable and unjustified accumulation of levies for
consumers and industry.

Finally as noted by Towse: “…copyright levy… has been almost universally opposed by
economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to the
market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators”.61 This
observation made by most economist points to a failure or a broken concept in current copy
right system that fails to deliver on key policy objective and that should make up for the key
basis to grant rights holders with statutory monopoly powers with the aim to stimulate
investments in intellectual property. In other words, in the absence of such economic
incentive, the statutory monopoly power is reduced to a narrow privilege.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?62
           – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
V NO – Please explain
Digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been
licensed by rightholders must not be subject to private copying levies, because the inclusion
of these cases in the private copy exemption would allow for a double remuneration on
licensed content and this is undesirable for market design and effectiveness.
Licensed copies should not trigger the application of private copying levies.
Mr. Vitorino concludes that content licensed through online business models, e.g. legal
downloading and streaming services, should not be subject to levies (“licensed copies should
not trigger the application of levies. The opposite view would pave the way for double
payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double payments”).
As he summarizes, right holders have already received compensation for licensed content
including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between right holders
and users. In this respect, it appears that the private copying of licensed copies does not cause
any additional harm to right holders; therefore no extra compensation is justified. Any
additional payment on top of the amounts that were already paid as part of the license fees
would paramount to double-compensation. The current private copying system does not
consider this fact and creates a significant problem of double payment as a result. This is

harming the licensing model. Also, the CJEU confirmed in its judgment in the VG Wort case
that compensation is due only when harm is suffered.
Applying private copying levies to authorized copies of licensed content is in direct
contradiction with paragraph 4 of Article 6(4) of the Copyright Directive. In such regard, art.
6(4) provides:
“4. Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1, in the absence of
voluntary measures taken by right holders, including agreements between right holders and
other parties concerned, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that right
holders make available to the beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided for in
national law in accordance with Article 5(2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or (3)(e)
the means of benefiting from that exception or limitation, to the extent necessary to benefit
from that exception or limitation and where that beneficiary has legal access to the protected
work or subject-matter concerned.
A Member State may also take such measures in respect of a beneficiary of an exception or
limitation provided for in accordance with Article 5(2)(b), unless reproduction for private use
has already been made possible by right holders to the extent necessary to benefit from the
exception or limitation concerned and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5(2)(b) and
(5), without preventing right holders from adopting adequate measures regarding the number
of reproductions in accordance with these provisions.
The technological measures applied voluntarily by right holders, including those applied in
implementation of voluntary agreements, and technological measures applied in
implementation of the measures taken by Member States, shall enjoy the legal protection
provided for in paragraph 1.
The provisions of the first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to works or other subject-
matter made available to the public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that members
of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them”

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Nowadays levies are not imposed on cloud computing. Since cloud computing services using
copyrighted content are developed on a licensing base, imposing a levy would only give way
to a double remuneration for something that has already been traded by interested parties.
This result would undermine the correct functioning of the market for digital content and cost
of services would increase.
It seems incomprehensible to extend the levy system which is not functioning in the offline
world to online services. The Vitorino report clearly indicates that the attempts to broaden the

                                                                                              49
interpretation of the private copying exception not only are to the detriment of right holders
and legal offers based on license agreements, but are also legally questionable and should not
be supported.
Right holders already receive compensation for licensed content including subsequent copies
in the framework of licensing contracts between right holders and users. Applying the unfair
copyright levy system to cloud services would result in unjustified triple payment by
consumers (for the licensed content, for the connected device, and for the cloud service).
It should also be noted that private copying levies are currently applied to devices which
contain a storage capacity, as it was assumed that since devices with a storage capacity can be
used to copy protected content they should all be subject to levies. In the case of access based
cloud services, storage capacity is not needed and applying levies on them is thus irrelevant.
One of the main advantages of cloud services is their global nature; therefore imposing
territorial/national levy systems on global services seems unfeasible and absurd, especially
considering the principles of the Single Market.
Cloud computing allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides artists
with new distribution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be able to access digital
content from several connected devices at all times and from anywhere.
European consumers and internet users would be the first victims of the imposition of levies
on cloud services since prices would most certainly raise because of levies. Companies of all
sizes, which are increasingly using cloud services, would also face this consequence.
Imposing levies on cloud services would also have negative impact on European cloud service
providers, as the obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden would
significantly limit their competitiveness in the global market. The negative impact on new
business models would be immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit the
attractiveness, competitiveness and future development of business models based on new
technologies.



67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?63
V YES – Please explain
Visibility of the levy in the invoice of those products that are subject to levies would bring
increased transparency and awareness among customers even if this could also increase the
risk of “copyright levies shopping” between Member States. We believe that the burden of
providing information should be borne by those who benefit from the revenues of the levies.
In case the EC decides otherwise, we believe that proportionality requires that the costs are
borne by rights-holders. Distributors should not have to pay copyright levies and bear the
financial burden of informing end-users.
Transparency towards consumer is the best tool for their protection.

     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments64.

undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
In Italy an ex-post reimbursement scheme is set, but it is not effective and many professional
users prefer to pay the levies rather than go through the complicate procedures for
reimbursement.
It is years that Confindustria Digitale is asking for an ex-ante (or a priori) rule to make
effective the professional exemption.



71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
A throughout analysis of the fundamentals of private copying should fix a straight regulation
at European level, homogeneous among the Member States.
Regarding the issue of liability for payment of levies, Confindustria Digitale
recommends maintaining the existing liability regime:
     shifting liability to retailers was rejected by Member States during the Competitiveness
      Council of 29 May 201365
     maintaining liability with manufacturers in combination with predictable ex ante
      exemption schemes was identified as one possible option in the Vitorino report 66, (while
      shifting liability to retail was the other option).
     maintaining liability with manufacturers/importers has also been suggested in the Castex
      report67 and is supported by most JURI Committee members 68
     manufacturers market shares are more concentrated and consistent across member states
      than relevant retail market shares69
     a few, concentrated, global manufacturers are better equipped ( due to consistent pan-
      European market presence, better resourced and operate on higher economies of scale) to
      come up with an efficient common pan-European technical solution to collect levies
      effectively than retailers, especially SMB, who are less concentrated and less homogenous
      across the internal market.
     the case made by those promoting shift to retail is constructed on complex argumentation
      based on several interdependent policy actions being implemented beforehand, e.g. “if and
      then” assumptions about policy implementations regarding: common definitions,

       overall simplification. Obviously, the necessity of such complex argumentation regarding
       what would seem to be a seemingly straight forward issue, questions fundamentally the
       merits and sensibility of the case for a shift.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers70 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract71. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
We think that only a virtuous cycle between network infrastructure and services and content
creation can really boost growth for all the stakeholders, in the knowledge based economy
Europe wants to become according to the Lisbon agenda. That is the reason why we give our
contribution to this question although we do not represent authors or performers.
An effective virtual environment can be a crucial competitive advantage for the European
economic system, but its development is a complex issue, with many actors. The best way to
ensure that creators benefit from new revenue streams is to encourage the growth of online
services. More media is being produced than ever before, and many of the creative industries
are growing thanks to the Internet and digital platforms.
●     The Internet has been a boon to creativity. Today, more music, more video, more text,
and more software is being created by more people in more places than ever before.
●       IFPI reported that the recording industry grew its revenue in 2012 for the first time in
over a decade, to $16.5 billion.

was generated by digital (30bn Euros).

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE72 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text73. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed

content is used for a commercial purpose74. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure75. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
V NO – Please explain
We share the view expressed in the Digital Agenda: that it is essential to carefully review the
need for additional measures to reinforce protection against IP infringement in the online
environment in order to ensure that, if any are actually needed, they are “consistent with the
guarantees provided in the Telecoms Framework and fundamental rights on data protection
and privacy”. With that in mind, some of the issues addressed in these questions have far-
reaching implications not only for European competitiveness, but also for access to
information, freedom of expression and participatory democracy. These topics must be given
due consideration if Europe is to achieve its economic objectives and uphold its core values.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The EU’s intermediary liability regime is the cornerstone of online business in Europe, as it
has brought economic growth and benefits by facilitating innovation. In a recent Report on the
Economic Impact of the current online intermediary liability regime in the e-Commerce
Directive, Copenhagen Economics concluded that in 2012, online platforms - such as
ecommerce and video-sharing sites, search engines, social networks and cloud computing
providers - contributed more than €430 billion to the European economy, up from €310bn in
2009.
The report outlines how online platforms participating in Europe's Single Market benefit the
EU economy in three distinct ways:


74
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
75
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           55
●       Direct GDP contribution. In 2012, online platforms contributed more than €220 billion
directly to EU 27 GDP. This contribution has increased by €60 billion since 2009.
●       Long term indirect GDP contribution. In 2012, online platforms contributed €210
billion to the European economy due to the productivity impact of intermediary platforms on
other companies, up from €150 billion in 2009.
●      Economic impact beyond GDP. In 2012, online platforms contributed an additional
€640 billion of value via business-to-business platform revenues, online advertising and the
consumer benefit derived from the use of free services.


The online intermediary liability regime has made this economic value generation possible: if
online intermediaries were held liable for the hosting, caching or transmitting of 3rd party
content, it would create additional legal uncertainty and have an adverse impact on innovation
severely limiting the economic benefits the Internet has brought. The EU's intermediary
liability regime - when properly applied - has also upheld the basic rights and principles of
freedom of expression, privacy and the right to access information online.


Policy-makers should however focus more on the real cause of the problem, namely the
revenue sources (both from ads and payments) that motivate operators of these rogue
websites, instead of censoring sites or enabling private rights of action against law-abiding
advertising and payment networks. Operators of these rogue websites are in it for the money,
cutting of their revenue stream(s) will push them to close down these websites.
Looking at revenue sources, the following principles should be applied:
1.      Focus on the right targets: Rogue foreign websites operate far beyond the reach of
European courts and law enforcement authorities and are wilfully and primarily set-up to
violate copyright law or to traffic counterfeit goods.
2.      Follow due process: Trademark and copyright owners already collect evidence against
such rogue websites. Legislation should enable them to notify the appropriate judicial
authorities. The website targeted would then be notified and have the possibility to counter-
argue the claim.
3.     Cut off / seize the money: If a judicial authority is indeed convinced that a website is
rogue it could issue an injunction against the website which would oblige advertising and
payment networks served with the injunction to stop conducting business with this website.
4.      No private right of action: When trademark and copyright owners deem that
advertising and/or payment networks are wilfully failing to comply with their obligations to
stop conducting business with a rogue website, then the judicial authority, and not private
lawyers, should be authorised to seek injunctive relief against these advertising and/or
payment networks.
Instead of long and complex legislative process or fast track proceedings without adequate
legal safeguards, the focus should be on self-regulatory mechanisms.




                                                                                            56
●      A multi-stakeholder discussion to enforce measures aiming at cutting off the source of
revenues of infringement online would be more effective and proportionate without prejudice
to fundamental rights.
●      Self-regulatory mechanisms as such can more effectively address new or rapidly
evolving, and often time sensitive, subject matters.
●       These measures would also increase rights holders to invest better because it would
ensure that their disputes will be swiftly resolved.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
V YES – Please explain
As far as the current attention to protection of personal data remains a cornerstone of the
European values, the balance is right and this attention needs not to be relieved in order to
cope with copyright respect.


  NO – Please explain

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
V YES
  NO

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
This must surely be ne next step in the development of copyright in the EU if we want to
build a real and effective single digital market for European work and therefore strengthen
both European online environment and European content industry.
This surely is a longer term project, because it will be necessary to “fine tune” some territorial
aspects that can still be needed to manage rights in the best way, since different features still
characterize national markets.
