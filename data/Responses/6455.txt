SHARE Defense is a part of SHARE Foundation established with a goal to fight for the public’s interest in
every critical battle affecting digital rights within the fields of privacy, free speech, government transparency
and efficiency, fighting mass surveillance and promotion of human rights and positive values of openness,
decentralization, and free access and exchange of knowledge, information and technology. Our long term
goals are obtaining sustainability of a free and decentralized Internet and implementing standards of human
rights in the digital environment.

SHARE Defense decided to take part in this public consultation in order to promote a positive reform of the
current copyright system, so it could be adapted for the digital era, since the current copyright system, which
was established in the analog era, is unfit for today’s world and the Internet in particular. Furthermore,
SHARE Defense wants to make sure that people’s basic human rights are respected, such as the right to
privacy and the right to freedom of expression and the right to freely seek, receive and impart information.

Having all this in mind, we submit to you the following proposals.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please
explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
Sharing of information and knowledge is necessary so we can have an informed society that will be able to
bring decisions for the benefit of the society as a whole. Therefore, keeping filesharing/torrenting for private
and non-commercial purposes illegal is unacceptable from a human rights perspective, because in order to
protect copyrighted material from filesharers, law enforcement agencies would have to surveil citizens and
their electronic communications, which is a breach of their right to privacy.
It must also be noted that the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Ashby Donald et co vs.
France, found that a conviction based on copyright law for illegally reproducing or publicly communicating
copyright protected material can be regarded as an interference with the right of freedom of expression and
information under Article 10 of the European Convention. Europe has a long tradition of cooperation based
on equality and transparency in science and culture, therefore any legislation concerning the Internet must
reflect that.


20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
No, they are not. Copyright that lasts for too long greatly hurts the public domain, which has the deterioration
of culture as a whole as an end result, since users do not have the right to use, reuse, adapt, remix and
improve on an already existing work of art that is currently under copyright protection, at least not without the
explicit consent of the rights holder. Protection terms should be much shorter from the current lifetime plus
70 years for authors, 50 years for performers, 50 years for phonograms, 50 years for film producers and 70
years for broadcasting organisations. This duration must be reduced to enhance access to knowledge and
culture more quickly and to reduce the problems (such as orphan works) that surface when rightholders do
not actively exploit their works. As a first step the term of copyright protection should be reduced to the
minimum requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). But, what we
are aiming for in the future is an optimum duration of 30 years after the first publication.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
right holder?
The ability to freely send links from one source to another is one of the fundamental building blocks of the
Internet. Users do it every day when they post on Facebook, tweet, write blog posts and comments, etc.
Requiring the authorisation of rights holders before being allowed to place a link to a resource that is
available online would break the Internet as we know it and lead to a nightmarish “permission culture”.
Rights holders have sufficient rights that allow them to control if they want their works to be available online
or not. Once a work is published online anyone must be free to link to the work. It is like putting a footnote in
a document.


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s
computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
When you look at a website, parts of what you see on the screen are copied on the hard disk of your
computer. These copies are currently exempt from copyright by the 2001/29/EC directive. More generally,
your everyday use of digital technology creates multiple temporary digital copies of content, which are
essential to accessing and sharing content on the Internet.
Requiring the authorisation of the rights holder for viewing and reading content that is already available
amounts to an additional permission which could lead to citizens infringing the law by merely accessing
websites. This directly affects the Internet users’ fundamental right to receive, impart and search for
information. Critically, this is about citizens’ right to read.
65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has
been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?


Today there are a lot of services that allow users to purchase and download digital content (music, books,
TV series, movies...) which can then be used on different devices and platforms. If you pay for a certain
digital product, you should be able to make copies for personal use on all your devices without having to pay
several times for the same product or pay more money for a device because it might be used for storing
copyrighted files (you already paid for).


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
rightholders’ revenue on the other?


Users should not have to pay additional random charges for ‘theoretical’ copyright infringements when using
online services.
Businesses developing new online services need legal certainty, and should not be burdened by levies that
would compensate a loss that is not proven. The European Union should think about boosting creativity and
innovation before adding some extra layers of burden.
77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between
the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and
protection of personal data?


The current copyright system is completely tilted towards the rightholders, and does not take users’ rights
much into consideration, if at all. Copyright should aim to encourage creativity and innovation for the benefit
of the society as a whole. However, current copyright law fails to achieve its dual mission, as the notion of
consumers’ rights is absent.

Consumers do not know what they can and cannot do with copyright protected material. The current
legislation is simply out of date and fails to respond to the challenges of the digital environment.

Copyright protection must, in no way, lead to a disproportionate breach on basic freedoms, such as the
freedom of expression, nor should it breach one’s right to privacy. This was noted in the European Court of
Justice’s decision in the of SABAM vs. Netlog, which states that current European law does not allow for the
imposition on webhosts to establish a generalized surveillance of communications through their networks.
Any change that may come should not undermine this balance by harming the protection of personal data
and the right to privacy.
78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as
a single framework for enforcement?


Yes, the EU should pursue a single Copyright Title, since the EU is a single market and it would be easier for
both holders of copyright and users of copyrighted material if the rules for copyright protection were the
same in all EU member states.
However, establishing a single EU Copyright Title would almost certainly lead to a creation of a
supranational agency that would be charged with protecting the rights of copyright holders in the EU. While
we recognize that as a necessity, such agency should in no way have overreaching authority, ie. it should
not be able to order ISPs to monitor online activity of its users with an obligation to report on possible
copyright infringement in its network.


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


At present, the EU only obliges EU countries to adopt one exception (regarding temporary acts of
reproduction), while the adoption of the others is optional. As a result, something that’s legal in one country
could be illegal elsewhere. An example of how unworkable a non-compulsory implementation of the
limitations and exceptions is can be found here: http://www.smarimccarthy.is/2011/08/copyright-
combinatorics/

All exceptions should be made mandatory for all EU countries, and specified as not exhaustive. It should
also be stated that these cases must be interpreted as applying to ‘similar uses’ and add a more general
open norm based on ‘fair use’ or general principles of fairness.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


The current EU copyright regime offers some form of flexibility, but in practice everything tends to fall under
copyright unless it is covered by a specific exception in the law.

The trouble is that these exceptions are narrow, specific and technologically outdated: the list was written in
2001! This was well before YouTube, Facebook and Twitter were created. As a result, everyday habits of
online users could be considered illegal today. A blogger linking to copyrighted content, a meme based on a
copyrighted image, a video with some footage from an existing movie or a song: all of that could create
issues for the user that posted them.

Other countries such as the US use a principle called ‘fair use’: Fair use means you can use copyright
material as long as the use is fair, for example reporting the news, parody and satire or education.
Europe would benefit from such a flexible concept, that can adapt as technology changes. It would also
ensure that copyright focusses on what it should, instead of, for example, making it illegal for teachers to
share PowerPoint presentations with copyrighted material on websites or by e-mail.
