TYPE OF RESPONDENT:


Representative of publishers ("right holders")


Collective Management Organisation




   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
        A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services
        from anywhere in Europe?
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?


NO.


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?


Not applicable.


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]


Although PLS is a collective management organisation it is not a licensing body. We collect
mandates from right holders for collective licensing and authorise the Copyright Licensing
Agency (CLA) and NLA media access (NLA) to license on our behalf. We distribute the
monies collected from collective licensing back to right holders according to the usage of
their publications. Please refer to the responses of CLA and NLA for their responses to this
question on our behalf.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
We are not aware of such problems in the publishing sector.

                                                                                            2
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?


NO. We would only ever impose territorial restrictions if instructed to do so by right holders,
e.g. because they themselves hold limited rights.


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?


Not applicable.


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?


NO. We do not believe that any further copyright based measures are necessary to increase
the cross-border availability of publishers’ content.




         B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
         needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have




                                                                                              3
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief1)?


NO OPINION



1.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.    [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?


NO



2.     Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?


YES, to the extent that:
(a) the hyperlink enables access in contravention of the terms upon which the rights holder
makes such work accessible, whether such hyperlink enables circumvention of a paywall or
DRM or otherwise or
(b) the hyperlink is comprised of or includes text that is protected as the whole or part of a
copyright work as the hyperlink would involve the reproduction of such work in whole or
part, as the case may be. We refer to The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd & Others v
Meltwater Holding BV & Others [2011].



12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES, to the extent that such use might have independent economic significance which could
contravene the interests of the right holder under the Berne three step test.

  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 4
3.        Download to own digital content
13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



           C.    Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


NO. Large numbers of works are already registered on a voluntary basis with the relevant
collecting societies in each Member State. The PLS database alone holds the works of over
3,000 publishers.
The UK’s Copyright Hub aims to link existing databases together. Whilst the Hub is in its
early days there is no territorial restriction on which databases can link to it.
The cost and commitment of keeping a database up to date is considerable as new works
come into existence and the ownership of works constantly change. This work is already
being undertaken at a national level within the collecting societies and there is no justifiable
reason to impose an additional costs burden on right holders by duplicating such efforts.
In addition, there already exists a comprehensive set of international standard identifiers for
most sectors. In the publishing industry the ISBN, ISSN, ISNI and DOI identifiers are
amongst those that have been widely adopted over several decades.
We do not see what benefits an additional EU level system could add to the current voluntary
system of licensing and identification that is already so well established.
However, support and encouragement at EU level for all sectors to adopt and apply the
existing identifiers would be beneficial. This would complement the work of the Hub and
would in turn support copyright licensing.



16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

                                                                                                   5
[Open question]


We are not aware of any possible advantages.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


Please see our response to Question 15 above.


18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]


Right holders generally choose to register their works with a relevant collecting society as a
means of getting paid when their works are being actively exploited. This appears to be a
sufficiently compelling incentive for right holders to register their works. Less than 1.5% of
the monies paid to PLS for collective licensing and which is available for distribution to
publishers is allocated to works that have not been registered. Once we trace the relevant
publishers they generally always opt to register their works.
We cannot suggest any incentives that would make registration at EU level any more
attractive.




         D.    How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]


The wide adoption of standard identifiers is critical to a well functioning market in licensing
digital content and ensuring that right holders are paid accurately and in a timely fashion.
This was a key conclusion of the report by Richard Hooper and Dr Ros Lynch, Copyright
Works: Streamlining copyright licensing for the digital age, published in July 2012.
PLS relies on identifiers to ensure that monies allocated to the copying of particular works are
distributed to the correct right holders.
The EU’s funding support for the adoption of identifiers and data building blocks as well as
the GRD and LCC initiatives, as outlined in the Copyright Works report, would help to
promote ever more effective copyright licensing.



                                                                                              6
        E.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?
20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

YES. Any change to the term of protection must be supported by robust evidence as this
would have a direct impact on right holders.




  II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

NO, we are not aware of any problems arising either nationally or across borders.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

NO. The flexibility of the copyright framework is arguably one of the reasons that copyright
has adapted so well to the demands placed upon it by different territories as well as new
technologies and why it has endured for as long as it has. Market conditions vary from
Member State to Member State and exceptions to copyright should be responsive to such
conditions if they are to satisfy the Berne Three Step test. They should therefore not be
mandatory.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


NO. We are not aware of any new public benefit purposes or market failure that would justify
any change to the carefully balanced catalogue of existing limitations and exceptions.
For the avoidance of doubt, refusal to take out a licence on the grounds of pricing should not
be mistaken for market failure. Furthermore, any challenges to tariffs in the UK can be
properly addressed through the Copyright Tribunal.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


NO. The current optional catalogue has not presented any problems that we are aware of. The
uncertainty that inevitably comes with greater flexibility could result in unwelcome and costly
litigation.



                                                                                             7
25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?


NO.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]


Exceptions should not have cross-border effect and should remain flexible, as per our
response to Q22 above. This issue does not therefore arise.




        A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
  YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

                                                                                             13
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?


NO, not directly but please see our response to Q54 below.



54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


Text and data mining involves accessing vast quantities of texts and data, as acknowledged in
the Consultation Paper. It raises several different issues which need addressing on a case by
case basis, including by way of example only:
(a) The purpose for which text and data is to be mined
       - is it for the purpose of scientific research or for some other purpose? If so, what?
       - is it for commercial or non-commercial purposes?
(b) Is the text and data to be mined protected by copyright or made freely available, e.g. on
open access or the internet or in some other way?

(c) If protected by copyright, who owns it, where is it and how can it be accessed?

(d) What format is it in? Is this format appropriate to the TDM tools to be applied by the
miner? If not what needs to be done to adapt it?

(e) How are the results to be presented and how long will they be available for?

The answers to the above questions will differ from miner to miner and from text to text,
making any legislation unlikely to be able to provide a complete solution that would satisfy
either miners or content owners.

A more realistic and practical solution is through licensing. Licences offer more flexibility
and the possibility for a more rapid response to the changing needs of the market than
legislation. The current legislative framework is sufficient to allow for such licensing.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
                                                                                                14
We refer to the work of the publishing industry and over the past year in relation to
developing solutions and in particular sample licence clauses. This work is summarised in the
Pledge given by the Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers Association (STM) in
Working Group 4 (in which PLS participated) in the Licences for Europe stakeholder
Dialogue in 2013:
http://www.stm-assoc.org/2013_11_11_Text_and_Data_Mining_Declaration.pdf


We also refer to the detailed outline in the PA’s response of the continuing work of the
publishing industry in developing appropriate and proportionate solutions to the issues raised.


Finally, as mentioned in both the above responses, PLS has been developing a clearing house
to enable researchers to reach multiple publishers through a single point of contact by
completing a single and simple form which will provide publishers with the information they
need to consider any request for TDM. The beta version (i.e. a basic but functional version) is
due to be launched by end April and in the meantime the prototype can be seen at:
http://plsclear.pls.org.uk/ This will be supported by a sample licence similar to that developed
by STM but which will be more tailored to meet the needs of smaller publishers.


57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
Please see our responses to Qs 54 and 56 above.



We do not propose to respond to the remaining questions as they are not directly relevant to
our day to day business.
