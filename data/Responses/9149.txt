     I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.   WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCESS MANY ONLINE CONTENT SERVICES FROM
ANYWHERE IN EUROPE?



[THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF THE RIGHTS INVOLVED IN DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS AND
THE SEGMENTATION OF THE MARKET THROUGH LICENSING AGREEMENTS]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protec-
tion in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member
State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences
remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting
them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-
                                  1
country basis under national law .
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming service,
or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national terri-
tory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to
grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several
Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-
                                                                                      2

                                  5
in the Linked Content Coalition .
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the
ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing
them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-
visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the fur-
                                             6
ther development of cross-border portability .
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to,
services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made
available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available
in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across bor-
ders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is available in all Member States, consumers can-
not access the service across borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if they try to
access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their
country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clear-
ing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders
and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the
problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
                                                                                   7
including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to
other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compli-
ance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and
TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software).

 In view of the extensive harmonisation of copyright in the European Union, at least in the
 online sector there are hardly any noticeable differences that could impede commerce.
 Hence the causes of the restricted availability of online services in some EU countries and
 the lack of cross-border availability do not lie in the territorial nature of copyright.

 According to the information provided by numerous DSPs (Digital Service Providers), the
 real difficulties lie instead in the different taxation, regulatory and technical distribution re-
 quirements of markets. Where licensing difficulties arise, they result primarily from a frag-
 mentation of the substance of rights (different repertoires, authors’ rights versus related
 rights, collectively managed rights vs. rights managed individually by publishing compa-

 werden.          the territoriality principle with the result that licences could no longer be
 granted for the territories of individual Member States would lead to a race to the bottom. As
 a result, users would then endeavour to obtain licences in the territory with the lowest re-
 muneration in order to use them throughout Europe. As the natural reaction of the market,
 one may expect alignment of the amount of remuneration paid in Europe, the result being
 that there would no longer be lower prices for economically weaker markets (e.g. new Mem-
 ber States). This would complicate the development of new services in those countries.

 It is also important to point out that a territorial right can be licensed multi-territorially. In the
 music business especially an efficient infrastructure for the cross-border licensing of copy-

 vices. Politicians should devote their attention to promoting such licensing models.

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
  Insofar as there is mass and uncontrollable use of rights or where there is a fragmentation
  of rights, rights management by collecting societies or other one-stop-shops can make
  sense. Insofar as the rights are not granted to the collecting societies, they can continue to
  be managed individually.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a ser-
vice provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in
certain European countries)?

recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he
is trying to access)?

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are
essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject
matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or
                                 12
prohibit the making of copies , (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the uploading of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a
user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right,
                                                                                            13
i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks . These rights
are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload,
the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of “making availa-
ble” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act
of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the
content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a rele-
                                                                       14
vant criterion is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's public . According to this approach the
copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “target-
ed” by the online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in
a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.       Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when con-
tent is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member          7 / 39
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
It is disputed whether this right is merely a right to make available and an additional retrieval
right, or both together. It is important to clarify that it is a two-step right of use consisting of the
making available and transmission of the work to the party retrieving it. Hence the right does not
depend on the actual act of retrieval and is infringed when the work is made available for retrieval
purposes. Since transmission of the work to the party retrieving it constitutes part of the right,
the work is made available to the public in every country for which it is made available as intend-
ed and in which it can be retrieved as intended.

The country-of-protection principle is to be retained. There should be no introduction of the
country-of-origin principle.

The following aspects should also be taken into consideration with regard to the introduction
of a “country-of-origin” approach:
    The right to make available set out in Art. 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 on Copyright in the In-
     formation Society is implemented by Art. 8 WCT. Introduction of the country-of-origin prin-
     ciple solely for the making available to the public by countries within the EU would be con-
     trary to Art. 8 WCT, the reason being that the EU would split implementation of the right un-
     der Art. 8 WCT.
    The introduction of a country-of-origin principle only where a work originates in Europe also
     appears problematic because the level of protection in copyright has not yet been fully
     harmonised. This applies especially to the author’s moral rights. However, there are also
     differences between the Member States as regards enforcement, despite the EU Enforce-
     ment Directive 2004/48. Irrespective of this, the country-of-protection principle should be
     upheld in general.

9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “mak-
ing available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are consid-
ered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on
                                                                                                          16
your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief )?

      YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
    According to the country-of-protection principle (Art. 8(1) Regulation Rome II), the prerequi-
    sites and legal consequences of a copyright infringement are governed by the law of the
    country in which the relevant act of use took place. As regards making available to the pub-
    lic, this means every country for which the work is made available as intended an in which it
    can be downloaded as intended (see Question 8). It is therefore important to clarify in the
    Recitals that as a matter of principle the right has to be acquired and remuneration paid for
    every Member State in which the work can be retrieved as intended. According to Art. 5(3)
    of Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 (Brussels I), international jurisdiction for the enforcement in
    court of an infringement of the right to make available to the public depends on the “scene
    of the crime”, i.e. the place where the allegedly infringing act took place. This means that
    the matter can be taken to court in every country in which the work can be downloaded as
    intended. In this respect as well it would be advisable to clarify that the ECJ has recently
    adopted a different approach towards determining jurisdiction at the scene of the crime
    (ECJ decision of 19 April 2012, C-523/10 – Wintersteiger, with repudiating comment by
    Lehmann/Stieper JZ 2012, 1016; ECJ decision of 3 October 2013, C-170/12 – Pinckney, with

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several
reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction
right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably
when the two rights are held by different persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to
a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create prob-
lems for you?
    YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems
(e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bun-
dling of rights")

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They
are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before
          17
the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes
an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works
and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his
                                                    18
computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered
by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC.

11.      Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisa-
tion of the rightholder?


  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific cir-
cumstances, and why


Yes, insofar as it is not a normal reference via hyperlink to a source, but, rather, so-called em-
bedded links or so-called framing, e.g. if texts are concerned where the user can no longer
establish that they do not originate from the party placing the link, but have been appropriated
from the website of a third party.

In principle, as regards the assessment of hyperlinking under copyright law, we agree with the
view adopted by the ALAI (Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale) Executive Com-
mittee on 16 September 2013, as published in its "Report and Opinion on the making available
and communication to the public in the internet environment - focus on linking techniques on
the internet". The ALAI publication can be accessed here:

According to the ALAI Report, the consent of the right holder is required in the following cir-
cumstances:

       where the copyrighted content to which a link is placed is made available to the public
        without the author’s consent; or

       where effective technical protection measures have been circumvented; or
       where the availability of the copyrighted content otherwise conflicts with the declared
        or implied will of the right holder.

Especially the first of the above-mentioned three categories is important where the prosecution
of infringements is concerned. As an example we would like to refer to the judgment handed
down by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) on 15 August 2013, Case No. I ZR 80/12,
“File-Hosting Dienst”, which was published in GRUR 2013, 1030. In its judgment the Federal
Court of Justice (BGH) assumed that publication of a link to a data file stored at a share hoster
can constitute unlawful making available to the public (decision of German Federal Court of
Justice (BGH), loc. cit., para 28).


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circum-
stances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public – or to a
new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific cir-

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circum-
stances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
 No, provided that the rendering perceptible of works that underlies the viewing of a website
 can be sufficiently covered by the existing rights of use.

 The mere viewing of a website on a screen does not as such affect copyrights. In this respect the
 freedom to enjoy a work, which exists in the analogue environment, should also apply in the
 digital environment. The temporary reproduction made during browsing on the internet does
 however encroach upon copyrights (Art. 2 of the Directive on Copyright in the Information Socie-
 ty). The balancing of interests between right holders and users takes place at the level of limita-
 tions. If the relevant contents were lawfully made available on the internet, then the requirements
 of Art. 5(1) of the Directive on Copyright in the Information Society have been met, apart from
 this the restriction on private copies can apply. Whether or not the same applies to unlawful con-
 tents will be decided in the near future by the ECJ (Case C-314/12, UPC Telekabel Wien v Con-
 stantin Film). Application of Art. 5(1) of the Directive on Copyright in the Information Society and,
 if necessary, legislative clarification is indicated by the parallel to the broadcasting right, where
 the broadcast alone is covered by copyright law, providing legal certainty for users. However, an
 argument against this is that contrary to radio broadcasts, internet contents are often made
 available in countries where there is no effective legal protection. The right holder will be de-
 prived of protection if he is unable to take action against the user in such a case.

                                                                                                         10 / 39
Where works are made available unlawfully, the exploitation rights and the relevant restrictions
have to be drawn up and coordinated such that action can be taken against the viewing of such
works. If necessary, Art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright in the Information Society
would have to be amended accordingly.

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions
arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them
or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case
of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,
                                                                                  19
the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article) . The issue that arises
here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its
                                                                                     20
effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) . This raises difficult
questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward
and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market
of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical
goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

       14.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the con-
       sequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
       digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


       If the resale of digital media were possible without the author’s consent, then the right
       holder’s content would compete against qualitatively equivalent content offered by the
       reseller. It is here that a decisive difference to the resale of analogue media lies. Admit-
       tedly, where digital media are purchased the rights of consumers require protection, yet
       such protection should be ensured under contract law, especially the law governing
       sales, and by controls on standard terms and conditions, but not by expanding exhaus-
       tion contrary to the system. Where forms of use in the area of cloud computing are con-
       cerned, where the user no longer receives a permanent digital medium, the principle of
       exhaustion under copyright law fails.

19
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
20
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited period
of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is exhaust-
ed on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in case of com-
puter programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it
reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule con-             11 / 39
stituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
         Furthermore, right holders would have to factor resales into the purchase price. Since
         the extent of online resales would be incalculable at the time of the first sale, the eco-
         nomically required purchase price would either be difficult to calculate or it would have
         to be so high (e.g. since sales would be reduced by the high price) that it would not be
         acceptable for the buyer or for sellers.


         If one wanted to permit the exhaustion of online data files, then one would have to con-
         sider revoking or restricting the private copying exemption under Art. 5(2)(b) of Directive
         2001/29/EC in the online environment. Otherwise sellers would be permitted to keep the
         copyrighted subject-matter by means of their (identical) private copies even if they delet-
         ed the originally purchased “original data files” from their computers following the sale,
         as required by the ECJ in the UsedSoft case (C-128/11). They would keep the private
         copy made beforehand. Since the private copy is identical to the original, every seller
         could de facto keep the copyrighted subject-matter – in the form of a private copy - de-
         spite having sold it. This would enable a kind of legal P2P sales platform. Not in the form
         of a snowball system as where unauthorized file-sharing platforms are concerned, but
         most likely in that a single original data file would be sold several dozen times, each time
         presumably being copied (privately) several times, in which respect the “fair compensa-
         tion” pursuant to Art. 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC currently does not match the
         amount achievable where an original is sold.


         For this reason as well, an extension of the principle of exhaustion would be misguided.



C.         REGISTRATION OF WORKS AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER – IS IT A GOOD IDEA?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the
area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibi-
                    21
tion is not absolute . Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or con-
stitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older
works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disad-
                                                                          22
vantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered .

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
      YES,
     if the registration documents adequately record who holds which rights to which work and
     if this information is regularly updated. A voluntary registration system could be expanded
     for this purpose. In this respect the explanations on Question 17 should also be taken into
     account.

21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the formalities
as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being       12 / 39
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

 Knowledge of who holds the rights would be beneficial in order to facilitate their acquisi-
 tion. However, this means that existing entries in the register concerning the rights holder
 would have to be updated regularly and changes in rights ownership notified.




17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

 On no account may registration be required for the accrual of copyright protection. This
 would be in breach of Art. 5(2) of the Berne Convention. Secondly, registration would be
 time-consuming and entail considerable expenses. Most authors could not be reasonably
 expected, for example, to have all drafts and further developments of their works of applied
 art, or all photographs, registered on a regular basis. A small registration fee would also be
 far too expensive for most authors and other right holders. Apart from this, every entry in
 the register would have to be verified, otherwise serious problems could arise if unauthor-
 ized persons registered the works of third parties in their own names so that the genuine
 author had to take action against such entries in the register. This on its part would entail
 considerable verification expenditure. For works of art, works of applied art and works of
 architecture, for example, the deposit of works would result in considerable additional ex-
 penses.
  The register would have to be updated regularly if the right holder changed.

  The register would be incomplete because it would not apply to works outside the Europe-
  an Union and presumably no registration requirement would apply to past works.

  Registration of works can only be voluntary. It would make sense in this respect to avail
  oneself of the existing registration of works with collective rights management societies.

  Mandatory registration is to be rejected also because it would lead to a two-tier society.
  Those who could afford and take the time for registration would ultimately be at an ad-
  vantage over those who are unable to afford it or make the effort; for the risk would be that
  with regard to non-registered works the impression would arise in user and exploitation
  industry circles that use without remuneration was permitted and that no effort had to be
  made in order to acquire the rights. Mandatory registration with the corresponding authori-
  ties would not be the right path to take.




18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

  Registration could involve a presumption of rights ownership. However, there are two
  sides to this coin since registration could be abused by unauthorized persons so that the
  genuine author and right holder would be compelled to defend himself or herself against a
  presumption operating in favour of the unauthorized person.




                                                                                                  13 / 39
D.        HOW TO IMPROVE THE USE AND INTEROPERABILITY OF IDENTIFIERS
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective
management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser
extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be
compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have
                 23
been developed , and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or
other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve
                                                                                           24
the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once
operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
                                            25
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expres-
sion and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the de-
velopment of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in
                                               26
all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step fur-
ther, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permis-
sions databases?

 It is essential to introduce a system of identifiers throughout the EU. In doing so recourse
 should be had to existing systems of the collective rights management organisations and
 other organisations, and such systems should be accessible by means fo meta search en-
 gines if appropriate.




E.        TERM OF PROTECTION – IS IT APPROPRIATE?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the
term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone
                                                                                            27
(in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a
minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the
EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a
term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection.

20.   Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environ-
ment?
     YES – Please explain

     There is no reason to distinguish between analogue and digital and to therefore introduce
     different terms of protection.

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International Stand-
ard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

However, it would be important to stipulate in copyright contract law that authors are to
receive a financially adequate share in the exploitation if the work is used again or regular-
ly during the term of protection. A term of protection calculated on the basis of the au-
thor’s death and lasting for 70 years after that date makes sense only if the authors and
their close relatives receive what can be coined a pension as long as the work can be
used.

In addition, the term of protection should be of the same length for all combinations of
works. What was harmonized for compositions of music with texts should also apply to
other combinations (e.g. text with illustrations, music and dance, or other combinations of
different types of work) (see in this respect Art. 1(1) of Directive 2011/77/EU of 27 Septem-
ber 2011 on the term of protection).

Likewise, Art. 1(2) of Directive 2011/77/EU should apply not only to phonograms and per-
forming artists on music recordings, but also to audio-visual performances.

In some cases the terms of protection in the Member States for works of applied art (de-
sign) vary. These terms of protection should be harmonized throughout the European Un-
ion.

Apart from this, the following inconsistencies arise regarding the term of protection for
related rights of performing artists:

Firstly, it is unacceptable for one and the same performance to be protected for 70 years
on phonograms, but for only 50 years on videograms. The result is two different terms of
protection for one and the same performance where live opera recordings are concerned.
The curtailed protection for films does not mean that they are generally available at an ear-
lier point in time. Owing to the copyrights to the cinematographic work, which in part are
held by the producer, he is able to exploit the film economically even 50 years after it was
released, without any reduction in prices. Yet the participating artists no longer receive
any remuneration. They should at least participate in the exploitation during a term of pro-
tection lasting 70 years.

Performing artists are also at a disadvantage vis-à-vis phonogram producers as regards
the commencement of the term of protection. Through Art. 11(2) of the Directive on Copy-
right in the Information Society, Art. 3(2) of the Directive on the Term of Protection was
amended for phonogram producers to the effect that the term of protection for perfor-
mances that were originally communicated to the public – for example on the radio – but
not published until years later commences on the later date of publication. In contrast, for
performing artists Art. 3(1) of the Directive on the Term of Protection remains unchanged,
turning on the earlier date where performances are first communicated to the public and
then published. A performance broadcast in 1960 as a live broadcast, which then lan-
guished in the archives for 49 years and was not released as a phonogram until 2009, gen-
erates related rights protection for the performing artists as from 1960, whereas rights ac-
crue to the phonogram producer starting in 2009. This discrimination against creative, per-
forming artists is inacceptable; Art. 11(2) of the Directive on Copyright in the Information
Society should be expanded to include performing artists.

These inconsistencies should be rectified.

      II.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected sub-
ject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent
(for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At
                                                                                                        28
EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC .
                                                                                                                                     29
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law . In
accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can
only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or
other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other excep-
                                                              30
tions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) , these limitations and exceptions are often
        31
optional , in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few
of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general
enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions
included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in
terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only with-
in the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the
                                                                            32
authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B") .
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of
rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm
inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not
obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering
a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for
illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the
level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to en-
sure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify
that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of
rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be in-
troduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certain-
ty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

    Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an or-
phan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and can                                   16 / 39

22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  Yes, with regard to private copies. There is mass and uncontrollable use in this respect. It
  should at least be compensated. In the absence of such exceptions the authors are gener-
  ally deprived of compensation, as is the case with the decade-long practice of private cop-
  ies in England. This results in unequal treatment since English authors and other right
  holders participate in the proceeds of private copying where their works or subject-matter
  are used in Germany, whereas no corresponding remuneration flows to German authors
  or right holders whose works or subject-matter are used in England. It also leads to mar-
  ket distortions, which have to be avoided. Reasonable compensation has to be paid for
  private copies. The only sensible way of collecting and disbursing such compensation is
  through the collective rights management organisations. For this reason harmonisation of
  the exceptions for private copying must not fall short of the existing level of protection
  under the system of levies on equipment and storage media, as exists for example in
  Germany and France.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


The mere placing of hyperlinks should not be considered a direct infringement of copyright. At
the most, liability can arise under the aspect of intermediary or secondary liability. The same
applies to links displayed by search engines. If the ECJ holds in case C-466/12 – Svensson that
the placing of a link amounts to a form of communication to the public and that the right hold-
er’s consent is required, then a limitation for (simple) linking should be drawn up. In contrast,
the assessment of framing or the display of third-party works as embedded content should be
left to case law (awaiting the forthcoming decision of the ECJ in case C-348/13, Best-Water
International). See in this respect also the explanations on Question 11.

etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

     Basically speaking, the compensation should be paid where it is possible to control the
     use, including viewing of a work, i.e. in the country of the user and through the collective
     rights management societies there.




A.        ACCESS TO CONTENT IN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and
exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums,
                                                                                                 33
as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and
enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institu-
     34
tions . The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical cop-
                                                                                      35
ies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive .

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or
whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, ques-
tions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other
subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possi-
ble framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural estab-
lishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of frag-
ile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preser-
vation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the
type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the

mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also,
the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

      In Germany such use is enabled adequately by the provision in Sec. 53(2), first sentence
      No. 2 of the German Copyright Act (UrhG). It reads as follows:

            “(2) It shall be permissible to make single copies of a work or to have these made
            […]
            2. for inclusion in a personal archive if and insofar as the reproduction is neces-
            sary for this purpose and one's own personal copy of the work is used as the mod-
            el from which the copy is made,
            […] if in addition,
            1. the reproduction is effected on paper or any similar medium by the use of any
            kind of photographic technique or by some other process having similar effects, or
            2. exclusively analogue use takes place, or
            3. the archive acting in the public interest and pursues no direct or indirect eco-
            nomic or commercial purpose.”

2.      Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter
(consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such es-
tablishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires au-
thorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers.
Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the condi-
tions for, granting online access to collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote
access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of re-
search and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collec-
tions of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the premis-
es of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users
that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the
works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
See Question 33.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

33.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 Contracts should be given preference where the number of licensees is manageable (e.g. in
 libraries etc.). Statutory limitations and claims for remuneration based on such limitations
 could apply where contracts are not offered at reasonable terms.

3.      E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs
and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for
libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights
holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are
currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, includ-
ing direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.


36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying
to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders,
of books or other materials held in your collection?
                                                                                                           20 / 39

37.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 Generally speaking, preference is to be given here to reasonable contractual offers or li-
 censing through collective rights management organisations. Statutory licences and statu-
 tory claims for remuneration based on such licences can only be an alternative solution. It is
 essential to ensure fair compensation for authors.



The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the manage-
ment of physical and online collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What
problems have you encountered?
See Question 37.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’ tradi-
tional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-
premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encoun-
tered?

     Where online use is concerned, subsequent use can no longer be controlled. Such use re-
     places regular acquisition.


4.         Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and
archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to pre-
serve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples are efforts by
                                                          th
libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 century or whole collections of pictures of his-
torical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce
works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to
facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements
between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies repre-
                                                 36
senting authors and publishers on the other . Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be
found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to eve-
ryone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on
the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need

40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation
projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your coun-
try to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements conclud-
ed between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of com-
merce works can be accessed across the EU?
      YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

     In Germany the provision on works that are out of commerce is limited territorially. Apart
     from this, it only covers works published before 1 January 1966. In addition, the provision
     is limited to written works or to certain organisations.

     The Memorandum of Understanding on out-of-commerce works (MoU) of 2011 was imple-
     mented in Germany in 2013. Statutory provisions will take effect as of 1 April 2014 which
     enable collective rights management organisations to grant rights for the digitisation and
     making available to the public of out-of-commerce works published prior to 1966 to librar-
     ies and other privileged institutions. In particular, subject to certain requirements (e.g. entry
     in a register kept at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA)), the new provision
     sets out a statutory presumption of rights management by the competent collective rights
     management society. However, the question of whether or not cross-border use of such
     out-of-commerce works is lawful has not yet been resolved. There are certain indications
     here that a sound legal solution can only be found at the EU level. In the MoU the European
     Commission was asked to examine the question of legislative regulation of cross-border
     use at the EU level. The outcome of this examination has not yet been announced.

B.        TEACHING
                        38
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations
and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would
typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies
of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a
smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.                                                      22 / 39

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustra-
tion for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

 In Germany the use of works for teaching purposes is regulated in Secs. 52a, 52b, 53(3) of
 the Copyright Act (UrhG). The provisions read as follows:

           “Section 52a
           Making works available to the public for instruction and research
           (1) It shall be permissible for:
               1. published small, limited parts of a work, small scale works, as well as individu-
                   al articles from newspapers or periodicals for illustration in teaching at
                   schools, universities, non-commercial institutions of education and further ed-
                   ucation, and at vocational training institutions, exclusively for the specifically
                   limited circle of those taking part in the instruction, or
               2. published limited parts of a work, small scale works, as well as individual arti-
                   cles from newspapers or periodicals exclusively for a specifically limited circle
                   of persons for their personal scientific research to be made available to the
                   public, to the extent that this is necessary for the respective purpose and is
                   justified for the pursuit of non-commercial aims.

           (2) Making a work intended for use in instruction in schools available to the public
           shall in all cases be permissible only with the consent of the copyright owner. Mak-
           ing a cinematographic work available to the public, in the territory to which this Act
           applies, before the expiration of two years from the beginning of normal regular utili-
           sation in film theatres, shall in all cases be permissible only with the consent of the
           rightholder.

           (3) It shall be permissible, in the cases referred to in paragraph (1), to produce copies
           also needed for making the work available to the public.”




                                                                                                          23 / 39
           “(4) An equitable remuneration shall be paid for making works available to the public
           in accordance with paragraph (1). Claims may only be asserted through a collecting
           society.

           Section 52b
           Communication of works at terminals in public libraries, museums and archives
           So far as there are no contractual provisions to the contrary, it shall be permissible
           to make published works available from the stocks of publicly accessible libraries,
           museums or archives, which neither directly nor indirectly serve economic or com-
           mercial purposes, exclusively on the premises of the relevant institution at terminals
           dedicated to the purpose of research and for private study. In principle, reproduction
           of a work in excess of the number stocked by the institution shall not be made simul-
           taneously available at such terminals. Equitable remuneration shall be paid in con-
           sideration of their being made available. The claim may only be asserted by a collect-
           ing society.

           Section 53
           Reproduction for private and other personal uses […]
           (3) It shall be permissible to make copies for personal use of small parts of a work, of
           small-scale works or of individual articles released in newspapers or periodicals or
           made available to the public
           1. for the purpose of illustration for teaching in schools, in non-commercial training
           and further training institutions, as well as vocational training institutions in quanti-
           ties required for the persons receiving instruction, or
           2. for state examinations and examinations in schools, higher education institutions,
           non-commercial training and further training institutions, as well as vocational train-
           ing institutions in the required quantity,
           or to have these copies made if and insofar as reproduction is necessary for this
           purpose. The reproduction of a work intended for instructional use at schools shall
           be permissible only in cases where the person entitled has given his consent.”

 The use regulated in the above provisions definitely has to be subject to remuneration.

C.         RESEARCH
                           39
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws
a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this (op-
tional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.


39                                                                                                      24 / 39

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for re-
search purposes? How successful are they?

     Non-commercial use for research purposes is regulated in Sec. 53(2)(1), which reads as fol-
     lows:

            “(2) It shall be permissible to make single copies of a work or to have these made
            1. for one's own scientific use if and to the extent that such reproduction is necessary
            for the purpose and it does not serve a commercial purpose.”


     This provision has proved its worth. In addition, the following provision was introduced into
     Sec. 38(4) of the German Copyright Act (UrhG) through legislation dated 1 October 2013:

            “The author of an academic or research article written within the context of research
            work that was funded to an extent of at least 50% by public funds, which was pub-
            lished in a collection published periodically at least twice per year, is entitled, even if
            he has granted an exclusive licence to the publisher or editor, to make the article
            available to the public 12 months after its initial publication, in the accepted manu-
            script version provided this does not serve a commercial purpose. The source of ini-
            tial publication shall be indicated. Any divergent agreement to the detriment of the au-
            thor shall be invalid.”

     The intention is to enable academics and researchers to publish their research articles that
     were supported by public funds elsewhere after 12 months at the most. Agreements to the
     contrary are invalid. This provision still has to prove its worth.




D.         DISABILITIES
                           40
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability.
The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of


40                                                                                                         25 / 39

works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works
                                                                                           41
published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) .
                        42
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are
blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copy-
right that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format
copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member
States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions
at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.     (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons
with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across
borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:] Have you
experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special formats
across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of
works published in special formats, including across borders?

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
     The use of works by disabled persons is regulated in Sec. 45a of the German Copyright Act
     (UrhG), which reads as follows:

           “(1) The reproduction of a work for non-commercial purposes shall be permissible
           for, and its distribution exclusively to, persons whose access to the work, because of
           a disability, is not possible or is made considerably more difficult by the already
           available means of sensual perception, if such reproduction is necessary to facilitate
           access.
           (2) An equitable remuneration shall be paid to the author for reproduction and distri-
           bution; production solely of individual copies shall be exempted. Claims may only be
           asserted through a collecting society.“


     It appears that this provision has proved its worth.

E.       TEXT AND DATA MINING
                                                       43
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly
important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing
texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other auto-
mated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, pat-
terns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through
subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is
made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories
or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine
protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders
for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for tempo-
rary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities
should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and
data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways.
Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and re-
late rather to the need to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data
mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of “Li-
                   44
cences for Europe” . In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional
licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscrip-
tion agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced,
possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experi-
enced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods, including
across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copy-
right, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across bor-

the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across
borders?

 In this respect no problems have arisen under copyright law in Germany so far. Evidently,
 voluntary solutions are functioning.

F.      USER-GENERATED CONTENT
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little
to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including
the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally original content, they
can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result
                                           45
on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs . User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modifica-
tion of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a
creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the
scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the pos-
sibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions
with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe"
stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the
problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of
views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a
new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available
(licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders
                                                                             46
across different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions .



45
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Numerous different interests are affected where user-generated content (UGC) is concerned.


Private use is usually also public, since UGC is placed on the internet and as a rule every pri-
vate website can be accessed throughout the world. Hence the matter does not concern private
use, but, rather, matters (reproduction, making available to the public, etc.) that are of rele-
vance under copyright law. This applies all the more so where commercial purposes are pur-
sued. This therefore affects all those who make works accessible to final consumers or who
participate in this process, especially platform operators, the reason being that even if the ser-
vices offered by such platforms are used by private persons, the platform operators are all
acting commercially. They should be under an obligation to obtain the requisite rights from the
collective rights management organisations or other right holders if the non-commercial users
of the commercial platform fail to do so (and the platform operator’s business model does not
provide for such acquisition of rights by users).


Apart from this, the term “UGC” should not extend to contents simply used under its guise in
unchanged form and without the right holder’s consent. Where works of third parties are used
in unchanged form, the relevant rights of use have to be acquired.


Where works are used in modified form, the author’s moral rights have to be observed. As a
rule the corresponding adaptation rights will have to be acquired from the right holders.


This situation could change where third-party works only serve as stimulation for one’s own
creative activities. However, in this case the user may not appropriate the third-party work in
whole or in part, but may only glean stimulation from it in order to create something independ-
ent and individual him- or herself. The independent nature of the work has to cause the work
used as stimulation to pale in the shade of the newly created work.

     III.   Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or
                                                                                          47
limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying . Levies are
charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers,
etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without
their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private
use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for
rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of
files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an
MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially
lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’
            4849
licence fees .
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-
based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
                                              50
private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
There is no need to amend Art. 5(2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29/EC. In particular, it is im-
portant to continue to ensure that corresponding limitations are permitted only if fair compen-
sation is secured for right holders.
     NO OPINION
65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is min-
                                            51
imal, be subject to private copying levies?
     YES – Please explain
This question was answered by the ECJ in the VG Wort proceedings (C-457/11 – C-460/11).
Where a Member State has excluded any right for the right holders to authorise reproduction of
their protected works or other subject-matter, pursuant to a provision in Article 5(2) and (3) of
Directive 2001/29, then any authorising act the right holders may adopt is devoid of legal ef-
fects, has no effect on the harm caused to right holders and therefore has no bearing on the
fair compensation owed (para. 37). In Germany reproductions for private and other personal
use are permitted under Sec. 53(1)-(3) of the Copyright Act (UrhG) without the consent of right
holders being required. This means that such copies only have to be taken into account within
the context of the levy on equipment and storage media; payments made in connection with
contractual licences do not play a role.

mediation on private copying and reprography levies
66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


The levy on equipment and storage media is also payable where copyrighted works are repro-
duced in connection with online services (e.g. cloud computing). This is the case, for example,
where works are downloaded from a cloud portal and stored on a computer or storage device.
It is also important to examine whether, in view of the increasing use of cloud services by way
of streaming, where there is often no permanent storage, new remuneration options should be
introduced for right holders.


Notwithstanding these issues, the number of persons permitted to download or stream con-
tents placed on a cloud portal should be limited in order to prevent the risk of contents being
made available to the public under the pretence of a large circle of friends, e.g. in social net-
works or by cyberlocker services.


Just as private copies are permitted as “individual” copies according to the German under-
standing pursuant to Sec. 53(1) of the Copyright Act, the individual copies uploaded to a cloud
portal (or cyberlocker) should only be able to be used, i.e. especially downloaded (or
streamed), by “individuals” (i.e. by a strictly limited number of persons). More extensive use
should fall within the ambit of the exclusive right.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles
to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member
States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irre-
spective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business).
In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
                                                                                  53
which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments .

In Germany the reimbursement of levies on equipment and storage media in connection with
export transactions is generally handled unproblematically by the competent collective rights
management society. Irrespective of this it would be important to examine specifically whether
it makes sense to establish a central bureau at the European level in order to handle such re-
imbursements on a European scale.

69.    What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result
in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of
transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
In Germany there are limitations on the reproduction right not only on the basis of Art. 5(2)(b)
of Directive 2001/29, but also under Art. 5(2)(a),(c) and Art. 5(3) of the same Directive (see Sec.
53(1)-(3) of the German Copyright Act). Such reproductions are all subject to remuneration and
covered by the system of levies on equipment and storage media. Hence a levy on equipment
and storage media is payable where products are sold to private persons and within the field of
education, academia and research as well as commerce. However, the amount of the levy can
still vary in the different areas. The decisive aspect here is the scope in which reproductions
allowed by law are made. Where reproductions are made by certain devices (e.g. photocopying
devices, multi-function devices, printers, scanners and fax machines), the use of texts and
images for private purposes and other private use is permitted accordingly; for these devices a
uniform levy for all fields is therefore the only appropriate solution. Where other devices (e.g.
computers) are concerned, it is possible that lawful use in the private sphere will predominate;
for this reason different levy rates for the public and commercial spheres might be necessary.


70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what ex-
    tent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
    Member States help to remedy the situation?


Please see answer to Question 69. Insofar as different levy rates are provided for certain areas
(e.g. private persons and enterprises), it should be possible for the party liable for the levy to
pay the relevant – lower – rate from the outset or to be able to claim ex post reimbursement.
Ideally, such systems should be agreed on a collective basis between the collective rights
management organisations and the associations of parties liable for the levy.




71.   If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system,
how would these problems best be solved?


The system of levies on equipment and storage media has long since proven its worth and has
to be upheld during the digital age. It ensures fair compensation for authors and other right         33 / 39
holders with regard to mass reproductions which cannot be compensated otherwise. Where
difficulties arise in practice, solutions should be sought primarily at the national level. This
applies especially to the question of how compensation can be fixed and claimed rapidly and
effectively. However, as mentioned above, it is important to examine the extent to which a cen-
tral European bureau could facilitate the processing where export transactions are concerned.



      IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in
the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are
few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to
          54
producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is
                                                    55
created in the context of an employment contract . This is an area that has been traditionally left for
Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial
differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in par-
ticular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new
forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised
issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-
out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion
that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is neces-
sary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination
of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of
your works and performances?
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A distinction has to be made in this respect.

Where works are used within the confines of statutory limitations, as a rule statutory claims for
remuneration should be provided for, which can only be exercised and disbursed to authors
and right holders through the collective rights management organisations. This is necessary
so that authors’ shares are not contracted out. For this reason these claims should not be sub-
ject to a waiver and should be transferable to a collective rights management society alone.
However, in connection with the provisions on collective rights management organisations, it
would be important to ensure that the adequate remuneration actually flows to authors and
right holders.


Where works are not used within the confines of statutory limitations, but, rather the rights
granted to exploiting entities, a copyright contract law would have to be laid down. This copy-
right contract law should provide for a principle of participation according to which adequate
remuneration is payable to authors for each and every use of their works.


Reference is made to the example of Secs. 31-44 of the German Copyright Act (UrhG).


A tried and tested means of ensuring adequate remuneration for authors and performing art-
ists on the basis of their exclusive rights is the model laid down in Art. 4 of the European Rent-
al Directive (Art. 5 of the consolidated version of 2006). According to the provision, an author
or performing artists retains by law a claim for adequate remuneration, which cannot be
waived, after having transferred or assigned his or her exclusive right to the producer. This
model that is restricted to the rental right in the Directive could also be applied to other rights

54
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
55                                                                                                             34 / 39
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.
and in relation to other exploiting entities, as provided for under German law with regard to the
cable retransmission right. This claim for adequate remuneration should ideally be made by
the collective rights management organisations alone, as is the case in Germany. The claim
should apply primarily in relation to users of the exclusive right (e.g. the party renting out), and
in relation to the exploiting entity (e.g. the producer).

73.     Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in con-
tracts)?
     YES – Please explain
Authors usually have to grant their rights for the duration of the term of protection, i.e. without
any limitation in time. This can be acceptable where they participate regularly in the proceeds
of the use made of their works. Often, however, non-recurrent lump sums are paid. This is in-
compatible with a grant of rights that is not limited in time. For this reason rights should only
be able to be granted for a certain period of time, with an option to extend that period by a fur-
ther defined period, several times if necessary, subject to payment of a corresponding remu-
neration. The provision has to be drawn up so as to guarantee a remuneration for the author if
the term is extended.

     NO – Please explain why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to ad-
dress the shortcomings you identify?
It is generally recognized that in contractual negotiations the author is as a rule the weaker
party in relation to the party seeking to exploit his or her works. Frequently the author is com-
pelled to sign pre-worded model contracts without having an opportunity to agree on divergent
provisions. It is not unusual for such model contracts to include clauses (standard terms and
conditions) under which the exploiting entities obtain the transfer of all rights imaginable,
without paying adequate remuneration to the author for all these uses. Hence there has to be
control over such contractual clauses. Since the authors are generally not in a position eco-
nomically or tactically (they will never again be given a job if they sue their contracting part-
ners) to enforce their claims against the exploiting entities, authors’ associations must be
permitted to have such clauses reviewed by the courts.

     V.     Respect for rights
                      56
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual
property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this

56
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement   35 / 39
of intellectual property rights.
     57
text . Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper
respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient
to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the
other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the
protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement
of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed con-
                                        58
tent is used for a commercial purpose . One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermedi-
                              59
aries in the IP infrastructure . At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for re-
spect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringe-
ments of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Better protection has to start with the regulation of acts of use in copyright, an infringement of
which can then be prosecuted under civil law. However, as regards the enforcement of rights
under civil law, the principle should be set out that in case of a copyright infringement at least
double the license fee is payable as damages.


     NO OPINION

76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient in-
volvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements
with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?
[Open question]
Yes, in our view the current legal framework for involving intermediaries (agents and brokers)
is satisfactory. However, we do not understand why Question 76 relates to “infringements with
a commercial purpose”. Intermediaries, especially host providers, transport specifically in-
fringements of a private nature, which as a rule however are made available to the public via
commercial intermediaries. This is possibly what is meant in Question 76.

In particular, the liability of intermediaries for injunctions and removal in Art. 8(3) of Directive
on Copyright in the Information Society is a good example. The approach taken in Art. 8(3) of
that Directive, that intermediaries can be sued for injunctive relief and removal if appropriate,
irrespective of their own responsibility, offers a sufficiently flexible system for the courts in
order to shape appropriate solutions in the area of liability for injunctions and removal. As re-
gards hosting providers in particular, there is extensive case law at both the ECJ level and the
national level which provides a reasonable balance between the interests involved on both
sides (see most recently ECJ case C-324/09 – L’Orèal v eBay; decision of the German Federal
Court of Justice (BGH), GRUR 2013, 1030 – File-Hosting-Dienst). As regards access providers,
the ECJ is currently drawing up the relevant guidelines in accordance with Art. 8(3) of the Di-
rective on Copyright in the Information Society (C-314/12; judgment expected in Spring 2014).
Although the question whether advertisers and financial services providers have to be consid-
ered intermediaries in the sense of Art. 8(3) of the Directive on Copyright in the Information
Society, one may expect a fitting solution to be found in case law.

57
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by Directive   36 / 39
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
In the area of liability for damages on the part of intermediaries, fundamental harmonisation
took place under the Enforcement Directive 2004/48. It unfortunately emerged recently that – at
least in the view of the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) – an important element is still
lacking, namely harmonization of the regulations on liability, especially on the liability of of-
fenders and participants. According to the more recent case law of the German Federal Court
of Justice (BGH), this question is left to national law (decision of the German Federal Court of
Justice (BGH), GRUR 2013, 1229 paras. 30, 62 - Kinderhochstühle im Internet II). This exposes
intermediaries not only to the risk of claims for damages being filed in various EU Member
States in different ways. In our view a purely national solution seems to conflict with the har-
monization of the exemptions from liability set out in Arts. 12-14 of the E-Commerce Directive
2000/31. However, as regards claims for damages we believe that the case law of the ECJ in
particular will provide a fitting solution to this problem.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?
   YES – Please explain
A person who uses works of a third party unlawfully has to accept that action will be taken
against him and that his personal data will be required for this purpose.
In our view it is the responsibility of the courts to establish a reasonable balance. So far the
courts have met this responsibility without difficulty. We refer especially to the case law of the
ECJ, which in several more recent decisions has paid close attention to striking a “fair bal-
ance” between the fundamental rights involved on both sides, especially between constitu-
tionally guaranteed authors’ rights, data privacy protection rights and the right to an enterprise
(see for example decision of the ECJ case C-275/06 para. 68 - Promusicae; C-360/10 para. 46 et
seq. - SABAM/Netlog; C-70/10 para. 40 et seq. - Scarlet/SABAM).

        VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite
some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A
unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace
national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see
this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be en-
sured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher
level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’
legal systems.




78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as
well as a single framework for enforcement?
   YES

79.     Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the cur-
rent level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term pro-
ject?
[Open question]

Questions 78 and 79 can only be answered as open questions.

As an objective, a uniform European copyright law might make sense, however not at any
price. The high level of protection emphasized so far in the Directives has to continue to be
aimed at and ensured. This is only possible if the principle of the creator is upheld. The author
as a natural person who can create individual works is the focus of attention. His or her imma-
terial interests have to be safeguarded through the provisions on the author’s moral rights. His
or her pecuniary interests have to be safeguarded by an adequate copyright contract law
among other things. This also applies to employees’ copyrights.

The first thing to do is to consider combining and harmonizing the existing Directives. In this
respect a uniform meaning of the term “work” should also be defined.

So far there are some elementary differences between national copyright laws, especially
where they are usually identified as the continental-European system of authors’ rights and the
Anglo-Saxon copyright system. Harmonisation only makes sense if the above-mentioned ob-
jectives (principle of the creator, author’s moral rights and copyright contract law) are aimed at
at a high level.


   VII.    Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important matters relat-
ing to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important matters have been omitted, we
would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

In view of the increasing number of cases on copyright matters that are referred to the ECJ,
special jurisdiction for copyright disputes should be established at the ECJ.

A problem has arisen with the existing regulation of databases, especially where official data-
bases are concerned. Here, harmonization of the limitations on copyright and on related rights
would be required. In detail:

A particular problem arises where official databases are concerned: the works stored in such
databases can be in the public domain as so-called official works under the law of a Member
State. However, what is not clear is whether an official database can also be in the public do-
main although it satisfies the requirements for protection of the database maker. It would be
desirable for the same legal treatment to be afforded to official works and official databases.
Databases are often established and maintained in the official interest by public bodies. There
can be an official interest in enabling use of such a database not only in that members of the
general public can obtain specific information from it, but that everybody is permitted – unim-
paired by a right accruing to the database maker – to extract significant segments from the
database and to incorporate them into other databases. This can be the case where there is a
specific official interest in the existence of not only the official database as a general source of
information, but in the data stored being retrievable from other databases (e.g. where official
databases contain information on the rapid treatment of acute poisoning incidents, on travel
warnings, vaccination recommendations or missing persons search announcements following                       38 / 39
catastrophes, in databases containing court judgments or sources of law). Hence it can be in
the public interest for private enterprises to be authorized to trawl through official databases
regularly, including those in other Member States, searching for changes in the data stored,
and to incorporate newly added data into their own databases (possibly after having translated
the information).

The Database Directive does not expressly regulate the question of whether and the extent to
which the Member States may stipulate in their national laws that a database satisfying the re-
quirements of the sui generis protection can be in the public domain as an “official database” if it
is made publicly accessible in the official interest of public knowledge. The question whether the
Database Directive nevertheless permits such a restriction on the right accruing to the database
maker is disputed, likewise the question whether this would be advisable (see on the standpoints

In the case “Sächsischer Ausschreibungsdienst” (judgment of 28 September 2006 – Case No. I
ZR 261/03, GRUR 2007, 500 = GRUR Int. 2007, 532), in a referral seeking a preliminary ruling,
the German Federal Court of Justice asked the ECJ whether the Database Directive prevents a
national provision according to which an official database published owing to the official inter-
est in public knowledge does not enjoy sui generis protection in the sense of the Directive. The
ECJ did not hand down a ruling on this question (see ECJ notification of 25 June 2008, C-
215/07, Celex-Nr. 6200700215C(02)). Regulation of this question for the EU as a whole would be
beneficial in the interest of legal certainty, also in the area of the international exchange of da-
ta.

Generally, one might consider a harmonised regulation of the principles of copyright contract
law, including copyright law relating to employees.

According to Art. 4(1) of the Directive 2001/29 on Copyright in the Information Society, authors
have the exclusive right, in respect of the original of their works or copies thereof, to authorize
or prohibit distribution thereof to the public in any form through sale or otherwise. In its judg-
ment of 17 April 2008 in the case “Le Corbusier Möbel”, the ECJ did not interpret the phrase
“any form of distribution to the public by sale or otherwise”, but, rather based its judgment
solely on Art. 6(1) WCT and required the transfer of ownership for distribution. In doing so the
Court overlooked the fact that Art. 6 WCT only sets out minimum rights, not maximum rights.
Hence the ECJ was not prevented from interpreting Art. 4(1) of the Directive on Copyright in
the Information Society and to interpret any form of distribution to the public by sale or other-
wise as being the transfer of possession as well. It would be important to clarify whether Art.
4(1) can also be understood in this sense.
