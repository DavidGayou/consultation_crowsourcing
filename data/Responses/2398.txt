     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

    III.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

AIE, as a collective management society administering performers’ intellectual property
rights, is entitled to manage remuneration rights, not exclusive rights and therefore is not
requested to grant multi-territorial licences.
Cross-border payments are achieved in this context by way of bilateral agreements with the
sister collecting societies of other territories, which in their turn grant the relevant
authorizations for the use of the national and international repertoire in the scope of their
territory.
This is in line with the principle of territoriality set up by the EU “acquis” and ratified by the
ECJ in several judgments.
We must enhance that the system of bilateral agreements and the territoriality principle have
been a positive combination to ensure the cross-border remuneration of the rights and the
enforcement of such rights at national level.
In our view, this scheme should be one of the basis for the harmonization of the making
available right for performers in the EU scope, as it will be explained in the answers to the
subsequent questions.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-

services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
    YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X    NO – Please explain
No. AIE thinks that deep legislative measures are not needed in relation to the cross-
border availability of content services. As we pointed out in Question 3, we should make
a difference between exclusive and remuneration rights when talking about “cross-
border availability”.

Many European performers find it hard to protect their right over online works. The European
Union established the making available right as an exclusive right for performers who,
obviously, grant this right in favor of producers, losing the control of their work. In
connection with the latter, AIE supports the establishment of an unwaivable right to equitable
remuneration when the making available on demand right is transferred to the producer, that
would be managed by the performers’ collective management organizations (CMO’s).

A similar configuration of the right is working in Spain: the making available on demand is an
exclusive right for audio and audiovisual performers (included in the law as a specialty of the
communication to the public) which is presumably assigned to the producer, without
prejudice to the unwaivable right to equitable remuneration granted by the law to be paid from
the person who makes available the subject-matter. It is a right collectively managed by the
performers’ CMO’s. .

In AIE view, not only the European Union would achieve a better protection on the online
content, but it would also achieve homogenization and harmonization as a first step to reach a
“cross-border availability” of content and the protection of intellectual property rights. In
practice, the effect of such regulation is the effective protection of performers in the digital
environment regardless of a possible (probable) transfer of their right in favor of a producer.

Development of innovative digital cultural content is in a great extent important. However,
the European Union should be very careful in every step it takes regarding digital content
since, as we have already expressed, digital content must be promoted as long as the proper
instruments of protection are provided to right holders because on the contrary such
development could be detrimental to the legitimate creators’ rights. We are witnessing at
present that performers are not fairly remunerated for the use of their performances in the
online environment, and such unbalanced situation should be corrected, since the loss of the
making available on demand right, once transferred to the producer implies that they are no
longer paid for use of their performances in the digital scope, although the producer continues
to obtain the incomes of such exploitation,



                                                                                             10
The making available right is the main right that right holders have to protect their
works/performances in the online environment.

If the EU establishes then the making available right for performers as a remuneration right
that survives despite the transfer in favor of producers the unbalanced treatment that
performers are bearing at present would be corrected. This is in our view the proper way to
develop digital cultural content on-line and harmonizing the legal framework.
     NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               11
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
X NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
No, the scope is not sufficiently clear.

Firstly, AIE, as an AEPO ARTIS member, refers to the answers made by this organization to
this question 8 on the analysis and clarification of the rights involved in cross-border
situations,

Secondly, in our view the Commission should take the opportunity of the present revision of
the “acquis” to strengthen the making available right for performers, which has been
established at first by the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) in the
international scope in 1996 and then by the 2001/29 Copyright Directive at EU level.
Whereas 15 of the Copyright Directive states “Those Treaties update the international
protection for copyright and related rights significantly, not least with regard to the so-called
‘digital agenda’… The Community and a majority of Member States have already signed the
Treaties and the process of making arrangements for the ratification of the Treaties by the
Community and the Member States is under way. This Directive also serves to implement a
number of the new international obligations.”

Among these new international obligations a new right for producers and performers was
included in the WPPT: the making available right of their phonograms (for producers) and of
their performances (for performers) fixed in phonograms, by wire or wireless means, in such a
way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually
chosen by them.




22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                              12
Such right is the most significant right for performers at present, altogether with the right to
remuneration for the communication to the public that is included in article 15 of the WPPT
and in article 8 of the Directive 2006/115/EC for performers, which prominence is growing in
the online environment, under the form of digital transmissions.

The increasing importance of the making available right is due to the prosperity of new
business models in the Internet, based in the use of cultural contents. It affects performers, as
they lose control over their works in the moment they sign a contract with a producer and, at
the same time, their performances are widely spread in the digital scope without a fair
remuneration for such use.

Moreover, it must be considered that the making available right is replacing in the online
environment the rental right of the offline environment, through the new business models,
especially in the audiovisual scope; take into account that the former video stores such as
“Blockbuster” where consumers rented the movies to be watched at home are being replaced
by video stores on line, such as “Wuaki tv” or “Netflix”, which allow consumers the same
kind of rental for home entertainment.

The rental right provided by Directive 2006/115/EC (in the original text of the Directive
92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992) states in article 4:

“1.Where an author or performer has transferred or assigned his rental right concerning a
phonogram or an original or copy of a film to a phonogram or film producer, that author or
performer shall retain the right to obtain an equitable remuneration for the rental.
2. The right to obtain an equitable remuneration for rental cannot be waived by authors or
performers.”

Besides, article 2 of the same Directive sets up:

“5. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, when a contract concerning film production is
concluded, individually or collectively, by performers with a film producer, the performer
covered by this contract shall be presumed, subject to contractual clauses to the contrary, to
have transferred his rental right, subject to Article 4.
7. Member States may provide that the signing of a contract concluded between a performer
and a film producer concerning the production of a film has the effect of authorizing rental,
provided that such contract provides for an equitable remuneration within the meaning of
Article 4”

This Directive provided legal grounds for a remuneration right for the rental. It was in
practice granted to audiovisual performers, but it could have been extended to the audio
performers. What it has to be considered in AIE view is that under the Rental Directive the
performers did not lose their rights because a new form of exploitation: the rental and on the
contrary under the Infosoc Directive they are losing in fact the making available right, under
new online exploitation forms, equivalent to the rental, as explained above.

In our opinion, such unfair situation must be revised, since this is another reason to grant a
remuneration right for performers for the making available right.




                                                                                              13
This is why the EU should harmonize the regulation of this right under the form of a
remuneration right for making their performances available to the public, as explained in the
answer to question 7, since in that way fairness in the compensation for the use of the contents
and uniformity in the regulation would be achieved



Referring to the remuneration right explained in question 7, we must underline that in Spain
not only Spanish performers are granted with such right but also European and international
performers. Provided that this system is extrapolated to the rest of member States, possible
“cross borders problems” would disappear. Moreover, the current system of reciprocity
agreements between collective management societies ensures that users can have access to a
world-wide repertoire while performers from all over the European Union are fairly
remunerated no matter the territory in which the exploitation acts took place. This system has
worked properly in relation to the public communication remuneration right (established by
both international treaties and EU Law). Besides, a system based on a remuneration right
would be consistent with the recent International Law: the 2012 WIPO Beijing Treaty
foresees the possibility to establish a making available remuneration right. Article 12 of this
treaty lays down as follows: “Independent of the transfer of exclusive rights described above,
national laws or individual, collective or other agreements may provide the performer with
the right to receive royalties or equitable remuneration for any use of the performance, as
provided for under this Treaty including as regards Articles 10 and 11” (article 10 is the one
related to the making available right).

From a practical point of view, we point out some data about how the making available right
form performers has worked in Spain:

   -   2006: IP law on making available right enacted.
   -   2007: AIE starts negotiation with main market operators and representative
       associations in the sector.
   -   2008-2009: First lawsuits given the difficulties to make the right effective.
       Negotiations kept on with other users
   -   2010-2011: first agreements with telephone companies and Internet radios
   -   2012: Agreement with Internet platform for making available on demand uses and
       other telephone company (led by the lawsuit started in 2008). First distribution of
       remuneration collected for 2010 and 2011.

AIE had some difficulties in the implementation, because users were reluctant to the
agreements and payments, but through the intervention of the Courts the right has been legally
consolidated and today the collection and distribution to performers is a reality.

Thirdly and coming back to the remuneration right for the communication to the public,
included in article 15 of the WPPT and in article 8 of the Directive 2006/115/EC for
performers, we must underline that there are many occasions when the “digital transmissions”
are related to the communication to the public and not to the making available right: namely
the cases of simulcasting/non interactive webcasting. Therefore such cases and business
models fall under the scope of a right that is already harmonized in the EU under the
mentioned Directive, which sets up a legal framework for cross border exchanges in the
Internal Market that should be respected by all the stakeholders.


                                                                                             14
It should be enhanced also that the Directive 2001/29/EC does not provide for a
communication to the public right for performers (unlike in authors case) since it was already
foreseen in Directive 2006/115/EC, which is the applicable one in the digital scope.

It appears there are some interested stakeholders -individual producers/majors- who want to
license all internet services individually. This purpose is aimed to subvert the nature of certain
acts of exploitation of phonograms which contain artistic performances, such as “non-
interactive webcasting” services. These record companies precisely try to exclude them from
being deemed as public communication acts and transfer such services to the scope of the
making available right, licensed by the producer.

It implies that services that are broadly attached to the right of digital communication to the
public at European level and in general internationally, may not be administered by Producers
Collective Management organizations (CMO’s) and it will also affect Performers’ CMO’s
who by mandate of article 12 of the Rome Convention of 1961 negotiate jointly with
Producers CMO’s the rates with the users for the right of communication to the public in
general. Finally, if this individual producers/majors plan progresses the producers and
performers unity of action will be broken for the first time since the Rome Convention.

In AIE view the latter violates the 1961 Rome Convention, the 1996 WPPT and European
legislation, since communication to the public and making available on demand are distinct
rights.

AIE supports a “country of reception principle” as the best system to administer the making
available acts. More details on this topic are included in answers to question 9.
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
X     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
Yes. Setting up the country of reception approach and harmonizing the making
available right for performers as a remuneration right would be the correct way to
address the question of territoriality.
The country of reception principle would be the most appropriate for a practical application of
the right, for the services that intend to exploit the creative contents in different member states
in the online environment and it also would prevent “forum shopping” which could take place
under a country of origin approach to find the most favourable regime.
For performers the application of the country of reception should be linked to a harmonization
of the making available right in the form explained in question 8, i.e., as a remuneration right,
because if the current system of an exclusive right transferable to the producer is kept in most
of the countries, the application either of the country of origin or the country of reception

24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 15

the systems.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X     NO
No. We do not think it is a problem. Regardless of the existence of a reproduction act, or
not, in a download process, we must keep in mind that the essential right involved in this
act is the making available right. Therefore, this right should be strengthened and the
way of granting a remuneration right for it in line with our explanations in answers to
question 8 and we should focus on it.
Moreover, in the case of performers, they usually transfer the exclusive reproduction right to
the producer. Consequently, they do not obtain remuneration for these acts of reproduction
once the exclusive right has been transferred (notwithstanding the compensation for the
private copying reproductions, when appropriate).

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'

memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
Yes. In our view, the provision of a hyperlink to works shall be deemed as a making
available act regardless of the place in which the content is stored. A service provider
that provides hyperlinks to works is clearly making works available “in such a way that
members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them” (art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
Even national legislations and case law are tending to lay down expressly hyperlinks in the
intellectual property laws. For example, both the Spanish legislative project amending the
current Intellectual Property Law and the project amending the criminal Code foresee the
provision of systematic lists of hyperlinks as an infringement and a crime respectively.
As to the pending preliminary rulings before the ECJ, (C-466/12, the Svensson case) has
already been resolved by the ECJ.
In that case, although the Court rules there is no act of communication to the public in the
particular act considered, it does not mean that the provision of a clickable link to subject-
matter could constitute an act of communication to the public/making available to the public
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. In other cases, where the conditions stated in
the judgement are met, namely when it is addressed to a new public who was not taken into
consideration.
Regarding the C-279/1, Bestwater International, we must wait to the pending judgment of the
Court.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache

In any case, AIE thinks that it is not a priority problem, specially bearing in mind that there is
a pending preliminary rule before the ECJ on this issue (C-360/13: Public Relations
Consultants Association Limited v The Newspaper Licensing Agency Limited and others).
The cornerstone of the act referred in the question is the making available act involved.
Whether the viewing of a work on the screen is made by means of a streaming or
downloading act, it always implies a making available/public communication act.
Besides the already existing exceptions of article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive (2001/29) set
up the boundaries of the temporary reproduction, and accordingly only acts which don’t have
independent economic significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right; others
qualify then for a payment.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

licensing of works and other subject matter?

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
AIE is a member of SCAPR, the Societies' Council for the Collective Management of
Performers' Rights and SCAPR participates in ISNI (International Standard Numbering
Identifier). AIE supports the following answer made by ISNI to the consultation:


The role of metadata in the development of ‘machine-mediated’ transaction processing has
long been recognised and there is in place a foundational body of work – including work
supported by the European Commission – which provides context and principles for
consideration of the interoperability of identifiers (Rust 2000, Paskin 2013).


Identification is concerned with the denoting of particular entities and an item of metadata is a
relationship that is claimed to exist between two entities (Paskin 2003). This encompasses the
concept of identifiers being largely static things with a closely defined specification including
governance, the field of application, policies for assignment and some required infrastructure.

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

      You will find more information about this initiative on the following website:

   You will find more information about this initiative (funded in part by the European Commission) on the

34
   You will find more information about this initiative on the following website: http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

                                                                                                              20
In fact, persistence and stability are important properties of identifiers. This is in contrast with
metadata, which is often highly dynamic. Assertions claimed for relations such as
‘ownership’, ‘rights’, ‘licenses’ and the like are in a constant state of flux as a direct
consequence of commercial activity. The question of the authority of parties to make
assertions is also a factor, especially when the assertions made are found to be in conflict.


There is naturally a need to provide different identifier systems that are specified to identify
different types of things for different purposes. Within the indecs framework the treatment of
content occurs in four different layers:
- abstraction (the work, for example identified by ISWC for musical works)
- expression (a creation that expresses the work, for example identified by ISRC for
recordings)
- manifestation (the embodiment of the expression in an artefact (e.g. identified by UPC/EAN
for physical CDs)
- item (an instance of a thing, for example a particular CD)
Identifiers are also required for other types of entity such as for the public names of
performers (for which ISNI is applicable).


Interoperability is the ability to enable use of information that originates in one context, in a
separate context (Paskin 2003). Identifiers have a special role in this regard since, if different
databases and systems can have a reliable way of denoting or distinguishing the entities under
consideration then it becomes possible to establish machine-mediated transactions that can
utilise the information across different contexts. Across the entire digital music sector, right
holders and other actors utilise internationally standardised identifiers such as ISRC and
ISWC, expressly to provide for interoperable solutions that can span organisations and
territories. Controlled vocabularies – sometimes expressed as data dictionaries - also have a
special role in ensuring that the meaning of terms used within assertions made about the
entities, have an unambiguous meaning across the different contexts.


With regard to industry databases, especially those concerning rights and licensing, there is
much activity within the commercial sphere. There is a constant state of flux shaped for
example by market pressures, deals, internal improvements in data quality, as conflicting
claims become resolved, and as standards evolve and technical capabilities develop.


What can the Commission do? In the immediate future two things:


(1) In cases where the foundational work needs to be put into place the Commission can lead
the way, often working with industry and other stakeholders, as with the Linked Content
Coalition (LCC). As ISNI member, SCAPR supports the valuable work of the Commission
in this area and together with member companies, is participating in this work area.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X      YES – Please explain


Yes, the Directive 2011/77/EU on the extension of term of protection has been a very
positive step on improving the protection for performers on phonograms, but the same
protection has not been granted on audiovisual fixations and this is a pending issue
which should be achieved in the EU.
The extension of the term to 70 years after the first publication for performers on phonograms
approaches the level of protection for EU performers to the one granted in other territories,
(namely the USA and certain Latin American countries), and reduces the term difference
between authors and performers. This allows performers to be remunerated for the
exploitation of their performances fixed in phonograms during 20 additional years, which is a
supplementary income during the last part of their careers.
Besides certain additional provisions included in the Directive improve the rights granted to
performers, such as the “use it or lose it” and the “clean slate” clauses.

As to the 20% be set aside by the phonogram producer for payment of the annual
supplementary remuneration to performers’ its effectiveness will depend on the transposition
of the Directive into the national laws because detailed rules on the provision of information
by the producers to the performers collecting societies should be set up to this aim.

     IV.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
    YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X    NO – Please explain
No. In AIE’s opinion, the current system laid down by Directive 2001/29/EC is an
effective system of exceptions and limitations




The current catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive and
often optional. We think that this system is consistent with the International Treaties, which
the European Union is part of. The spirit of these international instruments is establishing
exceptions in a very restricted way and this restricted way is perfectly established by the so-
called “three-step-test” which is, by the way, laid down by art. 5.5. of Directive 2001/29 (The
exceptions and limitations provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other
subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder).
This restrictive rule governs international treaties as a tool to reduce the scope of exceptions
and, thus, increase the protection in favour of right holders.
Apart from the latter, the “catalogue system” has been usually chosen by international treaties
to regulate limitations and exceptions (see art. 10 and 10 bis of the 1886 Berne Convention,
art. 15 of the 1961 Rome Convention or the entire 2013 Marrakesh Treaty).




border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                          24
To sum up, AIE considers that the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the
EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States is not a problem but the better
solution to avoid unjustified exceptions harming the protection of right holders.
Besides, AIE would like to point out that although exceptions and limitations are optional, if
they are implemented by a Member State they must fulfil the conditions of the said exception.
Accordingly if a private copying exception is granted as a limitation to the reproduction right,
also the fair compensation for rightholders must be set up, taking into account the 3 step test.
This should be in relation to the need for responsive procedures on the Commission’s side, in
order to guarantee the accurate application of such exception. We are witnessing at present
that the complaint filed in 2012 by the relevant Spanish collecting societies (AIE among
them) against Spain for the amendment of the Intellectual Property Law regarding the private
copying exception, remains unsolved, and therefore the damage that such regulation is
causing to rightholders.
    NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
    YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X    NO – Please explain
No. See answer to question 21.
    NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
No. As we stated in question 21, AIE does not think that exceptions should be mandatory. The
present regulation is in accordance to the international treaties, which were adopted by the
European Union and most of Member Estates.

In relation to a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions, we think that it would be
detrimental for right holders and would infringe the spirit of International Law. The current
catalogue of exceptions has been translated to the digital environment by means of the
Directive 2001/29/EC and there is no need to amend the catalogue in any way. The
exceptions system has worked effectively.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
    YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

                                                                                             25
X    NO – Please explain why
No. A possible greater degree of flexibility would lead to legal uncertainty and it would
cause a deep damage for right holders.
In our opinion, flexibility regarding exceptions and limitations would:
    -   Cause legal uncertainty
    -   Harm right holders
    -   Move away from the spirit of international treaties
    -   Provoke territoriality imbalances within the Internal Market.
    -   Infringe the “three step test” laid down in the different international treaties. As
        Mihály Ficsor points out (The Law of the Copyright and the Internet, OXFORD),
        according to this principle, an exception or limitation should be a special case. This
        means that the use to be covered must be specific – precisely and narrowly determined
        – and that no broadly determined cases are acceptable, and also that, as regards its
        objective, it must be “special” en the sense that it must be justifiable by some clear
        public policy consideration […].
    -   Infringe the principles of the EU intellectual property legislation since, as recitals of
        the Directive 2001/29 point out, “any harmonisation of copyright and related rights
        must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to
        intellectual creation. Their protection helps to ensure the maintenance and
        development of creativity in the interests of authors, performers, producers,
        consumers, culture, industry and the public at large. Intellectual property has
        therefore been recognised as an integral part of property” (Recital 9 of Directive
        2001/29).
    -   Furthermore, according to Recital 44 of directive 2001/29, when applying the
        exceptions and limitations provided for in this Directive, they should be exercised in
        accordance with international obligations. Such exceptions and limitations may not be
        applied in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which
        conflicts with the normal exploitation of his work or other subject matter. The
        provision of such exceptions or limitations by Member States should, in particular,
        duly reflect the increased economic impact that such exceptions or limitations may
        have in the context of the new electronic environment. Therefore, the scope of certain
        exceptions or limitations may have to be even more limited when it comes to certain
        new uses of copyright works and other subject matter.
    NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

a problem?
     YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
No. In fact, we do not perceive any problem regarding exceptions. As mentioned in
question 24, a most flexible system would lead to imbalances among Member states. The
exhaustive catalogue system is the better way to avoid unjustified imbalances in the EU.
Besides, we should not forget that there is an international treaty regulating exceptions and
limitations: Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are
Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled.
This Treaty not only provides an exhaustive catalogue of limitations and exceptions but it also
states, through article 11 that in adopting measures necessary to ensure the application of this
Treaty, a Contracting Party may exercise the rights and shall comply with the obligations that
that Contracting Party has under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the WIPO Copyright Treaty […]. After stating so,
this article refers to the three steps test provisions established in these treaties, making clear
that, apart from being and exhaustive catalogue, limitations of or exceptions to the rights can
be only applied in certain special cases, that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the
work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author;
     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main

     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              35
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated




53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

     V.        Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              39
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X     NO – Please explain
No. In AIE’s view, there is no need to amend Directive 2001/29 since the current
wording is able to cover private copying acts in the digital environment.
Obviously, technological developments have led to a change in the way of consuming
protected works. Concerning reproduction acts, it is clear that the digital equipment and
devices are essential. The negative impact is that they allow massive copying of protected
works. It brings a bigger harm to the right holders since the reproduction is massive. The
ways of carrying out private copies are moving from physical devices and equipment to
unphysical services with a great storage capacity.
Therefore, only the materiality of the object on which works are recorded changes.
Nevertheless, copies made through these services continue being private copying acts and,
consequently, a levy must be applied to those services.
First, we must take into account the legal framework that supports the principles that artists
can receive fair compensation and consumers may make private copies legally. Though AIE
thinks that amendments are not needed, in the case that the EU decides to amend the current
system, it should be carried out under the principles established by the Directive 2001/29. In
this sense, Recital 9 of the relevant Directive states that,
“…any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take as a basis a high level of
protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation. Their protection helps to
ensure the maintenance and development of creativity in the interests of authors, performers,
producers, consumers, culture, industry and the public at large. Intellectual property has
therefore been recognised as an integral part of property.”


Recital 10 also establishes that,

   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:

   Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                         40
“…if authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to
receive an appropriate reward for the use of their work, as must producers in order to be able
to finance this work …”


Therefore, the legislation on intellectual property rights shall be built under the keynote of the
principle of high level of protection for right holders, which implies the reception of an
appropriate reward for the use of their work. Concerning private copying, Recital 38 of the
Directive affirms that,
“…Member States should be allowed to provide for an exception or limitation to the
reproduction right for certain types of reproduction of audio, visual and audio-visual
material for private use, accompanied by fair compensation. This may include the
introduction or continuation of remuneration schemes to compensate for the prejudice to
rightholders …”


Note that the above Recital does not specify the nature of the equipment/device where the
private copying is made, so it admits a broad interpretation in order to cover private copies
made through new business models such as cloud computing systems or others.
Certain new business models, such as cloud computing services, allow consumers to
reproduce works on a storage. This constitutes a reproduction by the user to which a private
copying levy should apply. These services shall pay the proper compensation since,
concerning the agent liable for the payment of the private copying compensation, we must
bear in mind that according to the ECJ:
“…it is consistent with the requirements of that ‘fair balance’ to provide that persons who
have digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who, on that basis, in law or in
fact, make that equipment available to private users or provide them with copying services
are the persons liable to finance the fair compensation, inasmuch as they are able to pass
on to private users the actual burden of financing it” (Section 50 of the judgment on the
Padawan Case).


Apart from practical reasons, we think that companies which offer a service able to store
protected works and profit from making this storage able to the public must be liable to pay
private copying levies. These amounts will be , afterwards, passed on to the final consumers
(as it was stated by the ECJ).
According to the EU Law and Case Law, the compensation paid by these services has to be
calculated on certain basis. The ECJ stated that the compensation shall be directly related to
the harm caused to right holders:
“…the ‘fair balance’ between the persons concerned means that fair compensation must be
calculated on the basis of the criterion of the harm caused to authors of protected works by
the introduction of the private copying exception .” (Section 50 of the Judgment on the
Padawan Case)


If we put it into connection with the precedent paragraph, we can conclude that the concept of
fair compensation shall be interpreted uniformly and that the criterion to determine such
compensation is the harm caused to right holders. Taking this into account that new business

                                                                                               41
models, specially cloud computing services, provokes harm to right holder arising from the
reproduction acts carried out without the authorization of them, those must be eligible to pay
compensation according to the ECJ.
This would improve legal certainty and will benefit both right holders and consumers (since
consumers would be conscious about the legality of reproductions made).
Finally, let us remind that under the ECJ case law
“…the fact that equipment or devices are able to make copies is sufficient in itself to justify
the application of the private copying levy, provided that the equipment or devices have been
made available to natural persons as private users” (Section 59 of the Judgment on the
Padawan Case).


New business models are clearly “able to make copies is sufficient in itself to justify the
application of the private copying levy”.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
X          – Please explain
Yes, digital copies must be considered as private copies regardless of the license obtained
by the internet service provider.
We should bear in mind that copies made through an Internet service fall under the scope of
article 5.2 b) of the Infosoc Directive as long as they are reproductions on any medium made
by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly
commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation which takes account
of the application or non-application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 to the
work or subject-matter concerned;


Therefore, we should not make difference depending on a possible license granted to the
service provider. Furthermore, even the ECJ stated that
In the context of an exception or limitation provided for by Article 5(2) or (3) of Directive
2001/29, an act by which a rightholder may have authorised the reproduction of his protected
work or other subject-matter has no bearing on the fair compensation owed, whether it is
provided for on a compulsory or an optional basis under the relevant provision of that
directive (second point of the final rule on the VG Wort case C-457/11).


The latter means that a possible license does not prejudice the proper compensation since, as
the ECJ establishes, where a Member State has decided, pursuant to a provision in Article
5(2) and (3) of Directive 2001/29, to exclude, from the material scope of that provision, any
right for the rightholders to authorise reproduction of their protected works or other subject-
matter, any authorising act the rightholders may adopt is devoid of legal effects under the law

59
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          42
of that State. Consequently, such an act has no effect on the harm caused to the rightholders
due to the introduction of the relevant measure depriving them of that right, and cannot
therefore have any bearing on the fair compensation owed, whether it is provided for on a
compulsory or an optional basis, under the relevant provision of that directive (Section 37 of
the VG Wort Judgment).


Consequently, this judgment does not agree with the Mr Vitorino approach regarding the
exclusion of the private copying compensation whether there is a possible license granted by
rightholders.
To sum up, the fact that private copies are made through digital or analogue mediums is not
relevant in relation to the existence of an act that must be compensated according to art. 5.2 b)
of the directive 2001/29. This is why all the private reproductions made by end users in the
scope of a new business models should involve the payment of a compensation for the harm
suffered by right holders. The harm is not “minimal” in the digital environment.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We stress that on line services already affect the application of levies in their present
configuration. That said, it is clear that a study on new business models, such as cloud
computing, must be undertaken since different rights are exercised under the frame of the new
business models. One of these is the reproduction right, which puts at stake the private
copying exception; in other words, these business models should be expressly included in the
framework of the private copying exception, for certain acts of exploitation.
Nevertheless, let us remind the legal grounds of the application of private copying to the
devices:
As we already stated in question 64, let us remind that under the ECJ case law
“…the fact that equipment or devices are able to make copies is sufficient in itself to justify
the application of the private copying levy, provided that the equipment or devices have been
made available to natural persons as private users”.(Section 69 of the Padawan Judgment)


So storage systems in new business models are clearly “able to make copies” and then “is
sufficient in itself to justify the application of the private copying levy”.
The fact that new business models have led to a change in the way of reproducing works or
other subject-matter has nothing to do with the existence or not of a private copying act
according to the wording of article 5.2 b) of the directive and the ECJ case law.

                                                                                              43
The establishment of an exception for private copying has to involve a proper compensation
for the harm suffered. It is a criterion consistent with the International Law, EU Law and ECJ
case law.
Specifically, cloud computing services allow end users to carry out private reproductions so
these services should be eligible to pay the relevant compensation. This way, end users would
know that the act they are carrying out is perfectly in accordance to law.
In that sense we must quote the Report on private copying levies of the Committee on Legal
Affairs of the Parliament (Rapporteur: Françoise Castex) which has been adopted in the
plenary.
Such Report supports that “private copying exception arrangements should apply to certain
online services, including certain cloud computing services” and “calls on the Commission to
assess the impact on the private copying system of the use of cloud computing technology for
the private recording and storage of protected works, so as to determine whether these
private copies of protected works should be taken into account by the private copying
compensation mechanisms and, if so, how this should be done”
In AIE’s view, an evolution of the private copying exception is desirable taking into account
an appropriate adaptation to the online environment, with the aim to ensure at the same time a
fair treatment and compensation for the right holders.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
X    YES – Please explain
AIE believes that it is an essential requirement to achieve the effectiveness of the private
copying system.
Through the levy system, consumers are paying for the benefit of being able to make private
copies and it should be clear why they have made this payment. Accountability to consumers
is an important aspect of the Single Market. Having the levy on the invoice would provide
proof of payment of the compensation and would allow the subsidiary debtors to be aware of
the fulfilment of the obligation and, consequently, they will not be liable for the payment.
Secondly, it would promote the accomplishment of the ECJ’s criteria, which establishes that
manufacturers can be the debtors of the compensation inasmuch as they are able to pass on to
private users the actual burden of financing it:
“…it is consistent with the requirements of that ‘fair balance’ to provide that persons who
have digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who, on that basis, in law or in
fact, make that equipment available to private users or provide them with copying services
are the persons liable to finance the fair compensation, inasmuch as they are able to pass on
to private users the actual burden of financing it” (section 50 of Padawan Judgment).


Therefore, the only way to “pass on” the compensation to the final consumers is displaying it
in the relevant invoices. It is important to proof that the obligation of payment has been
actually carried out by the debtors.


60
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          44
It would avoid legal uncertainty and, even, possible inconsistencies between Member States
and double payment for the same equipment and devices.
We also believe that the collective management societies should have power of inspection in
order to check the proper compliance with the rules.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
We consider that a level of harmonization is necessary at this point. Specifically, by reasoning
that the person liable to pay the compensation is a key point of the private copying system.
We do not agree with the solution proposed by Mr Vitorino who considered that the retailer
should be the agent liable for the payment of the levies.
Debtors shall be the importers of the equipment and devices and the manufacturers of such
equipment or devices who distribute them.
Regarding new business models, the service provider should be eligible to pay the levies in
accordance with the capacity of storage (that is proportional to the harm suffered ), although it
would be abusive to pretend that the tariff will have to be fixed in an exponential way
according to the capacity; consequently rules should have to be established regarding the scale
of the capacity of storage, altogether with the consideration of the harm caused to right
holders in order to set up a balance.
By means of the establishment of this system all the possible equipment, devices and services
that are finally sold to final consumers would be covered. We must take into account that the
origin of the devices within a country (or within the European Union) can arise from the
manufacturing inside the country or the importation from abroad. Therefore, the first chain
link would be liable for the payment and the rest of the agents involved in the chain would be
subsidiary liable for the payment in the case that they had not checked the previous payment
of the compensation by the previous agent.
Apart from practical reasons, we think that companies that profit from the sale of the
equipment and devices potentially intended for private copying must be liable to pay private
copying levies. These amounts would be, afterwards, passed on to the final consumers (as it
was stated by the ECJ).

     VI.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an

62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                              46
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The best mechanism should be the one that would allow performers to be fairly remunerated
for the use of their performances in the different contexts of the offline and online.
It should be taken into account that not all the performers have the same bargaining power; of
course, certain popular and well-known artists are in the position of negotiating the
exploitation of all their rights with the phonogram producer with certain assurance of success,
but this is only the exception, not the general rule. The most part of performers are not in a so
privileged situation.
Actually, the main part of the collection for performers comes from the performers CMO’s
under the form of remuneration rights: broadcasting/communication to the public and private
copying. Nevertheless, the making available right is an exclusive right for performers in
almost all the EU countries, which is transferred to the producer and therefore is lost by the
performer for the subsequent exploitations.
As explained in answers to questions of paragraph II.B, the making available right should be
harmonized in the EU as a remuneration right for performers. In such way, they would be
fairly remunerated for the use of their performances in the online environment.
Besides, the role of the performers’ CMO’s must be strengthen, since they are undertaking the
essential task of collecting and distributing the rights to the performers and they should be
also entrusted with the collection of the making available right.
We take this opportunity to tackle the Spanish private copying system, which clearly infringes
International and European Law.
As the Commission may know, the Spanish Government modified the system of fair
compensation for private copying by means of an additional provision in a Royal Decree.
(published in the Bulletin of the State on 31st December 2011)
The system of compensation of Article 25 was changed in its previous configuration. The
additional provision stated also that the Spanish Government would formally establish the
procedure for payment to the recipients of the fair compensation for private copying by means
of an item of the General Budget of the State. The amount of compensation would be
determined based on the estimated harm caused to right holders. However, the amount
established by the Administration (5 million euros regarding 2012 period) was ridiculous
compared to the amount collected by the CMS under the previous system of compensation
(115 million euros approximately concerning 2011 period).

                                                                                              47
The current system is also established in the draft bill for of the Spanish the Intellectual
Property Law, which was recently submitted to the Spanish Parliament (the text was
published through the Boletín Oficial de las Cortes Generales on February 21st, 2014).
Concerning private copying, this draft bill amends the wording of article 25 and 31.2 of the
Spanish law. The former regulates the compensation arising from the private copying
exception while the latter establishes the scope of the exception.
In brief, the Spanish current system intends to justify the unreasonable amount of
compensation by drastically reducing the scope of the exception and the reproductions
eligible to compensation. The reduction of the scope of the exception provokes that a great
number of reproductions carried out by consumers are illegal.
This system does not comply with the ECJ case-law which, as we pointed out in questions
regarding private copying, states that compensation shall be in direct relation to the harm
sustained by right holders for the private copying exception (section 50 of the Padawan Case).
It seems clear that the compensation stated by the Spanish Government is not in accordance
with the harm sustained by right holders.
Apart from that, the ECJ clearly establishes that compensation shall be paid by those
benefiting from the reproductions of protected works (section 50 of the Padawan case). It also
seems obvious that compensation arising from the state budget does not comply with this ECJ
statement.
Additionally, this system clearly infringes the three steps test laid down in Directive 2001/29
and International Treaties (an exception shall only be applied in certain special cases, which
do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder).
It is not fair to narrow the scope of the exception to justify a drastic decrease of the
compensation’s amount, without providing effective tools to protect right holders from illegal
reproductions. In other words narrowing the exception leads to the illegality of most
reproductions, while right holders have no tool to be remunerated for these illegal
reproductions. This harm caused to right holders shall be compensated under The EU Law.
Finally, it must be stressed that Spain is the only country in the EU having put in place a
system like the one described.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
X   YES – Please explain
Yes. As explained in the answers to this consultation and especially in answers to
questions of paragraph II.B, there is an urgent need to harmonize the making available
right for performers, as a remuneration right subject to compulsory collective
management by performers CMO’s.
This legislative measure should have also a reflection in the clauses of the agreements
between producers and performers in the sense of setting up that the remuneration for
performers shall be unwaivable in spite of the transfer of the exclusive right to the producer.
In AIE’s opinion, the European Union should urgently ratify the Beijing Treaty on
audiovisual performances in order to provide efficient protection in favour of audiovisual
performers. As said through this consultation, this Treaty foresees the establishment of a


                                                                                            48
remuneration right once the exclusive making available right has been transferred in favour of
a producer.
Finally, AIE wishes to call for the establishment of a appropriate and coherent private copying
system across the European Union, which avoids the unfair systems such as the Spanish one
mentioned in the previous response. This system should respect the ECJ case-law.

VII.        Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

 VIII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.



                                                                                           50
