Review of the EU Copyright Rules with a focus on digital information
It is estimated that the Internet has represented 3.4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 21% of GDP growth in mature countries over the past five years (www.booz.com). Societal expectations of the infinite possibilities of the internet and the potential offered by new technologies such as cloud computing, broadband access, social media and mobile connectivity places increasing importance on the effects of any changes to Copyright rules and the resulting impact on access to digital information.  Individual users, as well as content providers such as libraries, Digital Content Intermediaries (DCIs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Website owners can be impacted.  

Although the intent of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to provide protection to creators of works is recognized, there is concern that this intent overlooks the access needs of users and the unique potential offered by the internet for access to digital information.  Based on worldstats.com information, as of June 2012, 73% of the population of the European Union uses the internet.  This percentage is significant enough to warrant changes to current Copyright rules for the social, cultural, historical and economic benefit of the EU as well as the rest of the world.  Some of the issues with current Copyright rules are brought to your attention are:

Strict copyright rules are a barrier to scientific, cultural and economic advancement as well as creativity and innovation.  
Long copyright provisions and resulting revenue for generations lack incentives for creators to keep creating. Economic rights restricted by default to 50 years after the creator's death (www.wipo.int) is not conducive to timely use of the information for the betterment of humanity.  Potential users of information created by others are unable to accommodate the risks and consequences of Copyright infringement.  Even after obtaining a copyright license, there is still a great deal of uncertainty, due to the possibility of being taken to court and the difficulty of understanding the complexities of the legal environment.  This influences angel investors who have indicated that 38% of their investment decision is based on legal environments. 

Automatic Copyright protection without the need for registration (www.wipo.int)  is also a major barrier to knowledge creation and access.  It is also the main cause of orphan works and difficulties of obtaining rights to them.  Obtaining a license from an individual copyright holder is not a problem, but when the copyright holder cannot be found, licensing the content can be difficult or impossible. Difficulties of obtaining rights to orphan works and from multiple holders of copyright on single works cause huge hurdles for potential innovators.  Overcoming this problem via negotiating rights to works through intermediaries has also been shown to be time consuming and expensive.

According to the World Intellectual Property Organization Standing Committee on Copyright 2008, Copyright rules have resulted in 128 out of 184 WIPO members creating library exceptions.  However rules particularly with regard to digital copying and digitization are often ambiguous and unclear leading to confusion for librarians and users alike.  

Restrictive Copyright rules and its broad application to providers and users of information is a discouragement to investors in internet based businesses.  
Research has found that many innovators working on revolutionary technologies and many venture capitalists consider copyright law as having harmed innovation in the music industry.   According to research by Booz and Company, investors in Europe would require a total return of 10 times their initial investment in order to generate the same willingness to invest under a regime in which users are held liable for uploading unlicensed content.  Similarly, investors would demand significantly higher returns to move from the current regulatory environment to a copyright regime in which users or DCIs could be held liable for uploaded licensed content.


Costs associated with accessing information including licensing and Copyright compliance can be prohibitive.
Access to information is critical for the continued survival and advancement of humanity and the internet offers a less costly means of access. Maintaining physical libraries and material can be expensive and physical access via libraries is impossible for many.  
Complicated Copyright laws and jurisdictions also pose risks to companies.  According to research conducted by Booz and Company (2011), Pandora, an online music streaming site, felt obliged to identify the complexity of international copyright law as a risk and cited the difficulty of and uncertainty around licensing as the reason for not expanding into new markets.  Also according to the same research, obtaining rights often requires expensive experts and legal counsel, it can take a long time to acquire rights, and, the uncertainty of success can deter license seekers from beginning the process in the first place.

Creators are not always best served through Copyright and licensing.  According to a report from the Harvard Law School, it is estimated that artists in the US typically receive 12 percent in royalties -- out of which they must pay other costs. As a result, between 500,000 and 1 million CDs must be sold for an artist to break even which results in at least 90 percent of artists receiving no royalties at all. However, according to the Forbes magazine as quoted by Booz and Company (2011), 68 % of advertising revenue on YouTube goes to content creators.  This is a sure indication that authors can monetize their ideas without Copyright protection.

The European Union is responsible for making rules and regulations and as such, it is imperative that the Commission consider the recommendations provided below with a view to overcoming the issues with current Copyright rules as mentioned above. 

* Reduce the length of copyright duration.  Options could be for copyright to last for the life of the author or creator or a much reduced period.  This would ensure that the rights owner does not suffer economic losses during his or her lifetime.
* Reduce the complexity of rules and introduce rules with broad acceptance such that members do not need to create jurisdiction based statutes and exceptions.
* Maintain centralized lists of copyrighted material that can automate Copyright management as YouTube does by matching uploaded content with copyright information and notifying the user and rights owner.  
* Reduce or eliminate the need for copyright protection on orphan works.  This will save time effort and cost for those looking to use this information in a timely manner and also reduce the need to get Copyright permission from multiple entities that hold rights to a work.   
* Harmonize library exceptions and enable all libraries to make information available in digital form and not restrict the number of copies, location of use etc.  Open up access to digital assets and digitization on all library materials in order to improve knowledge sharing, reduce cost of access for users and make it easier to provide rights protection where required.
* Minimize the impact on digital content intermediaries (DCIs) that provide search, hosting, and distribution services for digital content because DCIs generate value for content producers by reducing the costs of distribution and allowing many artists to monetize the content they create. They also provide consumers with access to a greater variety and volume of content, as well as an improved consumption experience.  At a minimum Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors should be consulted in drafting any changes to Copyright rules to ensure continued investment in Internet based business.
The need for protecting the rights of creators is understood and the fact that Copyright rules have evolved to some extent to accommodate emerging technologies is recognized.  However, the time is right for a fundamental review of Copyright rules with a view to establishing rules that are balanced, flexible and enduring in order to accommodate the changing needs of society as we go forth into our digital future.  
This is a call for the European Commission to; review Copyright rules in light of the fact that there is no such thing such as original thought and all works are founded on thoughts and ideas that have already been created; consider the broad ecosystem of technology, creativity, knowledge and content sharing as well as recognize all users as creators and all creators as users; consider easing the process for obtaining licensing agreements,  easing or eliminating current Copyright rules to reduce the complexity in existing laws, moving away from the prosecution of end-users in violation of copyright law, and from holding websites and content intermediaries liable for copyright infringement.
