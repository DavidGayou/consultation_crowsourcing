   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  Préambule :


  Le Centre national du livre, parce qu’il concerne et  soutient  toute  la
chaine du livre en France, des  auteurs  et  traducteurs  aux  libraires  en
passant  par  les  éditeurs   et   les   organisateurs   de   manifestations
littéraires, est idéalement placé  pour  comprendre  l’importance  du  droit
d’auteur à la française dans ses deux aspects, patrimonial et moral.


  Le droit moral est indiscutable. Ce principe doit être rappelé.  L’auteur
créée une œuvre, il en décide son début  et  sa  fin,  ses  limites.  Il  en
initie les fulgurances et, parfois, en assume  l’échec.  Prétendre  que  son
œuvre appartiendrait à tous s’apparente dès lors, ni plus  ni  moins,  à  du
vol. Sauf à défendre un modèle de société abolissant  la  propriété  privée,
on doit considérer l’œuvre comme la propriété exclusive de l’auteur.  Est-ce
à dire qu’elle ne pourrait être prolongée, adaptée, citée ? Non. C’est  dire
qu’elle ne peut être trahie. C’est dire que l’accord de  l’auteur,  de   ses
ayant-droits ou héritiers, est préalable à toute  intervention  sur  l’œuvre
C’est dire que le droit de l’auteur à décider du devenir de  son  œuvre  est
incessible. Et que jamais ne cesse,  même  après  sa  mort,  le  droit  d’un
auteur à refuser qu’on trahisse sa création, son propos, son œuvre.


  Le droit patrimonial est  une  autre  question.  L’auteur  doit   pouvoir
légitimement vivre de son œuvre sans que celle-ci  ne  soit  pillée,  copiée
sans autorisation ou volée. De même l’éditeur, qui prend  le  risque  de  la
publication pour l’œuvre papier comme pour l’œuvre numérique, doit voir  ses
droits préservés et défendus. Non pour défendre on ne sait  quelle  chapelle
ou intérêt particulier mais simplement parce qu’une œuvre  de  l’écrit  doit
être éditée. Elle a besoin de ce travail que fait  l’éditeur  de  relecture,
de correction ; l’auteur a besoin d’un regard exigeant et critique  sur  son
œuvre. Pour autant est-il possible, à l’heure du numérique, d’appliquer  les
mêmes droits à l’œuvre numérique qu’au papier ? Rien n’est moins sûr.  C’est
pourquoi  auteurs  et  éditeurs  se  sont  entendus,  en  France,  pour  une
évolution des dispositions relatives au  contrat  d’édition  via  un  nouvel
accord  entre  auteurs  et  éditeurs  que   la   loi   française   reprendra
prochainement.






  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?

[Open question]


Dans le domaine du livre, il n’y a pas de  difficultés  pour  l’exploitation
des œuvres sur  tous  les  territoires,  dans  la  langue  d’origine  ou  en
traduction. De manière générale, les droits sont cédés  dans  leur  ensemble
par l’auteur à l’éditeur pour le monde  entier.  Le  livre  peut  donc  être
disponible dans tous les pays.

      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure

      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain

Les dispositions législatives  instaurées  par  la  directive  de  2001  ont
permis de maintenir un cadre souple et adapté à l’exploitation  des  œuvres,

services  de  contenu.  Il  n’est  donc  pas  nécessaire  de   prévoir   une
intervention législative complémentaire en matière de droits d’auteur.


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


x YES


Le droit de  mise  à  disposition  est  suffisamment  clair  au  regard  des
utilisations actuelles réalisées de façon transfrontière.  En  France,  pour
les  auteurs  de  l’écrit,  la  loi  définit  deux  droits,  le   droit   de
reproduction et le droit de représentation, qui sont cédés à l’éditeur  pour
tous les modes d’exploitation du livre, y  compris  pour  des  exploitations
multi-territoriales.




€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO


x NO OPINION


La définition de la qualité d'auteur n'est pas harmonisée dans le  droit  de
l’Union européenne.  Cela  pourrait  poser  certaines  questions,  comme  le
soulève  ce  questionnaire,  notamment  au  regard  de  l'identification  du
titulaire de droits. Or, ces questions ne sont pas en rapport avec  l'aspect
transfrontière, mais se posent  de  façon  générale,  et  pas  seulement  au
regard des droits de propriété intellectuelle. La preuve  de  la  titularité
des droits étant libre, il est  difficile,  pour  ne  pas  dire  impossible,
d'apporter  des  solutions  législatives  pouvant   régler   des   problèmes
multiples et de natures différentes.





Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are

L’hyperlien vers un contenu protégé et commercialisé constitue  un  acte  de
communication au public qui entre  dans  le  champ  du  droit  d’auteur.  Il
nécessite donc une autorisation préalable des titulaires de droits.


Lorsqu'un lien renvoie, sans objectif  commercial,  à  une  œuvre  librement
accessible et légalement mise en ligne sur Internet, et  respecte  le  droit
moral de l'auteur d'origine, il ne nous semble pas nécessaire d’obtenir  une
autorisation préalable. Les auteurs utilisent largement  dans  leurs  œuvres
numériques cette possibilité  qui  fait  l’originalité  et  la  richesse  du
réseau.


En revanche, si ces hyperliens sont utilisés par  des  opérateurs  réalisant
directement ou indirectement des profits par  la  diffusion  de  ces  œuvres
enrichies, un partage juste et équitable de la  valeur  commerciale  induite
doit être envisagé.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have

[Open question]


Les textes de l’Union européenne et internationaux ne prévoient le  principe
de l'épuisement du droit de distribution que  pour  les  copies  matérielles
des œuvres protégées par un droit de propriété intellectuelle,  c'est-à-dire
des supports physiques d’une œuvre.


La notion même de revente de fichiers numériques ne peut  pas  exister  dans
le  domaine  du  livre.   En  dehors  de  la  question   technique   de   la
différenciation ou une altération des œuvres numériques neuves  par  rapport
à celles qui seraient commercialisées sur un  marché  de  l'occasion  et  du
dessaisissement du fichier revendu par le  premier  acheteur,  impossible  à
contrôler en pratique, il s’agit d’éviter le développement d’un  marché  qui
viendrait en concurrence directe avec le marché initial et qui  contredirait
à l’esprit de la loi française.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].

      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES

  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Les autorités françaises estiment que l'identification des œuvres et  autres
objets protégés est la question prioritaire sur laquelle il faut  concentrer
les efforts d'une  politique  communautaire.  Les  autorités  françaises  se
félicitent  que  la   Commission,   dans   ce   questionnaire,   reconnaisse
l'importance des initiatives comme le « Global Repertoire Database »  ou  la
« Linked Content Coalition » qui travaillent à la  fois  à  l'identification
des œuvres par des bases de données et à leur interopérabililité.


Dans ce cadre, les autorités françaises souhaitent insister sur les  formats
existant d'identification des œuvres,  notamment,  en  ce  qui  concerne  le
livre, ISBN (International Standard Book Number)  ou  l’audiovisuel,  l'ISAN
(International Standard Audiovisual  Number),  qui  devraient  pouvoir  être
facilement étendus pour pouvoir permettre  une  identification  systématique
et  automatisée  des  contenus.  Un  tel  mécanisme   d'identification   est
parfaitement conciliable avec les obligations internationales  et  bénéficie
déjà de retours d'expérience en France, notamment avec les utilisations  des
archives audiovisuelles de l'Institut National de l'Audiovisuel.


Dans le cadre de la loi sur les livres indisponibles, la  France  a  mis  en
place une base de données qui permet d'identifier les œuvres réputées  comme
telles. Cette  base  est  la  première  étape  nécessaire  à  l'exploitation
numérique qui va être faite par la suite. Les autorités françaises  estiment
en  conséquence  que  de  tels  schémas  d'identification   devraient   être
facilités au niveau  de  l’Union  car  ils  constituent  la  base  de  toute
utilisation de contenus sur internet. C'est d'ailleurs l'orientation  qui  a
été prise dans le cadre de la directive sur les œuvres orphelines qui a  mis
en place une base de  données  permettant  d'identifier  les  œuvres  et  de
connaître leurs utilisations. Dans le même  sens,  l'effort  del’Union  doit
porter sur l'interopérabilité  des  bases  de  données  existantes  afin  de
pouvoir mettre en commun ces ressources.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Conformément à l’article 5.2 de la Convention de Berne ratifiée par  l’Union
Européenne, l’enregistrement ne peut être une condition ni de protection  ni
d’exercice des droits. En conséquence, si un  tel  enregistrement  existait,
il ne devrait en aucun  cas  constituer  un  préalable  obligatoire.  Aucune
différence en termes de régime des  droits  ne  devrait  exister  entre  les
œuvres enregistrées et non enregistrées.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


Nous rappelons  que  dans  le  domaine  du  livre,  il  existe  un  standard
international d’enregistrement et  d’identification,  l’ISBN  (International
Standard   Book   Number),   numéro   international   normalisé   permettant
l’identification  d’un  livre  dans  une  édition  donnée.  Il  conviendrait
également de favoriser le développement de  l’ISTC  (International  Standard
Text  Code),  numéro  international  destiné   à   identifier   les   œuvres
textuelles, c'est-à-dire un contenu constitué en majorité de mots.


Ces deux identidiants  ne  permettent  cependant  pas  la  localisation  des
ayants droit.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

x YES – Please explain


La durée de  protection  des  droits  d’auteur  ne  pose  pas  de  problèmes

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

x NO – Please explain


Le caractère facultatif d’une exception ou d’une limitation permet à  chaque
État membre d’intégrer les exceptions ou limitations qui soient  compatibles
avec son système législatif. À défaut de pouvoir demander une obligation  de

faculté de compenser ou non les exceptions et limitations.

trois étapes prévu notamment par la Directive 2001/29.

toutes les situations. Il ne nous semble pas nécessaire d’en ajouter.


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why

insécurité juridique.

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

La question de la prise  en  charge  de  la  compensation  peut  se  révéler
délicate. Elle devrait théoriquement  être  prise  en  charge  par  le  pays
importateur, le pays dans lequel se trouve le bénéficiaire de l’exception.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

Pour la numérisation de masse des livres indisponibles du XXème  siècle,  la
France a mis en place une solution qui ne passe pas par  une  exception.  La
loi n° 2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative  à  l'exploitation  numérique  des
livres indisponibles du XXe siècle repose sur  un  transfert  de  l'exercice
des droits à une société de gestion collective, gérée paritairement par  des
représentants des auteurs et des  éditeurs.  Le  mécanisme  de  la  loi  est
respectueux de la volonté des titulaires  de  droit  d'auteur  qui  peuvent,
pendant un délai de six mois, refuser l'exploitation collective  des  œuvres
préalablement inscrites sur une liste  recensant  les  œuvres  indisponibles
destinées à être numérisées. Dans ce  cas,  les  auteurs  peuvent  exploiter
directement leurs œuvres. Lorsque les droits ont été cédés à un éditeur,  ce
dernier dispose de deux ans pour exploiter directement l’œuvre sur  la  base
d'une rémunération décidée contractuellement. A  défaut  d'exploitation,  le
livre entrera dans le champ de la  gestion  collective  pour  être  exploité
dans le cadre d'une numérisation de masse.

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

cause cette gestion.


La seule différence réside dans le fait que la copie privée  est  basée  sur

      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Dans le domaine de l’écrit, l’impact est  sans  doute  marginal.  Néanmoins,
dans le cadre de la rémunération des ayants droit, la  copie  privée  permet

les nuages ». Dans ce cas, il n’y a pas à modifier le  régime  de  la  copie
privée, mais seulement de l’étendre à ces usages.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

La France s'est penchée sur la question de la rémunération adéquate dans  le
cadre du contrat d'édition numérique des livres.  La  solution  retenue  est
celle d'une modification législative à venir articulée avec un accord  cadre
qui précisera les obligations  réciproques  des  parties  et  notamment  les
conditions  de  rémunération,  de  reddition  des  comptes...  La   solution
contractuelle retenue correspond au libre  choix  des  titulaires  qui  doit
prévaloir dans le  cadre  des  droits  de  propriété  intellectuelle.  Cette
liberté de choix a d'ailleurs été consacrée au niveau communautaire dans  la
proposition de directive sur la gestion collective  qui  pose  le  principe,
dans son article 5.2, de la  liberté  du  titulaire  de  mettre  ou  non  en
gestion collective les droits de son choix.


Les autorités françaises estiment donc en conséquence  que  la  rémunération
la plus juste est assurée par la liberté contractuelle.

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

x YES – Please explain


La  Directive  2004/48/CE  sur  la  protection  des  droits   de   propriété
intellectuelle introduit de nouveaux mécanismes permettant  de  lutter  plus
efficacement  contre  l’essor  de  la  contrefaçon.   Toutefois,   certaines
améliorations pourraient être apportées afin de rendre la mise en  œuvre  de
cette directive encore plus  efficace  dans  la  protection  des  droits  de
propriété intellectuelle.


€ NO – Please explain

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

De nouvelles  activités  économiques  ont  vu  le  jour  dans  le  cadre  du
développement de l’environnement numérique et n’ont pas  nécessairement  été
prises en compte lors de l’élaboration de la  Directive  2004/48/CE,  or  il
apparaît que ces nouveaux acteurs de l’Internet sont  le  plus  souvent  les
mieux placés pour mettre un terme aux actes de contrefaçon ou pour  prévenir
de tels actes.

Il   apparaît   en   effet   indispensable   d’adapter   le   dispositif   à
l’environnement numérique en impliquant plus étroitement les  intermédiaires
de l'internet  dans  la  lutte  contre  la  contrefaçon,  notamment  par  la
possibilité d’obtenir des injonctions à l’encontre  de  toutes  les  parties
qui facilitent ou contribuent à la commission d’actes  de  contrefaçon  afin
de mettre fin à ces actes illégaux ou  de  les  prévenir  efficacement.  Les
autorités françaises estiment que les prestataires de services sur  internet
ont un rôle évident à jouer tant dans le cadre  du  respect  des  droits  de
propriété intellectuelle que celui du  respect  de  la  vie  privée  et  des
données personnelles.


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

x YES – Please explain


Le respect du droit d’auteur est garanti par des  moyens  légaux  appropriés
qui ne remettent pas en cause les principes fondamentaux des  droits  de  la
personnalité.


Cette question est orientée. Ce ne sont sans doute pas les  auteurs  ou  les
éditeurs qui mettent en danger la protection de la vie privée et  celle  des
données à caractère personnel que, bien plutôt,  ceux  qui,  comme  certains
acteurs de l’Internet, combattent le principe même de droit d’auteur  chaque
fois que cela est possible


€ NO – Please explain

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


x NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]
La priorité doit être donnée à la recherche des solutions  appropriées  pour
droit d’auteur  à  l’ère  numérique  et  notamment  à  la  lutte  contre  la
contrefaçon des contenus sur internet, à la rémunération e la création et  à
la facilitation des usages  légaux.   Dans  ce  cadre,  un  renforcement  de
l'harmonisation des procédures et moyens d'actions est  nécessaire  afin  de
conduire une lutte efficace contre les sites illégaux.
L’établissement d’un cadre unitaire  pour  le  droit  d’auteur  à  l’échelon
européen ne saurait  constituer  une  priorité  pertinente.  En  effet,  les
traditions juridiques différentes au sein des États  membres  ne  permettent
pas d'envisager aujourd’hui une démarche en ce sens.

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

1/ Il est essentiel de réaliser ou de faire  réaliser  une  véritable  étude
d’impact économique (revenus de  la  création,  valeur  ajoutée  culturelle,
emplois...) avant d'envisager toute réforme importante. Une  étude  sur  les
revenus de la création commandée par la Commission  européenne  a  ainsi  de
manière tout à fait surprenante exclu de son champ le secteur du  livre.  Il
est urgent que cette étude soit de  nouveau  envisagée,  comme  cela  a  été
annoncé à plusieurs reprises par le chef de l’unité Droits d’auteur à la  DG
Marché intérieur et services.


De telles études se développent en France, à l'exemple des  récents  travaux
réalisés par le cabinet Ernst and  Young  sur  le  panorama  des  industries
culturelles                                (http://www.francecreative.fr/wp-
content/uploads/2013/10/Panorama-Industries-culturelles-et-
créatives_2511.pdf ), et de l'enquête « Economie et emploi dans  le  secteur
de  la   culture »   (http://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/03-rapport-igf-igac-
culture-economie.pdf ), réalisée en 2013 à l'initiative  des  ministères  de
l’économie et de la culture





2/ Par ailleurs, le discours  selon  lequel  le  droit  d’auteur  serait  un
obstacle à la circulation des œuvres se révèle à  l'examen  des  faits  sans
aucun fondement. Non seulement le  droit  d’auteur  n’est  pas  un  frein  à
l’exploitation des œuvres, mais il constitue  la  condition  essentielle  du
développement de la diversité culturelle, dans  un  environnement  équilibré
pour tous les acteurs de la chaîne, de l’auteur jusqu’au lecteur. Il est  en
cela l'un des éléments fondamentaux de création de  richesses  et  d'emplois
pour  la  France  et  pour  l'Europe,  et  la  condition  sine  qua  non  du
rayonnement de la pensée et des langues européennes.


En revanche, l'absence d’interopérabilité constatée dans l'accès aux  œuvres
de la part des  grands  opérateurs  techniques  internationaux,  quand  elle
n'est  pas  sciemment   organisée   par   ces   derniers,   et   le   manque
d'harmonisation fiscale  entre  les  pays  européens  constituent  de  réels
freins à la diffusion des œuvres, de création récente ou du  patrimoine,  et
à leur accès par le plus grand nombre.


Le Centre national du livre estime que les Etats sont les mieux à  même,  et
finalement les seuls, à pouvoir  décider,  pour  ce  qui  les  concerne,  de
mécanismes de protection  des  auteurs.  Le  combat  régulier  que  mène  la
Commission contre l’exception culturelle alors même qu’elle  est  signataire
de la charte de l’Unesco ne la qualifie pas pour parler au nom  des  auteurs
et des intervenants de la chaîne du livre.


Enfin, le Centre national du livre  déplore  que  la  Commission  européenne
n’ait diffusé le questionnaire qu’en langue anglaise et  dans  aucune  autre
langue de travail  de  l’Union  européenne.  Un  tel  choix  apparaît  comme
particulièrement préjudiciable sur un sujet aussi  vital  pour  l’avenir  de
l’Europe et de sa culture et  ne  peut  que  nuire  à  l’information  et  la
consultation du public européen.

and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses

[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
