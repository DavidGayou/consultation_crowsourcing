                    ONCE’S RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON
                           THE REVIEW OF THE EU COPYRIGHT RULES

The Spanish National Organization of the Blind (ONCE) thanks the European Commission for
this consultation, as it is of crucial significance for people with disabilities in general, and for
people with visual disabilities in particular. We therefore provide our response to those
questions which, due to the nature of its content, are very important for us.


        21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
        provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

Yes, as most of the initial Directive’s objective, whose aim was the “harmonising of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights ”, is lost. Regarding the particular group whose interests
ONCE advocates for(blind people and people with visual disabilities), the fact that the
exception referring to them, ( Article 5, 3.b) of the Directive 2001/20/EC), represents just 1 out
of the 20 optional limitations that exist, has given way to a wide range of situations that
nowadays constitute obstacles when trying to achieve a wide and homogeneous ratification of
the Marrakech Treaty, in order to facilitate access to published works for blind people,
people with visual disabilities and people with print disabilities in some of the Member
States. This is happening because each country has given a different degree of importance to
the adoption of the previously mentioned exception, and to this exception’s transposition in
their respective national legislations.


        22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
        for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions

We understand that it is not easy to make all exceptions and limitations mandatory, as they
have a different nature and their respective objectives are too heterogeneous.

However, the possibility of making the exception regarding people with disabilities (Art. 5, 3.b)
mandatory should indeed be considered, at least in its Basic principles, in order to enable the
effective implementation of the Marrakech Treaty, and to comply also, in first instance, with
Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Person’s with Disabilities, which was ratified
by the EU on the 23rd of December, 2010, and where it is stated that “States Parties shall take
appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with
others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications,
including information and communications technologies and systems ”.

Epigraphs f) and g) of the above mentioned Article 9 are equally important, as they demand:

“f) Promote other appropriate forms of assistance and support to persons with disabilities to
ensure their access to information;

g) Promote access for persons with disabilities to new information and communications
technologies and systems, including the Internet”.

We consider that the rights and the effective inclusion of blind people and people with visual
disabilities in European society cannot be subject to arbitrary decisions on whether an
exception is adopted or not, and on how that exception is transposed in national legislation.
An exception on access to information cannot be given the same treatment as quotations,
political speeches or the selling of works of Art.
Basic levels of harmonisation and mandatory standards must be achieved in the case of
exceptions such as the one we are referring to, with the aim of preventing a situation whereby
a person with a visual disability may enjoy different rights in different countries of the EU.



        26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
        constitute a problem?

Yes, as it prevents blind people and people with visual disabilities, as well as the institutions
representing them, from importing/exporting works in accessible formats among Member
States, with all that this implies.

Exporting and importing works in accessible formats represent effective means of sharing the
scarce percentage of works that are available, as well as accessing the archives in other
languages that institutions are currently producing for their own users.

Nowadays, a work in a specific language has to be produced fully in each of the Member States
where the official language is spoken (the UK and Ireland, France and Belgium, Austria and
Germany,…etc.). Moreover, there are countries where, despite the fact that they may have
adopted the exception that enables the production of books in accessible formats within their
national legislations, they lack either the institutions or enough resources to assume the costs
implied in their production and distribution, while such production may have already been
carried out in that language in a different EU country

The lack of provisions in this regard within the exception contemplated in Art. 5, 3.b) of the
above mentioned Directive, does not allow for a more rational use of the scarce number of
resources that institutions providing services to blind people and people with visual disabilities
have, while it also makes more difficult for their members to access an Information Society
which is clearly multilingual. While people without disabilities can access works written in
any of the EU languages through the commercial means better suited to their needs, blind
people and people with visual disabilities see their access to works produced in other
languages unfairly restricted. Furthermore, the costs implied in the production of these works
are extremely high in those countries where that specific language does not constitute an
official language.

Explicit permission for exporting and importing Works in accessible formats can be easily
obtainable through a Fast and effective ratification and implementation of the Marrakech
Treaty in each of the Member States. This treaty enables the Exchange of Works both at the
European level and worldwide, without having to request for specific permission from those
who hold their copyright

        50. a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
        persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to
        content, including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
        this exception?

The implementation of this exception, even when such implementation may be done widely
and generously, does not include or imply at all the potential access to works in accessible
formats produced in other Member States from a cross-border perspective. The issue then lies
on the actual exception, rather than on its implementation. This exception does not
contemplate or allow for this possibility to happen, even despite the fact that there is a Single
Market within the EU, which permits the free circulation of goods.


        50. b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with
        disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating
        works published in special formats across the EU?

Yes. Mainly the fact that it is not possible to do it outside our borders. Despite the great
interest of blind and partially-sighted people from the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden,
Denmark, France and Germany (to mention some) in the books in Spanish that ONCE makes
available to its users, our organization has had to decline in many occasions the multiple
requests because the legal framework was not the right one.


        51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

In relation to documents in accessible formats, accessibility is based on three main pillars:
production, distribution and use of those documents

Production and distribution are expressed within the exception we are referring to, and the
fastest and most efficient way to harmonise them and improve them would be through the
ratification and implementation of the above mentioned Marrakech Treaty. This treaty
specifically allows for the production and distribution (at the national and the International
levels) of all documents in accessible formats that have been produced thanks to an exception
to copyright.

The use of those documents, that is, the way in which the end user accesses them is a much
more complex issue, which depends on the manner in which the book is published (mainly e-
books, which are more likely to be used by people with visual disabilities); on the accessibility
of the actual devices being used to red them e-book readers, whose navigation systems,
menus, etc, are not very accessible or not accessible at all), and on the potential difficulties to
access the book itself when protecting a published work from being illegally used.

In this regard, it is true that the current Directive expresses in its Article 6.4 that “Member
States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that rightholders make available to the
beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided for in national law in accordance with Article
5(2)(a), (2)(c), (d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or (3)(e) the means of benefiting from that exception or
limitation, to the extent necessary to benefit from that exception or limitation….”. However,
such provision can be without effect for those Works which are distributed “on demand”, as it


                                            Page 3 of 6
                             EU Transparency Register ID Number 68612977691-59

is expressed in the fourth paragraph of Article 6, “The provisions of the first and second
subparagraphs shall not apply to works or other subject-matter made available to the public on
agreed contractual terms in such a way that members of the public may access them from a
place and at a time individually chosen by them.”. Therefore, it should be more clearly
expressed, regardless of how the work has been legally acquired, that the work must come in a
format accessible for the user, while being protected against its illegal use through whatever
technological means may be required.


        52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
        How successful are they?

The market makes available for all content producers a series of technological Tools, which
enable them to do almost any sort of document in an accessible format, as well as other tools
that allow people with some sort of visual disability to read them. There existence within the
market does not imply that those tools are being used to the degree they should be

The Publishing World considers books in accessible audio formats or in Braille format as
products that do not fit into their catalogue, as they are specifically for people with
disabilities. It also estimates that adding accessibility guidelines to their e-books can slow
down the production process and add (unnecessary) extra costs. Without doubt, this type of
books requires the least degree of effort when incorporating accessibility guidelines to their
production process, particularly after the new EPUB standard, and e-books would be the type
of publication most likely to become the so long-awaited “book for all” and combat the
profound “book famine” that people with disabilities are suffering when accessing a printed
text.

While ONCE and other entities our organization is a member of such as the Daisy Consortium,
the European Blind Union or the World Blind Union, consider that a “book for all” no longer is
a “utopian” goal in technological terms, they are also aware that the devices being used to
reed these books have also to comply with minimum accessibility standards that will allow
users to enjoy the books in accessible formats.

According to these considerations, it is not possible to estimate the success that these Tools
can have outside the field of people with visual disabilities and the entities representing them.
Without doubt, the success on this issue will depend on the degree of adoption within the
book world, as the degree of adoption is currently non-existent. This means that legal
measures are necessary to enable the production and distribution of these Works in accessible
formats with no more limitations than those imposed by the international legal obligations the
EU is currently subjected to.


        80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
        copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

From ONCE, we understand that once the Marrakech Treaty has been signed, the EU cannot
ignore this situation and delay any more its ratification. Instead, the EU must incorporate into
the review of the copyright rules as many changes and/or adjustments as necessary, in order
to adapt the legislation to it, so that its Member States can do the same.

The Marrakech Treaty is the first treaty to Develop, in a direct and efficient manner, the
commitment that the EU and almost all its Member States acquired when they signed and
ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

We understand that the EU should set a good example and consolidate its crucial contribution,
through the rapid ratification and transposition of the previously mentioned treaty in its
legislation, so that no European citizen sees his or her right to access education and
employment through books in accessible format denied because they are blind or have a visual
disability

It is essential that the review of the current Directive on Copyright that the Commission has
decided to embark on, does not either prejudice or interfere with the Rights of people with
disabilities, allowing for its parallel implementation and whatever is necessary so that the
EU, as an entity with its own legal status, ratifies the Marrakech Treaty, in strict compliance
with what is established by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.



ABOUT ONCE
The Spanish National Organization of the Blind (ONCE) is a public corporation of a social
nature. All blind and severely partially sighted people in Spain may join ONCE. Its activities
cover the entire Spanish territory and, at present, it has approximately 71,000 members.
ONCE carries out actions favouring social inclusion, equal opportunities, non discrimination
and achieving full rights as citizens for the people it represents. ONCE has become a well-
organised and specialised organisation addressing social issues, co-operating with and
complementing the work of state public authorities in developing social protection policies for
a sector of the population which runs the risk of being excluded due to severe disability, as is
the case with people who are blind or severely partially sighted.
ONCE’s social nature incorporates the principles and values of solidarity, general interest and
non-profit making in the purpose and aims of the organisation, while allowing economic,
commercial and business activities to be developed in order to ensure funding for its social
goals and overall financial stability.
ONCE’s financial resources come mainly from marketing several gaming products (the most
popular of which is the “Cupón”, or “Coupon”), in addition to profits from its business activities
which, at the same time, enable both people with a visual impairment and persons with other
disabilities to integrate in the labour market.
At the same time, ONCE is committed to solidarity with the wider disability sector. To this end,
it is engaged in carrying out activities in the fields of training, employment and universal
accessibility by and for persons with disabilities, in other words approximately four million
Spanish citizens.
ONCE’s activities can also be seen at the international level, where it works to improve the
quality of life for blind people in other parts of the world, mainly in Latin America, Portugal,
Eastern Europe and North Africa.
