                                Contribution to
          Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules
1.	Definition of place of communication to the public
Article 3 of the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC provides:
Article 3
Right of communication to the public of works and right of making available to the public other subject-matter
1. Member States shall provide authors with the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
2. Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them:
(a) for performers, of fixations of their performances;
(b) for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;
(c) for the producers of the first fixations of films, of the original and copies of their films;
(d) for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.
3. The rights referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be exhausted by any act of communication to the public or making available to the public as set out in this Article.
The making available to the public procedure in Article 3 is here referred to as "making available on demand"

Article 3 contains no definition of the place or places of communication to the public or of making available on demand of the respective subject matters there described. Article 3 implements provisions of the WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996 (Article 8), and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty 1996 (Articles 10, 14), which Treaty Articles also do not contain a definition of the relevant places of communication including making available on demand (the same applies as regards Article 10 of the WIPO Audiovisual Performances Treaty 2012 (not yet in force)).

Similarly, there are no definitions of place of communication to the public in respect of rights granted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 1971, Universal Copyright Convention 1971 and Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations Convention 1961 or the TRIPS Agreement 1994.

Two theories are considered concerning place of communication to the public, the communication theory and the emission theory.  

According to the communication theory, communication to the public takes place at the point of initial transmission and at the point or points of reception, this theory being founded on the Bogsch theory related to broadcasting.

According to the emission theory, broadcasting takes place at the point of initial transmission.  The Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive 93/83/EC reflects the emission theory but only as regards certain (mainly EU-related) transmissions (Article 1(2) of the Directive).  In other cases national law applies.

Definition of the place or places of communication to the public and of making available on demand is of vital importance for the effective protection of authors' rights and related rights, to give clarity as to where these acts take place and thus facilitate licensing procedures and allow effective proceedings to be taken for remedies against infringing acts. 

Proposal:  that in respect of Article 3 of the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC the place or places of communication to the public including of making available on demand should be clarified by amending legislation.  

2.	Recognition and protection of copyright and related rights in Space
Copyright law today is based on a concept of territorial protection.  In general national, regional and international laws do not deal specifically with protection in extraterritorial areas, including Space, of copyright and related rights.
United Nations Treaties and Agreements while covering many aspects of activities in Space, do not specifically deal with such activities in respect of copyright and related rights.
The abovementioned international instruments and EU Directives and other EU legal instruments do not specifically deal with the recognition or protection of copyright and related rights in Space.  
It can be confidently anticipated that increasing numbers of individuals and governmental and non-governmental entities will be present in Space, both in Space craft and on the surfaces of the Moon, planets and other objects in Space, with issues arising as to subsistence and infringement of copyright and related rights, for instance as regards use of protected material in Space and communication of such material to Earth. It is hoped that the World Intellectual Property Organisation will undertake studies in this area with a view to the conclusion of a Space Copyright Treaty.
Proposal:  that studies be immediately instituted with a view to elaborating principles which ensure that material protected or protectable in the European Union by copyright and related rights will be similarly protected in Space.
