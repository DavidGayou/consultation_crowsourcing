                             Public Consultation
                   on the review of the EU copyright rules
Executive Summary

ARD welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the public consultation on the “review of the
EU copyright rules”.

ARD stands for the “Association of Public Service Broadcasting Corporations in the Federal
Republic of Germany”. ARD consists of nine independent broadcasting corporations under
state law. The programming provided by ARD and its member corporations for its national
audience covers a wide range of listener and viewer interests including news, education,
culture and entertainment.

The contribution of ARD and other European Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs) in the
digital market for legal content offers is vibrant. The successful Online-Mediathek of ARD in
Germany is a perfect example in this respect.

One of the main objectives of ARD is to provide licence fee payers with a maximum of
choice. This choice not only refers to the variety of content but also to the means of delivery
and access anywhere and anytime.

ARD strongly believes in the “community-building” concept of free flow of information. It is
guided by the belief that its national programming, hence German culture and creativity,
should be accessible as easy as possible. ARD’s content highly contributes to the cultural and
journalistic diversity in Europe.

Wherever legally possible, ARD makes its content available across frontiers. That has already
been the case with distribution of linear broadcasting services via Cable and via Satellite
retransmission, which has been a great success story due to the provisions of the 1993 Cable
and Satellite Directive.

The Cab/Sat-Directive has paved the way for a single market for content in the “traditional”
broadcasting world. The same idea should help creating a digital single content market.

While PSBs play an important role in Europe’s digital economy, they are facing major
challenges and obstacles especially with respect to copyright online, such as burdensome
rights clearance processes.




                                                                                             1
ARD is convinced the changes PSBs are proposing with respect to European copyright law1
will help the whole creative sector to flourish and will have an important impact on the ability
of SME’s to grow in a digital environment.

ARD, as both a major rights holder and a major user of rights, believes that any reform in
copyright must be balanced and include a simple, cost effective and platform neutral rights
clearance system which is truly future proof and gives broadcasters urgently needed legal
certainty.



Key recommendations:


1. Technological neutrality and Country of Origin

With the emergence of ever new services online and an ongoing technological revolution,
clearing the rights for the use of works under copyright becomes more and more diversified,
complex and legally uncertain.

ARD believes that the existing provisions of the Cab/Sat-Directive have proven their success
for linear cable and satellite broadcasting. Therefore, the technological neutral extension of
the country of origin principle for broadcasters’ simulcasting and catch-up services and the
technological neutral extension of the provisions on cable retransmission to other equivalent
(closed) platforms would be the most effective solution for the existing problems.

This would be an effective and simple way to facilitate rights clearance online, while securing
the interests and needs of all rights holders.

2. Promotion of Extended Collective Licensing Agreements in Member States

As a mass user of works under copyright providing its services via a number of different
distribution platforms, collective licensing remains vital for ARD in the digital age and will be
even more the only effective way to clear rights for programmes.

Extended collective licensing agreements are an extremely helpful tool for simple clearance
of rights for broadcasters. Since they respect the will of the rights holder (they can opt out of
the system), they create a win-win situation for users (broadcasters) and rights holders. This
system would be especially of value where it comes to burdensome rights clearance processes
as for the archive problem or for the licensing of a whole online offer of a broadcaster
including the non-linear content on a third party platform.

3. One single economic activity should not be split into separate rights

Wherever the reproduction right only occurs in the process of an online streaming service and
therefore constitutes only a mere ephemeral by-product, it should be covered by the license of
the main copyright relevant act.

4. Limitations and Exceptions

For their daily work, broadcasters rely on the limitations and exceptions when it comes to the
use of copyright protected material. Legal uncertainty might occur, whether the conditions of
the limitations and exceptions are fulfilled in all Member States. The application of the
country of origin principle would be the easiest and safest solution for such cases.

5. Framing

Framing should be covered by the right to communicate the work to the public since the
framing website has the fundamental role in communicating the protected work to the public
and the role of the website which hosts the protected content is basically reduced to a
technical tool for the framing website. Framing should, if at all, only be possible without prior
authorisation in a purely non-commercial context under the precondition that the source of the
framed content is adequately indicated.

   II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the
EU?

X YES

                                                                                               3
As part of their public service remit ARD-Members have to provide online services in a linear
and non-linear way. On demand services – such as catch-up TV or Radio – by law have to be
clearly related to linear programmes. In order to fulfil this public service mission online, from
a copyright perspective different kinds of rights are needed – the broadcasting right on the one
hand and the right of making available on the other hand.

Broadcasting via the internet may be provided by simulcasting (simultaneous transmission of
a satellite or terrestrial programme) or as webcasting (an original broadcast offered via the
internet only). Especially the case of simulcasting clearly shows, which legal uncertainties
broadcasters have to face.

With the introduction of the country of origin principle in the Cab/Sat-Directive it is clear for
satellite broadcasting that only the law of the country is applicable where the uplink takes
place.

Unfortunately there is no equivalent rule when the same content is broadcasted
simultaneously via the internet and – by using this medium – access for users from countries
beyond the broadcaster’s country of residence becomes possible. Which law is applicable in
this case? Given this legal uncertainty many licensors demand the use of geo-blocking in
order to avoid any “overspill” of the possible reception outside the country of origin. Often,
these licensors simply fear to be obliged to do so since they only own the rights for the
broadcaster’s territory. They do not want to run the risk to infringe the rights of the rights
owners for other territories if they license the content without geo-blocking. As a result, every
single rights holder in the chain of rights is in a position to interrupt the free flow of
information via the internet by interfering this way. From the perspective of the user outside
the country of origin access to content from another country is limited.

For example: When the Belgium cable operator Belgacom decided to no longer distribute
ARD via its IP-TV-network and Belgacom-customers complained that they could no longer
watch ARD, it was not possible to simply refer to ARD’s live streaming over the internet.
Simulcasting was no equivalent substitute because too often the simulcast is blocked by geo-
location in order to avoid the reception in the neighbouring countries due to the requirements
of rights owners.

The constraint to use geo-location measures to block an external reception of course also
occurs when it comes to webcasting. Here as well, a real free flow of information is by far not
achievable in practice. In other words: There is no single European “communication area”.

The distribution of non-linear audiovisual services is even more complicated, despite the fact,
that these services closely relate to the content distributed via broadcasting. The main reasons
are the fact, that less content is represented by collecting societies; the lack of clarity, whether
the mere viewing by the user is regarded as a copyright relevant act (display or screen right)
and which rights are involved for technical reasons (are incidental copies relevant?).

Furthermore there is no country of origin principle one could refer to at least in analogy since
the Cab/Sat-Directive unfortunately only covers linear broadcasting. Therefore, the question
of the applicable law is also at stake.



                                                                                                  4
The same applies – to give the full picture – in both cases (linear and non-linear) with regard
to retransmission. Here as well, substantial legal uncertainties occur.

The Cab/Sat-Directive offers a well functioning regime for the retransmission of programme
via traditional cable-networks. Unfortunately, the Directive explicitly only refers to the
technology of cable-retransmission. The Directive leaves open the question, whether also
other (new) technologies like DSL, IP-TV etc. would fall within the scope of this Directive
and whether the facilities it offers for the rights clearance by the cable-operator are also
provided for other platform operators. The same lack of clarity applies, where the
retransmission is not wire-bound. Despite the fact, that the Directive also mentions
“microwaves”, it is not the prevailing opinion, that other forms of retransmission via air (e.g.
mobile telephony) are also covered by its scope. Once again, broadcasters have to face a
substantial lack of legal certainty.

When it comes to non-linear distribution of ARD’s online services via third party-platforms it
gets even more complicated. For example, cable-operators not only want to retransmit
broadcasters’ linear services, but also their accompanying audiovisual media services online,
such as the seven day catch-up. As is the case with cable-retransmission - here as well a
licensing of the complete mass of rights included in the services offered on demand is at
stake. So far, there is no regulatory support to tackle this issue. Hence, neither broadcasters
nor collecting societies or third platform operators are able to solve this problem in the
interest of their customers.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
   would be the best way to tackle them?

For broadcasters like ARD and its members which do not target audiences outside their
domestic country, the Cab/Sat-Directive provides a well functioning sector specific solution
for original linear satellite broadcasting as well as for cable retransmission.

By establishing the country of origin principle for satellite broadcasting, a very clear and
simple solution is provided. Only the right of the country where the uplink takes place is of
relevance. Such a legal determination of the applicable law has turned out to be the most
effective mechanism to solve all potential conflicts which might occur with respect to satellite
broadcasting and its overspill.

The interest of the rights owners is respected by recalling the need to take into account all
aspects of the distribution when it comes to negotiate the remuneration. By simply combining
these two elements (country of origin plus consideration of rights owners financial interests)
an important step forwards to an European wide reception area was made. It was never really
questioned by all stakeholders involved.

It seems to suggest itself to rely on the same approach with regard to simulcasting and
webcasting via the internet. As long as a broadcaster with its services targets its own national
audience, the reception outside the distribution area via the internet is only a kind of
“overspill”. The question of possible reception by customers outside the distribution area has
to be taken into account of course. However, the concrete arrangement of the contracts is left
to rights owners and broadcasters.


                                                                                              5
Furthermore, the provisions of cable retransmission in the Cab/Sat-Directive provide a very
useful model on how to tackle problems with respect to retransmission of linear services. In
light of the fast development of new technologies the Cab/Sat-Directive simply needs an
extension. The cable-regime under the Directive should be updated in a technologically-
neutral way to all forms of retransmission, whether or not wire-bound. This would lead to an
equal treatment of cable-operators on the one hand and operators of IP-TV or mobile TV-
platforms on the other.

Naturally, a solution is also needed for the on-demand services of broadcasters. As mentioned
before, they are closely related to the traditional broadcasting programmes and likewise
originally provided for the users in the broadcaster’s domestic country. A possible reception
from outside the distribution area should be considered as “overspill”. This aspect should be
taken into account within the contractual relationship between the broadcaster and the rights
owner. The concept of the applicable law as the one of the country of origin perfectly fits in
this case.

With regard to the problem of the licensing of broadcasters on–demand services by third party
platforms, extended collective licensing agreements could be a very useful tool. The concept
is recognized in article 9 (2) of the Cab/Sat-Directive and applied in several member states
(e.g. in the Nordic countries) and should be further promoted and recommended within
European copyright law. Extended collective licensing agreements are completely voluntary.
Rights holders not represented by the collecting society can decide to “opt out” from an
agreement. Hence, the principle of contractual freedom remains intact.


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
   solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
   services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
   holders?

X YES

See answer question 4


B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
   authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
   content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

X NO

See answer question 2




                                                                                            6
10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online
environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

X YES

Wherever two different kinds of rights are involved within a unique act of exploitation, legal
uncertainties and the risk of double payment occur. Public service broadcasters definitely
want to offer their services legally so that their audiences do not run the risk of infringing the
law by just watching these programme on their screen. However, for the time being it is left to
the jurisdiction to sharpen the scope of the making available right regarding incidental
reproductions. The district court of Munich held that copies occurring in the process of an
online streaming service are not of a separate economic relevance.

Therefore, the acquisition of the making available right is sufficient. In other words, the court
does not allow to split a single use into separate rights, if one right (right of reproduction) in
the given context is only relevant incidentally for the licensed use. It should be a general
principle, that wherever the reproduction right is only of ancillary nature, it should be covered
by the license of the main copyright relevant act. This should be made clear at least by a
“normative interpretation” by the EU-Commission.


11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
    under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
    authorisation of the rightholder?

X YES - for framing

X NO - for mere hyperlinking

Mere hyperlinking – as opposed to framing/embedding – to a work or other subject-matter
protected under copyright should not be subject to the authorisation of the rights holder. It
simply identifies the website where the protected content can be found and therefore functions
as a guidepost to that website. With good reason, the ECJ in the Svensson case recently found
that the making available of protected works by means of a hyperlink is not directed at a new
public and therefore does not constitute an “act of communication to the public”.

There is no need to converse the – therefore given – legality of hyperlinking by changing the
relevant EU provisions and introduce a right to prohibit hyperlinks. Hyperlinking is
indispensable for the functioning of the internet as a network and, due to the sheer amount of
hyperlinks to different kinds of protected content, it is practically impossible to build up a
licensing system for hyperlinks. Thus, the introduction of a right to prohibit hyperlinks would
have severe effects on the internet as it is today and, due to the importance of the internet in
daily life, would severely reduce general copyright acceptance by the public in the EU.

A different view has to be taken on acts of framing. Even if, from a technical point of view,
the framing of protected content is a special form of linking since the user technically obtains
the content from the original source, the effects of framing are fundamentally different than in
the case of mere hyperlinks. In many cases, the user will be misled about the actual source of
the content. For the framing website, framing has an advantage over hyperlinking: it keeps the
users at its own website instead of “losing” them to the website where the content is actually
                                                                                                7
made available. Therefore, framing opens up the possibility to build up new business models
solely based on other rights holders’ content.

For example, someone could build up a specific interest website (e.g. “the best documentaries
on the internet”) that only consists of framed documentaries from other websites surrounded
by advertisements. For the rights owners, the lawfulness of framing would not only mean that
their own editorial offers can be torn by anyone. It would also lead to the situation that they
have to pay presumably more for the rights (due to a higher number of page impressions) and,
in addition, have to bear the streaming costs although the user does not enter their own
website. From an economical point of view it is therefore indispensable for the rights owners
that framing is subject to their prior authorisation.

Framing should be covered by the right to communicate the work to the public since the
framing website has the fundamental role in communicating the protected work to the public,
the role of the website which hosts the protected content is basically reduced to a technical
tool for the framing website. If, in the pending Bestwater case, the ECJ extends its findings of
the Svensson case to the framing of audio and video content and holds that these acts of
framing also do not constitute an “act of communication to the public”, it would be
indispensable to change the relevant EU provisions and to make the framing of audio and
video content subject to prior authorisation of the rights holder. Framing should, if at all, only
be possible without prior authorisation in a purely non-commercial context under the
precondition that the source of the framed content is adequately indicated.


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
    work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
    memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
    subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

X NO

It is a common copyright principle that the reception of a broadcast is not a copyright relevant
act. The same should apply to the mere viewing of an on-demand service. The fact that, due to
technical circumstances, the viewing of the webpage implies the purely temporary
reproduction in the cache should not lead to a different classification. If the viewing of a
webpage were copyright relevant and not exempted by an exception, several problems would
arise. There would be a risk of a double payment for an unique act of exploitation (see also
answer to question 10). Moreover, it would shift a high and in many cases practically
impossible burden to the user to check the legitimacy of an on-demand offer before even
having accessed the website.
For example, if it happens to be that on trustworthy webpages (such as the webpage of official
institutions like the webpage of the Commission) a copyright infringing text is published, the
user would also violate the copyright by browsing the website and reading the text. Such a
situation for an activity which belongs to almost everyone’s daily life would raise severe
questions with regard to the general acceptance of copyright law.
Therefore, if the courts found the mere viewing of an on-demand service to be a copyright
relevant act that is not exempted by existing exceptions, a new exception needed to be
introduced.



                                                                                                8
C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

X NO


17.      What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

A registration system as a precondition for copyright protection will not only create additional
administrative burden for the owners of copyright, but also for users who have to trace
whether protection is still guaranteed or not. The approach in general will split copyright
owners in those who will make the effort to register and to invest in registration and those
who will not or cannot afford it. Finally, the question of equal treatment is at stake.


D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


19.      What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
      content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
      ownership and permissions databases?

ARD and its members believe that in principle identifiers in the content sector may be useful.
However, since they may be used for totally different purposes, it must be left to each single
production entity to decide for the most appropriate system for its own needs. For example, a
system designed for complete productions (e.g. ISAN) may not be an equally useful
instrument when it comes to mark individual contributions to a documentary production such
as photographs, excerpts or personal statements. Therefore, no mandatory implementation of
a certain system should be envisaged.


E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?


20.       Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
      environment?

X NO

Every extension of the term of protection of works under copyright reduces the scope of the
public domain. By reducing this “pool” of content available for the free use for consumers on
the internet, the possibilities to actively participate in any form of communication, e.g.
through the use of user generated content, is shrinking respectively.


                                                                                              9
The issue of the term of protection should also be seen together with the relatively low
requirements for works qualifying for copyright protection. Today it is often impossible to
even explain, why certain rights are provided at all, e.g. for a simple snapshot made with a
mobile phone. Since the acceptance of copyright in general is extremely “under pressure”, any
further prolongation of existing terms of protection would definitely be counterproductive.
Solely “piracy” would benefit.


   III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

X YES

The limitations and exceptions provided under national law are very important tools for
broadcasters to work with when it comes to the use of copyright protected content.
Broadcasters often need to work with copyright-protected content which might be important
for e.g. a critical documentary or news coverage. However, it might be possible that the rights
owner does not wish that this content is used in such a context.
Since it is impossible to check whether the conditions of a certain exception such as quotation
are fulfilled under the respective law of all 28 member states, this uncertainty also might lead
to the need to geo-block certain content.
Therefore, a clear rule regarding the applicable law (a country of origin) is the best and easiest
remedy to avoid such cases.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

X NO

See answer question 21


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

It should be clarified that the ephemeral reproductions exception in article 5 (2) (d) of the
Infosoc Directive also covers broadcasters online or on-demand services.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

X YES



                                                                                               10
The existing catalogue of exceptions and limitations does not yet reflect the further
development of the information society. It should be reviewed in the light of this
development, especially with a regard to the end-users’ needs to communicate via the internet
using protected content. For example, when they use protected content, such as excerpts of
audio/audiovisual content to work with for purposes like mashing-up, etc. this should be
allowed to a certain extent as long as it does not take place for commercial purposes.
Such an approach would certainly contribute to a better acceptance of copyright and could
avoid the criminalization of many – especially younger - users.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

In a first step, article 5 (3) (o) of the Infosoc Directive could be modified in a sense that the
words “certain other” and the words “they only concern analogue uses” are deleted. Such
modification could be a first step to open up the catalogue and to adapt existing exceptions
and limitations to the digital world without introducing the fair use principle. This approach
would also leave intact the three step test.


26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?

X YES

See answer question 21


A.     Access to content in libraries and archives


41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other
    types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

X NO

Broadcasters’ archives are production archives. They are established to collect audio and
audiovisual content necessary for the production of broadcasting programmes and therefore to
provide the material instantly and permanently for editorial purposes. So far, they are not
comparable e.g. to a library which is established to provide content for end-users directly.
Therefore, mechanisms comparable to those that have been established for libraries are not
helpful in general for broadcasters’ archives.

Broadcasters are facing a different problem. The use of their archive material in their non-
linear services is only possible, when rights clearance has taken place. Given the enormous

                                                                                              11
amount of audio and audiovisual material, photographs, etc. in broadcasters’ production
archives, rights clearance on an individual basis for making available archive content in non-
linear services is practically impossible.
Therefore, public service broadcasters are in need of a legislative solution at national level.
The ARD-members believe that extended collective licensing agreements might provide a
useful tool in this context. As mentioned above (see answer to question 4), a framework
provision on the EU level promoting this system would be very useful.


VII. A single EU Copyright Title

27.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

X NO


VIII. Other issues

28.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

In different contexts (e.g. HbbTV, retransmission via IP-TV) questions regarding the integrity
of the broadcasters’ signals arise. Sometimes commercial overlays are laid over the content,
sometimes they even suppress accompanying information such as subtitles for handicapped
people. This kind of interference undermines the credibility and reputation of broadcasters
like ARD. Ultimately, the freedom of information of the citizens and the protection of the
rights of others are at stake. For these reasons, ARD-members would like to ask to extend the
broadcasters’ neighbouring right in a way that the signal integrity is effectively guaranteed
against interference from third parties.
