   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

or under specific circumstances, and why

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for  the

    flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision  /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be  the  relative

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

    experienced specific  problems  when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
    preserve and archive specific works or  other  subject  matter  in  your

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32.  (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
    experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements  with

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36.  (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
    specific problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
    engage in mass digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
    management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact
    legislation to ensure  that  the  results  of  the  2011  MoU  (i.e. the
    agreements concluded between libraries and  collecting  societies)  have
    a cross-border effect so that out of  commerce  works  can  be  accessed

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  an  institutional
    user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to  use  works

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
    organisation  representing  persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
    application of the private copying and reprography exceptions[58] in the
    digital environment?

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
    resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy,
    or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
    mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you  receive  an
    adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation   of   your   works   and
    performances?

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
    efficient for infringements of copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
    purpose?

    commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster  the
    cooperation of intermediaries?

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
    as a means  of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
    exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for
    enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
    Does the current level of difference among the Member State  legislation
    mean that this is a longer term project?

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal  framework
    for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters  should  be
    addressed.

This response groups and replies to questions of general concern related  to
determining the future contours of EU legal framework for  copyright.  While
the present consultations are addressed to stakeholders,  one  of  the  main
objectives of this general response is to emphasise the  importance  of  the
substantial academic studies for a  balanced  reform  of  the  EU  copyright
rules and the implementation of a unitary copyright title.

While determining the future contours of copyright in  the  European  Union,
the Commission should consider carefully academic studies and  analysis.  In
this regard, one of the main objectives  of  this  general  response  is  to
emphasise the importance of the substantial academic  work  for  a  balanced
reform of the EU  copyright  rules  and  the  implementation  of  a  unitary
copyright title.

The public consultation initiated by the Commission on 5  December  2013  is
as indicated part of the Commission's efforts to  review  and  modernise  EU
copyright rules. In line with the aim  declared  by  the  consultation,  the
press release announcing its  publication  mentions  the  statement  of  the
Internal Market and Services Commissioner Michel Barnier, who confirmed  his
conception of copyright as  “a  modern  and  effective  tool  that  supports
creation and  innovation,  enables  access  to  quality  content,  including
across   borders,   encourages   investment   and    strengthens    cultural
diversity”.[68] The Commission endorses the words of the  Commissioner  when
it expresses the necessity of an EU copyright policy that keeps up with  the
times. It underlines, in the presentation  of  the  context  of  the  public
consultation, the changes brought over  the  last  two  decades  by  digital
technology and the Internet to the way “content”  is  created,  distributed,
and accessed. According to the Commission, the  notable  two  challenges  of
this new environment are, on the one hand, for the markets  to  continue  to
adapt to the new forms of distribution and use, and on the other  hand,  for
the legislator to guarantee that the system  of  copyright  protection,  the
limitations to copyright and its  enforcement  remains  appropriate  and  is
adapted to this new  environment.  The  Commission  also  expects  that  the
current consultation focuses on the second challenge.
      Indeed it is essential to consider  adaptations  or  modifications  of
copyright  rules  which  have  become  necessary  due   to   the   technical
developments prompting changes of business models, uses and needs.
      However,  considerations  on  the  adaptations  of  copyright   rules,
especially in the legal framework of the  European  Union,  presuppose  that
common objectives of copyright and a common definition  of  its  function(s)
are determined, and that furthermore, a balance of interests is guaranteed.
      For now,  these  determinations  are  lacking.  The  harmonisation  of
copyright, although significant,  has  been  nevertheless  limited.  If  the
Directive  2001/29  marks  an  essential  step  in  the  long   process   of
harmonisation, its limits explain the efforts undertaken by  the  Commission
to continue to strengthen harmonisation as  well  as  the  boldness  of  the
jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  in  the
creation of the unified understanding of copyright rules.
      While welcoming the efforts of the Commission to consult, it should be
noted that the multiplicity and  the  succession  since  2000  of  different
documents, programmes, working groups, communications and consultations  has
not  translated into sufficiently concrete results, in  order  to  meet  the
expectations  of economic actors and citizens in particular.  Moreover,  the
successive academic studies commissioned and produced in this  context  have
hardly had any effect. CEIPI can only  call  upon  the  Commission  to  give
greater consideration to such scientific studies. The  construction  of  the
EU  copyright,  harmonised  or   unified,   presupposes   some   fundamental
reflections, analysis and studies that only independent research  institutes
are able to provide.
      The  harmonisation  of  copyright  rules  is  necessary  and   the(ir)
unification appears to  be  an  ideal;  otherwise  the  development  of  the
European  Union  itself  would  be  called  into  question.  Currently,   EU
copyright  law  is  mainly  designed  by  the  CJUE[69],  and  although  its
intervention is with no doubt necessary and its interpretation  efforts  are
remarkable,  its  bold  jurisprudence  can  not  substitute  the   necessary
political and legal choices. The role  of  the  CJEU  is  without  doubt  to
oversee the implementation of the law of the  European  Union,  and  notably
the harmonising directives in  the  domain  of  copyright,  and  to  provide
uniform interpretation in  cases  of  contradictory,  imprecise  or  obscure
provisions. However, it is not its role to provide the harmonisation or  the
unification, which, if is  undoubtedly  missing,  was  neither  decided  nor
carried out by the Member States and  the  bodies  of  the  European  Union,
whose competence and legitimacy enable them to do so.  The  intervention  of
the Court should be welcomed, in particular to advance the  debate  as  well
as to fill some gaps, but its legitimacy to  undertake  the  unification  of
the EU copyright rules in the absence of a sufficient legislative  framework
is disputable.
      This unification of the  rules,  which  can  result  either  from  the
“integral” harmonisation or from the creation of a unitary  European  title,
should be initiated by the Commission and decided by the Member  States  and
their representatives in the  European  Parliament.  Only  this  legislative
intervention will give full legitimacy to the existence of copyright of  the
European Union.
      Such intervention presupposes an important  and  delicate  substantive
work. Compromise solutions have to  be  found  between  the  Member  States,
which have  different  legal  systems  and  copyright  traditions.  In  this
spirit, the Commission raised the question of the opportunity of  a  unitary
European title. Such an initiative should be welcomed since it can  mark  an
essential change in the process of elaboration of the  EU  copyright  rules.
CEIPI wishes to encourage this move  and  to  provide  its  support  in  the
delicate task that is awaiting the Commission and the European Parliament.
      In this context, and in light of the questionnaire  submitted  by  the
Commission in the framework of the public consultation, we believe  that  it
is important to emphasise:


The importance of the cultural, social and economic objectives of copyright

The cultural and social objectives of copyright presuppose  that  the  rules
of copyright both encourage the creation of works  and  their  dissemination
in a manner permitting access to them by the public[70], as well as  protect
the special connection that unites, in the domain of literary  and  artistic
works, the creative work and its author.
      From this point of view, it is essential that the author is recognized
as such and that the regime of copyright  is  constructed  in  a  way  which
protects his legitimate interests (notably his moral interests) with  regard
to the protection of his work.
      Although creators, like  other  actors  of  the  digital  market,  are
addressed by the questionnaire of the consultation and can  respond  to  it,
they  seem  to  be  almost  absent  from  the  document  published  by   the
Commission. The figure of the author, like the notion of a  work,  tends  to
disappear from proposed texts off the Commission.  Of  course,  the  digital
environment is special and this explains an evolution  of  business  models,
uses, etc. but in our  view  it  does  not  justify  that  the  consultation
document mainly refers to “content” and  “content  producers”,  and  not  to
creators or creative works.
       It is to be welcomed that  the  aim  of  the  promotion  of  cultural
diversity is affirmed, but the cultural objective of copyright  goes  beyond
this. The copyright regime from this perspective  is  intimately  linked  to
the financing of creation. National particularities are important from  this
point of view and it seems that the establishment  of  a  common  regime  of
copyright cannot be considered in an isolated manner,  without  taking  into
account the means to finance creativity.
      The economic objective of copyright implies that the author of a  work
can obtain legitimate remuneration for the use of  his  work  and  that  the
actors enabling its distribution are encouraged to  do  so  and  can  obtain
some legitimate revenue from the use of the work.
      In this spirit, the  Commission  also  considers  the  opportunity  to
establish  a  harmonized/unified  framework  for  copyright  contracts.   It
appears to us that the elaboration of  such  a  framework,  even  if  it  is
difficult to implement at this moment due to  the  different  traditions  of
the Member States, is certainly necessary in order to guarantee  creators  a
fair distribution of revenues generated by the exploitation of their  works.


The importance of a right that secures remuneration of authors

The Commission’s objective of promoting and enhancing the development  of  a
single digital market is laudable. Copyright, in its economic dimension,  is
an important aspect  of  the  single  market;  therefore,  the  Commission’s
inquiry into the appropriateness of the legal  framework  in  the  field  of
copyright is legitimate and timely. In order to realise the  full  potential
of  the  digital  single  market,  adapting  the  Union  rules  relating  to
copyright is certainly necessary.
      It is essential that enforcement of copyright not become  an  obstacle
to  the  effective  exploitation  of  works.  Copyright  law  must,  on  the
contrary,  enhance  use  of  works,  and  ensure  that  authors   have   the
possibility to receive remuneration when their work is being  exploited.  It
is critically important to make sure that copyright law does  not  make  the
use of works – i.e., the public’s access  to  works  -  impossible  or  very
difficult.
      On the one hand, economic studies, in particular those carried out  by
independent  university  centres,  are  necessary   to   identify   possible
difficulties, changes in business models relating to the development of  the
digital  market,  as  well  as  innovative  business  models.  Knowledge  of
business realities and their possible development would allow  for  informed
adoption of rules that are appropriate for the  digital  environment.  These
rules will derive from policy choices which need to be made; as long as  the
specificity of the digital environment is considered thoroughly.
      On the other hand, legal studies are necessary in advance in order  to
suggest how the legal framework could develop.  The  Commission  asks  about
difficulties related to  the  fact  that  various  rights  are  involved  in
digital transmissions, about uncertainties  related  to  the  definition  of
rights, about difficulties related to differing  national  definitions,  and
to the territoriality of rights.
      It is certainly  useful  to  know  stakeholders’  positions  on  these
questions; however, independent research is also indispensable. Indeed,  the
difficulties related to the  application  of  rules  defining  the  author’s
rights need to be clearly identified. It is crucial not to establish a  less
protective system, or rules which offer less  protection  to  authors  where
the  provisions  currently  applicable  allow  exploitation  of  works   and
remuneration of authors and legitimate right holders. Equally, the  practice
of neighbouring rights, as well as the question of  their  coexistence  with
copyright, also needs to be adressed.

The importance of a balanced copyright law

Copyright  law’s  cultural,  social  and  economic  objectives  imply   that
copyright must be balanced. It is crucial that a fair balance  of  interests
be ensured. ‘Balance’ does not necessarily refer to  equal  weight:  but  in
any case, a justified and legitimate weighting  is  necessary,  which  might
differ depending on the justification underlying the rule.
      Legislative intervention is necessary in order to define  the  balance
to be preserved within copyright law. Balance is the result of  the  rights’
definition – both positive and negative,  i.e.,  by  clarifying  limitations
and exceptions as well as the term of protection.
      As to limitations and exceptions, CEIPI responded to the Green Book on
‘Copyright in the Knowledge Economy’  published  in  2008  by  the  European
Commission.[71] CEIPI highlighted the importance of  true  harmonisation  of
national laws and made some recommendations;  attention  was  drawn  to  the
importance of declaring that limitations and  exceptions  justified  by  the
public interest be  mandatory.[72]  The  Commission  itself  emphasised  the
urgency of addressing the  question  of  exceptions  and  limitations.  This
urgency  of  a  more  substantial   review   probably   explains   why   the
questionnaire of the public  consultation  of  5  December,  2013  was  only
published in English. It is certainly still  useful  to  inquire,  with  new
questions, into the issue of exceptions and limitation; yet,  it  should  be
noted that, besides CJEU case-law, no measure has  been  adopted  more  than
five years after the Green Book. ‘Legislative’ intervention  would  at  this
point not only be welcomed, but is absolutely necessary.
      Legislative intervention would be more critical concerning the term of
protection, another element of balance. Member States  and  the  Union  must
respect obligations deriving from international conventions.
      It is, nonetheless, important to emphasise that the term of protection
of economic rights of 70 years post mortem is long and should certainly  not
be extended any further [73]; it is  not  appropriate  for  certain  digital
works such as software or databases. Moreover, the  term  of  protection  of
neighbouring rights is excessive  –  except  considering  the  situation  of
performing artists.[74] In our view, the term  of  copyright  protection  in
the EU must be reconsidered. Besides, it should be remembered that –  within
the limits of the Union’s and the Member States’  international  obligations
– there are  alternatives  to  a  long  term  of  protection.  It  would  be
appropriate to study alternative ways of securing  efficient  protection  of
the creators’ interests; one  possibility  would  be  to  foresee  that  the
author/creator may, if the right holder has not exploited the work during  a
certain period of time,  exploit  his/her  work  once  again;  the  term  of
protection could also be reduced in order to  establish  a  ‘domaine  public
payant’.
      The discussion about the term of protection leads to  the  distinction
between different objects of protection. Yet, the definition of  the  object
of protection will be a crucial question with a view to total  harmonisation
of copyright law or to the creation of a unitary copyright title.


A turning point in the construction of  a  copyright  law  of  the  European
Union: towards a unitary copyright title

The creation of a unitary EU copyright title is the crucial question  raised
by the consultation. The Commission thus clearly identifies the ideal to  be
attained. For years, CEIPI has been educating professionals in the field  of
European patent law, and to research  concerning  IP  law  in  the  European
Union. CEIPI consider that its mission is to educate European students  with
a view to promoting the emergence of a true European  intellectual  property
law.
      Convinced of the need for change in the process of construction of  an
EU copyright law, CEIPI’s members can only welcome  the  Commission’s  brave
proposition. Unless calling into question the European construction  itself,
the creation of a unitary EU title in the field of  copyright  law  must  be
contemplated and prepared. It is a priority.
      The  opportunity  of  creating  a  unitary  copyright  title  must  be
discussed from a political point of  view.  From  a  legal  point  of  view,
thorough studies  and  analyses  must  now  be  carried  out,  and  concrete
solutions must be suggested. The issue is delicate and  a  compromise  needs
to be found: conditions  of  unification  must  urgently  be  studied  in  a
precise manner. Independent copyright experts should be entrusted with  this
task in advance, so as to identify substantive aspects of  an  EU  copyright
title. In this perspective, the object of  rights  and  the  conditions  for
access to protection, the content of rights and  limitations,  the  term  of
protection, as well  as  appropriate  and  balanced  sanctions  need  to  be
defined. In developing autonomous  concepts  of  Union  law,  the  Court  of
Justice has attempted to define certain common aspects of copyright law;  it
is now up  to  the  EU  institutions  in  their  legislative  role,  at  the
initiative of  the  Commission,  to  adopt  a  proper  legal  framework  for
copyright in the information society.

of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses

[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the

where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
