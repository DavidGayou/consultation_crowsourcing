     I. Introduction
A.      Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

           Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
           Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for
musical works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film
or record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

ANSWER: When an author creates a work, he has exclusive rights over it, without borders.
He can then, in principle, licence the exploitation of the work without borders too. However, in
the EU’s audiovisual sector, it is usual practice for authors to assign their rights for the whole
world to the producer who finances the film. They expect their works to be exploited globally
via the producer who can license the exploitation rights for various modes of exploitation and
territories. The trouble is that audiovisual authors are neither able to control the distribution of
their works nor their capacity to enforce the agreements they signed and to be remunerated
for the exploitation of their works.
The reality of the European film and audiovisual sector is therefore that it is fragmented into
several markets based on languages and types of exploitation of the works. Indeed, most
audiovisual media services, including online, target specific markets. These services
therefore do not request multi-territorial licences.
As far as multi-territorial online services are concerned, one can distinguish two categories:
   -   Online services that are operated by traditional players as a complement to their
       offline activities (broadcasters, telecom operators, cable operators). Licences for
       these online services are usually dealt with as an extension of their licences for offline
       activities. The multi-territorial dimension is usually limited to some public service
       broadcasters willing to be available for their nationals living abroad.

   -   Online services operated by pure internet players such as iTunes, Netflix, LoveFilm
       (Amazon), MUBI, YouTube, Dailymotion, etc. (OTT services). These services are
       available in several European countries but most of them reached their actual scope
       through country by country development and continue to operate on this basis. They
       tend to provide localised versions of their services in each market which are not
       available cross-border. In theory, they could be interested in multi-territorial licences,
       but in practice, our experience is that this is not the case.
Because there is no harmonisation of the intervention of collective rights management
organisations in the audiovisual sector, in particular for authors’ rights, only a few audiovisual
authors’ CMOs (in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland) are able to clear online
rights for their repertoire. In other countries, online rights are individually managed.
For instance, audiovisual authors’ CMOs want their works (screenwriters and directors) to be
widely accessible on online services. For this purpose, they established at the end of 2011 a
working group called FRAME to develop a multi-territorial online offer for digital service
providers (DSPs) active in more than one European country. Their objective was to offer a
multi-territorial agreement for the use of their aggregated repertoires and to license every
European platform operator under the same conditions and under strict application of the
principle of equal treatment. All platforms would get access to the FRAME repertoire,
whether they exploit it in all of the countries or only in some. The remuneration would be
calculated according to the principle of the country of destination.
15 audiovisual authors’ CMOs cooperated in the FRAME project to develop such a model
that would ensure the collection and distribution of audiovisual authors’ remuneration for the
online exploitation of their works. In doing so, they were faced with three main obstacles:
       1/ Only a few audiovisual authors’ CMOs are today entitled to clear the online rights
       for their repertoire. This considerably reduces the interest for DSPs of such a multi-
       territorial licence. This lack of harmonisation of the intervention of audiovisual authors’
       CMOs is an obstacle to pan-European online rights clearance for European
       audiovisual works.
       2/ Competition issues: the Commission is unclear about the cooperation possibilities
       between CMOs and usually prefers to encourage competition. Via the FRAME
       working group, audiovisual authors’ CMOs worked together to try to create a very
       simple, easy-to-use portal, which would have been helpful to both authors, DSPs and
                                                                                                  9
       ultimately consumers. However, EU competition rules jeopardize the achievement of
       this project by requiring that CMOs compete rather than cooperate.
       3/ Double taxation of royalties: there is no harmonisation of the tax treatment of
       cross-border royalty payments between Member States. If CMOs from different
       Member States develop a common licensing platform, they expose their members to
       an additional layer of withholding tax that can reach an overall taxation of 60%.
These problems have to be addressed urgently if the Commission does not want audiovisual
authors to be left behind the Internal Market with only some of them being remunerated for
the online exploitation of their works.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
ANSWER :
1/ The lack of a harmonised framework for audiovisual authors’ remuneration makes it
impossible for their CMOs to offer DSPs pan-European licences. There is therefore an urgent
need to provide audiovisual authors with a harmonised guarantee of remuneration for the
online exploitation of their works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This should take the
form of an unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration (see answers to questions about
fair remuneration of authors and performers), enforced through a scheme where CMOs are
entrusted to collect the remuneration at the level of the final distributors.
In the audiovisual sector, after the initial transfer of the authors’ making available right to the
producer, this right is very often split territorially and transferred again and again to many
different operators such as sale agents, distributors, broadcasters, etc. . The contractual
chain back to authors is then so long, complex and easily broken if one element of the chain
experience difficulties (e.g. an intermediary going out of business) that the authors rarely see
a cent of any remuneration linked to the exploitation of the work.
Collective management of the right to remuneration should therefore be encouraged so
as to guarantee that the online exploitation of audiovisual works will benefit their authors and
be helpful to users who will know who to get the licences from.
2/ Cooperation between audiovisual authors’ CMOs should be encouraged to develop pan-
European licences.
In this context, as SAA, we welcome the 12 April 2013 CJEU judgments (here) against the
Commission’s decision in the CISAC case in which the Court concluded that the Commission
had not adduced sufficient evidence of a concerted practice between CISAC societies. The
Court suggested, among others, that cooperation between societies as regards effective
monitoring and enforcement against unauthorised exploitation cannot work if these societies
also compete in licensing.
3/ Another major problem in facilitating cross-border licensing of works is the way in which
the system of tax treaties operates in Europe. The tax system on royalties makes it extremely
complex to develop initiatives such as FRAME as it remains within the scope of the network
of different double tax treaties. This raises three specific issues:
   -   Different rates, required documentation and conditions are attached to each treaty;
   -   Complex to operate and resolve problems: issues have to be addressed directly to
       the tax authorities in other countries rather than centrally. Response times can be
       very slow;

                                                                                                10
   -   The administration of tax returns for individuals who receive royalties from foreign
       societies can be very complex.
There is an urgent need for the Commission to come up with a fair answer on this issue of
double-tax treaties in order to facilitate cross border availability of works.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
Due to the European coproduction framework, the coproduction and financing agreements
between coproducers impose windows of exploitation based upon territorial licensing and
means of exploitation. So there is not service providers acting only on an European level but
several media service providers acting through linear and non linear media services and off-
line services such as cinemas and DVD publishers acting on different level participating in the
spread of cultural diversity.
For instance, in a French-Belgium coproduction deal, in consideration of the financing of the
Film, a Belgian Television may negotiate priority of the broadcasting of the audiovisual work
on its territory through its own channels with French producers and broadcasters operating
also indirectly on its territory. This exclusivity is essential for the financing of the audiovisual
work. One can however says that such an exclusivity must be limited in time to allow wider
spread of the work, without, however,t jeopardizing the production of film.
The same principle may be applied to the different means of exploitation of a work: a set of
exclusivities between cinemas, pay TV, free TV, VOD, SVOD, ... services.
The audiovisual sector commands to be adapted to tackle new challenges but also improve
cultural diversity in accordance with the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the
Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005..




6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
YES - Please explain
Legislative solutions:
European legislation is needed to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated with
unwaivable rights to remuneration (as the recent study by KEAN Partners and Crids on
the “Contractual arrangements applicable to creators: Law and practice in selected member
states recommands16) for the online distribution of their works, independently of the country
of production and exploitation by all the editors and distributors of linear and non linear
services of audiovisual works, whatever technology used. With such a level playing field,
authors’ collective management organisations, entrusted to manage the making available
remuneration of audiovisual authors could develop one-stop-shops to offer a single licence or
entry point to online operators, while allowing producers to distribute in the most appropriate
manner their audiovisual productions. This will, in turn, make it easier for them to pay the
remuneration due to the European audiovisual authors of the works in their catalogue. This
must be a priority for the Commission to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for
the on-demand exploitation of their works whatever the country of exploitation (please see
details in our responses to Q.72-74 below).
In the digital age, there are so many opportunities to make works available to audiences that
there is no excuse for a lack of effort by producers and their distributors in exploiting works
within their control. An obligation of exploitation of the rights held (use it or lose it principle)
should be introduced to generate a strong incentive for these operators to make the works
available (as the recent study by KEAN Partners and Crids on the “Contractual arrangements
applicable to creators: Law and practice in selected member states recommands17). If there
has been no exploitation of a work for a period of time, then the authors’ rights revert back to
them and they can exploit their rights themselves. This would also help unlock cultural
heritage works.

Finally, a reduced VAT rate for on-demand audiovisual works is a necessity for the
development and take-up of online services: only cinema tickets and broadcasting currently
benefit from a reduced VAT rate so far. When delivering the same audiovisual works on VOD
and catch-up TV (and on DVD), audiovisual media services cannot apply a consistent
reduced VAT rate. It is essential to allow Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate for all
audiovisual works independently of their delivery method and in particular in the online
environment. Such a reduced rate would boost the online market twofold: by competing on
price with physical products and by drawing consumers away from illegal services.
Non-legislative solutions/market-led solutions:
Market-led solutions already exist and will continue to develop. As underlined at the plenary
of the Licences for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue on 13 November 2013, in the Joint
Statement on “Cross-border Portability of lawfully-acquired content” of the audiovisual
subgroup of Working Group 1, “market-led initiatives are already a reality in addressing
demand for away-from-home consumption of different types of content, including a growing
number of innovative consumer options” (see for example EuroVoD’s statement on the
cross-border access of subscription VoD offers, as well as the availability of several language
versions, in accordance with granted rights).

     -   In addition, [as provided in the SAA’s response to Q.1 of the 2011 Commission Green
         Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works,] here are some additional leads
         to help market operators address the digital single market for audiovisual works:
     -   Fight against piracy: legal platforms can only develop if illegal consumption of
         audiovisual works is countered. Some Members States (France, the UK and Spain for
         example) have taken action to address this problem, but they will necessarily have to
         be comforted and complemented by European initiatives in the context of a revision
         of the 2004 IPR enforcement Directive (see SAA’s contribution to the 2004/48
         Directive consultation).
     -   Distributors of audiovisual works could experiment new distribution schemes based
         on language versions instead of territories, as is the case in the book sector. This
         could help the multi-territorial online distribution of audiovisual works.


This must be achieved with the goal to preserve the multiterritorial financing structures of
audiovisual works productions.
Finally, the freedom to provide cross-border services set out in Article 56 TFEU is a
fundamental freedom which is central to the effective functioning of the EU internal market.
However, a freedom is not an obligation. For commercial operators, it has to correspond to a
market demand.
To assess this market demand, the European Commission commissioned a report by Plum
Consulting in March 2012 on the economic potential of cross-border pay-to-view and listen
audiovisual media services. This report identified 3 types of population group that may be
interested in cross-border audiovisual media services: migrant populations, people with
proficiency in or learning non-national languages and people travelling within the EU. The
report estimated the potential consumer demand for pay-to-view cross border audiovisual
services of between €760 million and €1,610 million annually in the EU. This compares to a
total EU pay-TV market size of €28.6 billion in 2009.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC18 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this



18
        Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the
harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                             13
     field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
     software19 and databases20.
     Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders21 which
     are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
     protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
     networks.
     The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
     authorise or prohibit the making of copies22, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
     e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
     at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
     communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
     dissemination of the works in digital networks23. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
     transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.   The act of “making available”
     Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
     upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
     “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
     territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
     need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
     only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
     countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
     Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
     a certain Member State's public24. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
     (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
     service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
     country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
     a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
     8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
     content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
              NO
     The scope of the making available right is clear enough from a practical point of view.

     19
               Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal
     protection of computer programs.
     20
               Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases.
     21
               Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights”
     in, respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
     referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
     matter”.
     22
               The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any
     means and in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of
     reproduction of a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive
     2001/29/EC).
     23
               The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to
     authorise or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
     24
               See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for
     copyright and related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction
     see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
     Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                                     14
However, the making available right itself should be clarified by introducing an unwaivable
right of authors to remuneration for their making available right, even when exclusive rights
have been transferred, so that authors are guaranteed a financial reward proportional to the
real exploitation of their works (please see details in our response to Qs. 72-74 below).
Otherwise this right is bought out by producers and no value is received by the authors.
In addition, [as stated in its reply to Q.5 of the 2011 Commission Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works] on whether to apply the country of origin principle as
applied to satellite broadcasting to online audiovisual media services, the 2001 Copyright
Directive did not transpose the exhaustion principle applicable to satellite broadcasting to the
making available right. On the contrary, Article 3 of the Directive expressly provides authors
with “the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public of their
works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works
in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.”
As SAA, we are therefore not in favour of the exhaustion of the making available right. It
would run against international treaties as it would deprive authors from an essential element
of their exclusive making available right. What was acceptable for satellite broadcasting, due
to its limited impact, in 1993 and still today, would override basic principles of copyright
protection when it comes to online transmissions as they already are, and will continue to be,
an increasingly important mode of transmission of works.
It therefore appears that the “country of origin approach” is not a good proposal for the future.
The recent study by De Wolf & Partners on the application of the Copyright Directive (p179-
180 and 182-184) confirmed that the country of origin approach is not appropriate as it does
not resolve any of the problems identified and would lead to “forum shopping” to find the
most favourable regimes and may also affect the european structures of financing the
audiovisual works.
It is better to recommend that online audiovisual media services work more with rightholders
at the origin of the production and distribution of works in order to secure online exploitation
rights for cross-border services.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief25)?


NO
As written by SAA, MdA does not think that a clarification of the territorial scope of the
making available right would have any impact on the recognition of the authors’ rights, the
possible transfer of rights and their remuneration. These issues are mainly dealt with in
legislation and authors’ contracts. The only way to address the current problems related to
these issues is to tackle them directly through harmonization and improvements of the
effective contractual bargaining power of Authors, as above mentionned and not through the
territorial scope of the making available right.
The recent study by De Wolf & Partners on the application of the Copyright Directive
underlined that “the territoriality principle (that the national legislator is competent to regulate

25
          Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                        15
     events occurring on the national territory in copyright terms) was examined but has not been
     challenged, even after several international and European initiatives to harmonise copyright
     protection.” What is important is the act/criteria that “triggers the territoriality” as shown
     throughout the CJEU’s decisions (conclusions on the territoriality of the making available
     right on p.176).

2.   Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
     Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
     law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
     transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
     licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
     persons/entities.

     10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
     rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
     create problems for you?
             NO
             In the audiovisual sector, there is no dichotomy since both sets of rights (reproduction
             right and making available right) are usually managed by the same entities, for
             instance CMO’s to whom authors assign their rights of reproduction and
             communication to the public.




3.   Linking and browsing
     Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
     They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
     pending before the CJEU26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
     a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
     public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
     A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
     works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
     memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU27 as to whether such
     copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
     provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

     11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
     protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
     the authorisation of the rightholder?
             YES – Please explain



     26
               Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)          and C-279/13 (C More
     entertainment).
     27
               Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See also
     http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

                                                                                                       16
              The provision of a hyperlink can encompass many indexing methods such as access,
              framing or embedding. A hyperlink is not however a mere digital reference which only
              gives information on a content like a footnote; it gives access to the content, it makes
              it available to the public.
              In principle, the provision of a hyperlink should therefore require an authorisation.
              This is particularly true for ‘embedded’ or ‘framed’ links within websites (to legal and
              illegal sources), especially if there is commercial gain. In the case of embedded and
              framed links, the digital service operator is considered as an organisation which
              “intervenes, in full knowledge of the consequences of its actions, to give access to the
              protected work to its customers” (CJEU, 7 December 2006, C-306/05 (Rafael
              Hoteles) para. 42). Providing a hyperlink to a protected work whose communication to
              the public has not been authorised is clearly a copyright infringement.
              The notion of “new public” used by the EUCJ in the case Svensson v Retriever
              Sverige         AB case seems to be inadequate for such an exploitation and would
              therefore affect       the development of site proposing original content. The Court
              did not take into real consideration the exploitation's economic value of hyperlink
              and therefore prejudice       for the original site.

              12 Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction
          of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the
          cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
          circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? YES – Please explain
              From the consumer’s perspective, pure viewing does not need the authorisation of
              the rightholder since temporary reproductions are covered under a mandatory
              copyright exception. However, it does not mean that streaming services do not need
              an authorisation. As any other on-demand service, streaming services of audiovisual
              protected works need an authorisation for the making available of works to the public.
              In addition, when the reproduction comes from an obviously illegal platform, the
              temporary reproduction should be prohibited (as per the ruling in the kino.to case in
              Germany where the notorious German streaming portal site offering links to illegal
              films and TV series was shut down and the people behind the portal prosecuted).

4.   Download to own digital content
     Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
     Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
     (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
     distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
     article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
     distribution of that tangible article)28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
     also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
     (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)29. This raises difficult questions,
     notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers

     28
               See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
     29
               In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a
     second-hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an
     unlimited period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a
     licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
     exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was
     careful to emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that
     this exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
     56).

                                                                                                                      17
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Answer: Providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital
content would raise more problems than it solves. One of the most important problems would
be to ensure that no copy of the work purchased is kept by the first owner. The new ‘forward
and delete’ technology (which erases the first copy from the seller’s hard drive) could be
seen as a solution to push for the establishment of such a legal framework. However, a
number of other issues would have to be carefully considered. For example, whether
rightholders would be ensured a fair proportion from the proceeds from re-sales, whether it
would be feasible to obtain rightholders’ authorisation for each act of resale, whether the first
sale doctrine should apply in the digital context to content other than software, the meaning
of a “copy” for copyright purposes (i.e. if the new copy made on the reseller platform amounts
to an infringement of the reproduction right), etc.
In addition, exhaustion is not the way to deal with the possible resale of digital files. The
current Copyright Directive does not allow the application of the exhaustion principle to
intangible goods (Recital 29 and Art 4(2)). Accordingly, sellers must obtain copyright holders’
approval before any act of resale and the resale market is prevented from having a
detrimental impact on the primary market of the goods in question. That was the conclusion
of the judge in a German ruling on downloads of ebooks and audiobooks and in a US case
(‘ReDigi’) on digital music resales where the Court judged that the First sale doctrine (namely
the exhaustion of rights) could only be applied to material item for the following reasons:
[p]hysical copies of works degrade with time and use, making used copies less desirable than new
ones. Digital information does not degrade, and can be reproduced perfectly on a recipient’s
computer. The “used” copy is just as desirable as (in fact, is indistinguishable from) space, effort
and cost no longer act as barriers to the movement of copies, since digital copies can be
transmitted nearly instantaneously anywhere in the world with minimal effort and negligible cost.
The need to transport physical copies of works, which acts as a natural brake on the effect of
resales on the copyright owner’s market, no longer exists in the realm of digital transmissions.
The ability of such “used” copies to compete for market share with new copies is thus far greater
in the digital world.
. The German court reiterated that the CJEU in the ‘UsedSoft’ case (C-128/11) considered
that the reasoning applicable to software (to which digital exhaustion applied) in that case
was a special case which applies when the Software Directive applies but is not applicable to
other digital content.


                                                                                                 18
C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered31.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
NO

17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Answer : It is unclear from the questionnaire whether such a registration system would be
voluntary or obligatory, public (like the RPCA in France, ‘le registre public du cinéma et de
l’audiovisuel’) or private and what rights it would grant, i.e. whether it is a register which
simply keeps a record of works, of their original rightholders, of the licensees according to
concluded contracts or grants copyright protection (and perhaps even different levels of
protection).
The Mda would only be interested in a model which would keep a record of the contractual
chain (which does not exist today on an european level), not in a system that would run
against the Berne formality prohibition. It would affect the exercice of rights of rightholders by
imposing burdensome procedures of registration and therefore their freedom of expression.
However, setting up such a registration system would be extremely costly (a massive drain
on the resources of all involved), time consuming and would likely never be reliable since it
would constantly have to be kept up-to-date. The MdA thinks it would be a much more
effective idea to link all the existing databases that are currently being developed by creating
a type of ARROW project for the audiovisual sector. Such a tool would be articulated around
ISAN, the international audiovisual works’ identifier which is already used by audiovisual
authors’ CMOs (see answer to Q.19).


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
30
          For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
          On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently
being set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             19

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub35 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
During the Licences for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue, the SAA was heavily involved in the
work of the Working Group on Audiovisual heritage and was one the initiators of the
Declaration on audiovisual work identifiers which was presented at the plenary meeting on
13 November 2013. The Declaration recognised that 1) “common use of standard and
interoperable audiovisual work identifiers would facilitate the process of rights clearance,
distribution for online availability, and discoverability of European works” and 2) “such
identifiers should notably be implemented for all new European works that are produced to
facilitate rights management, digital distribution, and discoverability”.
[As stated in the SAA’s response to Q.9 of the 2011 Commission Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works] In a world of multiple exploitations of audiovisual works on
different media in different countries, work identification systems are an absolute necessity.
This is why audiovisual authors’ collective management organisations collaborated on the
development of ISAN, the International Standard Audiovisual Number. It is a voluntary
numbering system and metadata scheme enabling the identification of any audiovisual work,
including films, shorts, documentaries, television programs and their related versions. ISAN
provides a unique, internationally recognised and permanent reference number for each

32
          E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

piece of audiovisual content registered. ISAN is being used in production and distribution
systems and to drive broadcast transmission systems (e.g. ITV in the UK), facilitating
interoperability and information exchange that contributes to improving rights management.
ISAN is key to content tracking and monitoring, and has been integrated in several
watermarking and fingerprinting technologies.
Collective management of rights relies on identification systems and databases. ISAN is
being integrated into the databases of audiovisual authors’ CMOs containing information on
the works, their authors and other rights holders. Audiovisual authors’ CMOs have also
developed IDA (International Documentation on Audiovisual Works), a worldwide centralised
database for audiovisual works that contains accurate information on audiovisual works and
their rights owners. This global database manages original productions, versions and
adaptations in other languages and formats. Each work registration contains a minimum set
of information: original titles, foreign titles, subtitles, production companies, year and country
of production, shooting languages, ISAN number, a unique IDA code, as well as detailed
information on rights owners such as their name, their international identifier (IPI -Interested
Party Information) and their respective share in the work.
The audiovisual authors’ CMOs use IDA to identify foreign audiovisual production and rights-
owners before distributing the royalties to the relevant identified sister organisations. The
sister organisation itself will transfer these royalties to their authors. The unique IDA code is
used between CMOs when exchanging information on an audiovisual work. Before IDA,
authors’ CMOs sent requests by e-mail or mail to sister societies, meaning paperwork and
rather long identification processes. IDA facilitates their identification and the exchange of
documentation between CMOs and accelerates the transfer of payments between CMOs.
Such a centralised system is built for the specific needs of audiovisual authors’ CMOs; IDA
references are non-public identifiers but the database is interoperable with existing tools
such as ISAN. IDA is a CISAC tool (the International Confederation of Societies of Authors
and Composers) and is a part of the CISAC Professional Rules and the Binding Resolutions
for audiovisual authors’ CMOs, rules that aim to improve transparency and quality of service
for all CISAC members.
ISAN being the bridge between IDA and third parties such as broadcasters, VOD platforms
and any other possible users of audiovisual works, a wider use of ISAN by these users in the
usage data reports they send to CMOs, combined with the use of the IDA centralised
database, is the key to faster identification of foreign works and payment to authors by their
CMOs. Any action from the Commission to generalise and accelerate the use of this
standard by all users of audiovisual works would be welcome.
What might also be lacking today is a portal giving some public information and visibility to
these tools and how they work together. The European Union could help in building such a
portal.
Finally, and as mentioned in our answer to Q.17, we are ready to examine how our
databases and others could be linked to ensure that more works are made publicly
accessible and to help the discoverability of works.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.


36
         Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

                                                                                               21
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
Yes - Please explain
The 1993 Directive harmonising the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights
recalled that the Berne Convention lays down only minimum terms of protection, leaving
Contracting States free to grant longer terms (recital 1). As certain Member States had
exercised this entitlement, the resulting differences between national laws were considered
as distorting competition in the internal market which justified harmonisation so as to make
terms of protection identical throughout the Community (recital 2).
The Directive recalls that the minimum term of protection laid down by the Berne Convention
(life of the author and 50 years after his death) was intended to provide protection for the
author and the first two generations of his descendants and considered that the average
lifespan in the Community had increased, to the point where this term was no longer
sufficient to cover two generations (recital 5). Therefore, in order to establish a high level of
protection, which at the same time meets the requirements of the internal market and the
need to establish a legal environment conducive to the harmonious development of literary
and artistic creation in the Community (recital 11), the Directive harmonised the term of
protection for copyright at 70 years after the death of the author.
Therefore, apart from harmonisation, the main reason for the extension of the term of
protection from 50 to 70 years was the extension of the average lifespan in Europe. We do
not see any reason linked to the digital environment that would question this extension.

       – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC37.




37
          Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal
protection of computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                     22
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")41.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.




38
          Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article
13 of the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO
Performers and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
39
          Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in
Member States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
40
          With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
41
          Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to
copyright and related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been
given a cross-border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is
considered an orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all
Member States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                              23
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
       NO - Please explain
       There is no problem with the fact that most exceptions provided in EU copyright
       directives are optional for the Member States. The list of exceptions of the
       2001/29/EC Directive is very long and encompasses all possible exceptions in the
       EU, but not for direct implementation by all Member States. Making this list
       mandatory would severely undermine the protection of authors’ rights. It must also be
       taken into account that some of the exceptions provided by the non-mandatory list
       are deeply embedded in the cultural framework of some countries, while not in others,
       involving public aids for creation of work.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
       NO - Please explain
       There is no general need for a higher level of harmonisation of the closed-list of
       exceptions and limitations of the Copyright Directive. As stated in recital 31, the
       degree of harmonisation of exceptions and limitations should be based on their
       impact on the smooth functioning of the internal market (last sentence). Neither the
       Commission nor the De Wolf study on the application of the Copyright Directive
       demonstrate such an impact in respect of any of the exceptions studied.
       The only exception with a potential impact on the smooth functioning of the internal
       market is according to us the private copying exception which is accompanied by fair
       compensation systems. We therefore propose that the private copying exception and
       its fair compensation system be further harmonised (see answer to Q. 64 and
       subsequent on private copying).


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
       We are not not in favour of any additional exceptions to the long list of exceptions in
       the 2001 Copyright Directive. This view is supported by the study by De Wolf &
       Partners on the application of the Copyright Directive.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
        – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO
The optionality of exceptions and limitations in the closed-list of the Copyright Directive
provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. Further flexibility in this area would lead to more
ambiguity and less certainty with respect to the scope of permitted acts.

The MdA particularly opposes the introduction of a “fair use” provision in the EU since it is
not adapted to EU law and provides no legal certainty as issues can only be resolved in front
of the courts. What is more, the study by De Wolf & Partners on the application of the


                                                                                                 24
Copyright Directive (p. 403) does not support introducing a general provision of fair use in EU
copyright law.

The May 2011 Hargreaves report in the UK supports our view. It stated on page 5 that “The
Review considered whether the more comprehensive American approach to copyright
exceptions, based upon the so called Fair Use defence, would be beneficial in the UK. We
concluded that importing Fair Use wholesale was unlikely to be legally feasible in Europe and
that the UK could achieve many of its benefits by taking up copyright exceptions already
permitted under EU law (…)”. The Review also pointed out on page 44 that “Most responses
to the Review from established UK businesses were implacably hostile to adoption of a US
Fair Use defence in the UK on the grounds that it would bring: massive legal uncertainty
because of its roots in American case law; an American style proliferation of high cost
litigation; and a further round of confusion for suppliers and purchasers of copyright goods.” –
we agree with these arguments as applicable to the EU.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
       NO
       The territoriality of exceptions and limitations matches the territoriality principle of
       copyright and allows for respect of Member States’ legal and cultural specificities.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
Answer : It seems reasonable that fair compensation be due in the place where the end
user benefits from the exception, as is the case, for example, with the private copying
exception (levies are due in the country in which the ‘harm’ to the rightholder arises, i.e. in
the country in which the end user who bought the product resides according to the Opus
ruling of the CJUE). In addition, it is crucial that remuneration be provided to the rightholders
in the country where they reside, which is possible thanks to reciprocal agreements between
collective management organisations.
Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject

42
        Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              25
matter in the collections of such institutions43. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive44.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.     Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

     31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
     [Open question]
     Answer : As far as film heritage institutions are concerned, the 2001 Copyright Directive
     provides for carefully crafted exceptions addressing the needs of publicly accessible libraries,
     educational establishments, museums and archives:
           -   In respect of specific acts of reproduction of works in their collections which are not
               for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage (Art 5.2(c)), not limited to
               preservation purposes as such;
           -   For communication or making available, for the purpose of research or private study,
               to individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises of their
               establishments of works not subject to purchase or licensing terms which are
               contained in their collections (Art 5.3(n)).
     These exceptions allow film archive institutions to fulfil their public interest missions.
     Above these exceptions, SAA members have offered their help to film and audiovisual
     archives institutions on many occasions to address their needs in relation to the use of the
     cinematographic and audiovisual works contained in their collections and their related
     authors’ rights. This has resulted in specific arrangements in a number of countries:
     collective agreements with INA in France, mandatory collective administration of
     broadcasters’ archives in Switzerland, extended collective agreements in the Netherlands
     and in the Nordic countries, etc.
     In addition, the SAA was a signatory of the Statement of Principles and Procedures for
     facilitating the digitisation of, access to and increased interest of European citizens in
     European cinematographic heritage works which was developed in the framework of working
     group 3 of the Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue. The Statement aims to facilitate
     discussions among the parties concerned on the relevant terms for digitisation and access to
     European cinematographic heritage works conserved in European film heritage institutions.
     The signatories “share the view that European cinematographic heritage works constitute
     unique cultural elements as well as valuable assets in the European digital economy, and
     therefore, 1) they pledge to strengthen their mutual collaboration and that with the European
     Commission and Member States relating to European cinematographic heritage works ; and
     2) at the same time, conscious of the investments necessary fully to seize the opportunities
     offered by digital technologies, they call on the Member States and the EU institutions to
     introduce financial mechanisms to support projects launched under this Statement to digitise
     European cinematographic heritage works and to promote their accessibility and increased
     discoverability by European citizens.”
     The Commission should work as a facilitator to encourage film archive institutions and their
     European representatives to explore the possibility of further agreements with audiovisual
     authors’ organisations whether at national or EU level.

5.   Off-premises access to library collections
     Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
     matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
     premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
     consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
     the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
     between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
     should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
     collections.


                                                                                                   27
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
Answer : In our view, online remote access is to be dealt with by way of licensing via
collective management organisations, as it is organised for other VOD and SVOD services.
In fact, this is already the case in several Member States to promote education for example.
As an example, the ERA educational licensing scheme in the UK enables broadcasts to be
used for educational purposes. Serving the UK education sector, ERA (Educational
Recording Agency) is one of a range of CMOs which help copyright owners and performers
derive an income from the licensed use of their works. In practice, it means that “recordings
made or sourced under the terms of an ERA Licence can be built into a resource bank for an
educational establishment covering topics such as drama, wildlife, the arts and current
affairs. Copies of licensed recordings can be made for educational use within licensed
premises. Clips from programmes can also be selected and used to encourage reference to
the resource library, or for cross reference within class presentations or lectures.
Increasingly, online relay within licensed premises linked to a white board and other in-class
presentations is widening the number of ways that licensed recordings can be used.”
In addition, educational establishments, or bodies acting on behalf of educational
establishments which hold ERA Licences, are eligible to take out “ERA Plus Licences”, an
additional licence which allows “access to the recordings by students and teachers online,
whether they are on the premises of their school, college or university, or at home or working
elsewhere within the UK”.

6.   E – lending
     Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
     also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
     technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
     such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
     need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
     various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
     business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
     to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
     36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
     when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
     across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
     (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
     when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
     borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
     (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
     to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders? X

     The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

     38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
     management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
     subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
     [Open question]
     ……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
     libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
     activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
     problems have you encountered?
            [Open question]
            Answer:

                                                                                                  29
             Because of the nature of the internet, the difference between libraries’ traditional
             activities and online consultation and e-lending is huge. The conditions for these new
             activities have to be discussed with authors’ representative organisations like CMOs
             through licencing processes which will allow libraries to develop these new activities
             and for authors to be remunerated.

7.   Mass digitisation
     The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
     libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
     an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
     Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
     whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
     EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
     digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
     found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
     efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
     and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
     authors and publishers on the other45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
     projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
     currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
     available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
     Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
     publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
     effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
     a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)46.

     40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
     digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
     necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
     (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
     border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

                You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
     http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
     46
                France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act
     (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle)
     foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The
     German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
     Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting
     society in relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                               30
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
YES
The SAA has confirmed that it is fully committed to pursue the project that was started in
WG3 (Audiovisual and Film Heritage Institutions) of Licences for Europe and find a way to
undertake mass digitization and clearance for online uses of the high volume of older works
in the archives of film heritage institutions and public services broadcasters. Audiovisual
authors’ CMOs have a central role to play in helping these institutions preserve and offer to
the public the cultural heritage of great works. We do approve such an involvement.
Thanks to the Statement of Principles and Procedures for heritage films online concluded
between ACE, FERA, FIAPF and the SAA during Licences for Europe, film heritage
institutions and rightholders’ representatives now have a clear roadmap to discuss and agree
terms for digitizing, restoring and making available European film heritage. It will enable film
heritage institutions to free up European films stored in their archives while guaranteeing
rightholders an appropriate share of the rewards.
As far as broadcasters’ archives are concerned, no broad agreement including all
stakeholders could be reached during the Licences for Europe timeframe. EBU and the SAA
together developed some recommendations highlighting that collective licensing solutions
are particularly suitable for the large scale clearance of rights. There is a clear need for
proportionate and cost effective rights clearance mechanisms for such large archives. This
would help make a very significant amount of works available, particularly for research and
educational purposes.
Further discussions are needed to develop an MoU or any other type of general agreement
that would propose a suitable solution for mass digitization and rights clearance of
broadcasters’ archives based on collective management.

F.     Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
YES

       Belgian law provides an extensive exception to the benefit of schools and education
       entities:

         Article 22.
4°quater. la communication d’œuvres lorsque cette communication est
effectuée à des fins d’illustration de l’enseignement ou de recherche
scientifique par des établissements reconnus ou organisés officiellement à
cette fin par les pouvoirs publics et pour autant que cette communication
soit justifiée par le but non lucratif poursuivi, se situe dans le cadre des
activités normales de l’établissement, soit effectuée uniquement au moyen
de réseaux de transmission fermés de l’établissement et ne porte pas
préjudice à l’exploitation normale de l’œuvre, et à moins que cela ne
s’avère impossible, la source, y compris le nom de l’auteur, soit indiquée;


It provides also that rightholders are entitled to a fair remuneration in
consideration of this exception. However the tariffs must be decided by the
Federal Government through a Royal Decree. The said Decree that has
never been taken since this exception entered into force in 1995 and
therefore no remuneration has ever been paid.

It can be therefore said in this case that the delicate balance between the
interests of the rightholders and the interests of the users has been clearly
violated.




43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Answer : The Belgian Government must take the proper measures to remunerate rightholders
for such use. This shows how difficult it can be to set a proper and needed remuneration when
public authorities are on both sides of the table as user and as regulator. A EU legislation must
favour an organised negociation between rightholders and public users on the tariffs. Indeed,
it does not belong to the Rightholders to finance a public missions.

G.     Research
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

H.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?

I.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”53. In the context of these discussions,

52
           For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

J.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions55.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?


54
           A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing
sound recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups”
(blending two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .

                                                                                                             37
YES -
As a preliminary remark, it has to be noticed that there is no universally-acknowledged
definition of what constitutes user-generated content (UGC). Furthermore, there is different
types of UGC schemes and contractual framework.The questionnaire refers to UGC as a
new type of online activity, taking one or several pre-existing works, changing something in
the works and uploading the result onto the internet e.g. to platforms and blogs.
The De Wolf and CRIDS study on the application of the 2001/29/EC Directive acknowledges
that a major part of UGC which may be found on the internet requires in principle a prior
licence from the rightholders whose works are used.
Whether amateur or professional, creative works are subject to the same copyright rules.
Meaning that the use of existing protected works needs to be authorised by the rightholder,
unless an exception can be invoked.
The Commission document for this consultation highlights that social media platforms have
vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for
rightholders in the pre-existing works. If this is the case, why is there so little case-law on this
issue as discovered by De Wolf and CRIDS in their study?
Authors do not oppose UGC in principle. They are very familiar with creative processes
which use pre-existing works, in particular in the audiovisual sector where films very often
use recorded music and documentaries are sometimes made of extracts of older works. The
process is therefore not new, particularly for professional authors, and authorisation
guarantees respect for moral rights.
What is striking with UGC is the claim of some users to create UGC content without seeking
the permission of the authors of the pre-existing works, but to ask for recognition of their
rights on the new works. This is unacceptable, as is the way in which Q.59 below is phrased
– it recognises the rights of the creator of the new work but fails to acknowledge the rights of
the original rightholder, i.e. the owner of the pre-existing work(s) on the basis of which the
new work was created!
The essence of this activity renders any court proceedings ineffective: rightholders would
probably win the case from a legal perspective but the costs of the proceedings largely
outweigh the possible financial benefit.
It is a pity that WG2 of Licences for Europe was unable to deliver on this issue, due to the
opposition of users’ groups to any licensing solutions as they favor the introduction of a new
exception to authors’ rights.
In our view, the solution to user-generated content lies in licensing schemes concluded
between rightholders’ representatives such as audiovisual authors’ CMOs and the social
media platforms as well as micro-licences for small users, unless an exception is applicable.
In fact, many examples of licensing schemes are already being developed (e.g. in the music
sector according to GESAC’s statement and IFPI’s announcement) and should be
encouraged and promoted.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
       [Open question]
       ANSWER: As previously said in our answer to Q.58, the use of pre-existing protected
       works to create user-generated content needs the authorisation of the authors or their
       representatives (in particular, to guarantee respect for moral rights), unless an
       exception can be invoked.
       The De Wolf and CRIDS study on the application of the 2001/29/EC Directive pointed
       out that “a UGC exception remains a premature option” and there does not seem to
       be a need to act for the moment. We support this view and consider that there is no
       need for a new exception being introduced for UGC. However, the study notes that a
       Commission Communication on UGC to clarify what uses are allowed and give an
       opinion on what exceptions are relevant may be useful. We are ready to consider
       such a communication.
       Anything falling outside existing exceptions should be dealt with via simple licensing
       solutions. These licensing mechanisms should be devised to ensure that very
       personal uses would cost virtually nothing in terms of licensing fees and the cost of
       licenses generally would be proportionate to the use made of the works. It is
       noteworthy that internet platforms should not be the main beneficiaries of the success


                                                                                          39
         of UGC, so licenses with the platforms rather than only with the individuals
         themselves should also be sought.

elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

63.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


         ANSWER : As previously mentioned in our answer to Q.61, anything falling outside
         the existing exceptions should be dealt with via simple licensing solutions. It must
         also be stressed that freedom of expression must be balanced with the respect of the
         intellectual property as stated by the ECHR in the case ASHBY DONALD v. France
         (January 10 2013)




     IV. Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

         These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the
mediation on private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions59 in the digital environment?
YES -
Focusing on the private copying exception, SAA’s contributions to the Vitorino report and to
the European Parliament report drafted by Mrs. Castex MEP on private copying levies (here)
aimed at highlighting and ensuring that the following principles are recognised and enforced
at EU level:
         Private copying and reprography are justly accompanied by compensation for the
          rightholders.
         Having levies on devices and media making private copies is an efficient and cost-
          effective way to organise the compensation.
         An important element of the system’s cost-effectiveness is to collect the levies at the
          earliest stages of the sales chain, i.e. from the manufacturer or the importer.
         The amount of private copying compensation should be linked to the value of the
          creative works being copied, not to the price of the devices which can depend on
          commercial strategies.
         The private copying system should be brought into the digital age taking into account
          that consumers make private copies more than ever before on ever more connected
          devices and services.
         There is a need for common principles for defining applicable levy rates and
          devices/services that should be subject to levies.
The SAA produced a comprehensive infographic (in English, French and German) explaining
why the system of private copying levies is so important for rightholders and should be
upheld, whilst also proposing ways in which the system could be improved.
It is of particular concern for the SAA that the UK government proposed a private copying
exception without any accompanying fair compensation mechanism – in clear breach of Art 5
of the Copyright Directive. This situation combined with the Spanish one, where the
government eliminated levies and transferred to the state budget the fair compensation
obligation but with only a very reduced amount, reinforces the need for harmonisation of the
private copying exception and its fair compensation.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?60
YES -


59
         Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
60
         This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
mediation on private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          41
In its contributions to the European Parliament ‘Castex report’, the SAA explained that Mr.
Vitorino’s recommendation (licensed copies do not cause harm) suggests that all subsequent
copies made of a work following purchase from digital services can be covered by licenses
granted by rightholders to these services. Mr Vitorino therefore proposed to eliminate levies
for “new business models in the digital environment”.
This is based on a gross misconception of both the private copying system and the multitude
of new digital services which provide access to protected works. Private copies cannot be
licensed since they are covered by a statutory exception to copyright under the 2001/29
Copyright Directive. Therefore licensing and fair compensation for private copying can only
be separate issues.
Moreover, if the private copying exception was questioned and private copies inserted into
licences, the ones that would suffer most from such a change would be consumers and
authors, the consumers losing their freedom to copy and the authors their fair compensation.
      In practice, the authorisation, licence fee and commercial terms are negotiated by the
       holders of exclusive rights with each digital service during the licensing process,
       whereas fair compensation is collected through the levy system and distributed to
       rightholders by CMOs.
      Mr. Vitorino’s proposal derives from the flawed idea that digital services would allow
       rightholders to be compensated directly. In practice, only few rightholders or
       categories of rightholders grant licences to digital services (the producers or further
       intermediaries). Other rightholders, such as audiovisual authors who transferred their
       exclusive rights to the producer sometimes for a lump-sum payment, do not have any
       direct relation with digital services and therefore, no possibility to be paid directly.
      In this field, a huge advantage of the private copying system is that it corrects
       inequalities between rightholders and guarantees that each category of rightholders
       benefits from a fair share of the value.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

       Answer: We believe that the application of levies to certain online services is justified
       and does not think that it would hinder the development and functioning of new
       business models. One of the reasons being that, just like the prices of products
       across Europe do not vary in proportion to the levy rates, the prices of online
       services/new business models are most probably also unaffected by the levy rates.
       More copying for private use takes place now than ever before. The devices and
       media which enable or host private copies of protected works have increased, with
       storage capacities which have grown exponentially (iPad of 128 Go, external hard
       disks of 5To, etc.).
       Consumers transfer songs and videos from computers to hard drives to phones to
       tablets to online lockers and back again in order to save and access their personal
       libraries whenever and wherever they want. All of these processes are undeniably
       acts of private copying.



                                                                                             42
        In addition, in line with the principle of technical neutrality, copies made via cloud
        services (and other future digital services which do not yet exist) many have the same
        purpose (private use) as the copies made by private individuals on their phones,
        tablets, etc. so should be included in the private copying system.
        Applying private copying to certain cloud-based services means that copies made on
        those specific cloud-based services would be taken into account by usage studies
        which assess the harm caused.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?61
        YES
        Past and recent consultation processes on private copying levies have shown that
        stakeholders agree that levies should be clearly visible on all bills and contracts in the
        products’ sales chain (this is for example already the case in Belgium thanks to a new
        Belgian law applicable since 1 December 2013) and in sale shops and professionals’
        invoices in France from 1st April 2014(Decree of 10 December 2013).
        In addition, consumers should be informed of the amount and destination of the levies
        and more generally the reason for this mechanism which compensates the freedom
        to copy they have thanks to the private copying exception. This would help
        consumers understand how important the levy system is for the EU’s culture and
        rightholders and that they are part of and benefit from this virtuous system.


68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
        NO
        If the system of private copying levies is harmonised as we have proposed, there
        would be no issue of undue levy payments. The rule would be that the levy is due in
        the Member State in which the final user who purchased the product resides since
        that is where the ‘harm’ to the rightholder would arise (CJEU Opus ruling). In any
        case, even if undue levy payments occasionally did occur, exemptions and
        reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that such equipment does not
        bear levies.




61
         This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
mediation on private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          43
69 What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.). Answer :
As stated in the contribution of SAA to the European Parliament report on private copying
levies, devices and blank media can serve other purposes than for the private copying of
protected works. This should be taken into account when determining tariffs applicable to
devices used to make private copies.
In addition, there are cases where certain devices and media will clearly not be used for the
purpose of private copying. We talk of ‘professional uses’. In this context, exemptions and
reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that the equipment concerned does not
bear levies. However, exempting any business from private copying levies would be
excessive since equipment bought by companies can also generate private copies. The
determining factor is the nature of the use, not the quality of the purchaser.
      As recommended by the CJEU in the “Padawan” ruling (C-467/08), professional uses
       should be excluded from payment of the levy, but not necessarily all purchases of
       professional users. Devices such as tablets or smartphones, despite being the
       property of a company, may well in fact be used by employees to copy protected
       works for private use. Recommending that private copying levies should apply
       exclusively to purchases by natural persons as private users would artificially reduce
       the scope of the private copying system.
      Exemption and refund systems for professional uses should be designed at national
       level in consideration of the specificities of the Member States concerned.
      The “Austro-Mechana” CJEU ruling (C-521/11) confirmed that reimbursement
       schemes for the levies paid on devices that are not ultimately used for private
       purposes comply with EU law, as long as they are effectively applied and do not
       constitute an excessive burden for those who are entitled to reimbursement.


70 Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
   extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in
   some Member States help to remedy the situation?
[[Open question]

ANSWER : Please see our response to Q.68 above.


71 If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system,
how would these problems best be solved?

       Answer :
       Firstly, as stated in all of SAA’s contributions on this topic, the rightholders’ proposal
       to introduce a single declaration point would facilitate declaration and payment
       procedures by manufacturers/importers. Indeed, the proposal to create a single
       European declaration was put forward by European rightholders during the 2008-
       2009 dialogue, and agreed with the ICT industry. It aims to facilitate the
       implementation of the “Opus” ruling of the CJEU (C-462/09). Via the “European
       Central Point” mechanism, distance sellers could submit declarations of sales of
       goods eligible to private copying levies at a single EU entry point, while the
       compensation would be invoiced and paid in the country of destination.


                                                                                              44
        Secondly, the most efficient and cost-effective way to collect levies is to do so at the
        earliest stage of the sales chain, i.e. the manufacture or import stage. Shifting the
        liability to pay levies onto retailers, as proposed by Mr. Vitorino, would render the
        system extremely complex and costly since this would considerably increase the
        number of those responsible for paying the levies (from 500 currently in France, with
        a small number responsible for the bulk of the sales, to approximately 20,000
        according to Copie France) and the means needed to ensure billing and control
        systems (Copie France believes that it would have to deal with 40 times more
        information).
        The prime responsibility of manufacturers and importers for payment of the levies
        must go hand in hand with joint liability of all entities throughout the chain of sales
        down to the final consumer in order to avoid potential fraud and unfair competition.
        This principle was also agreed between representatives of rightholders and the ICT
        industry during the 2008-2009 dialogue.
        Thirdly, the fact that leviable devices and blank media differ across Member States
        means that the same product can be subject to private copying levies in a Member
        State and not in another. Compensation systems should be in place for all devices
        and media whose value is increased by multimedia storage and playback features.
        Therefore, a consistent definition of devices and media subject to private copying
        levies in the respective Member States should be sought.The SAA and other
        rightholders’ organisations proposed during the 2008-2009 dialogue that all products
        (devices and media) able to be used to make private copies of protected works
        should be eligible for the private copying compensation scheme, with a list of
        products established and regularly updated at EU level.
        However, the interruption of the dialogue by the ICT industry in 2010 did not end in
        any concrete result and the Vitorino report was a missed opportunity as, despite
        suggesting a degree of harmonisation (such as regarding the definition of harm), Mr.
        Vitorino recommended Member State flexibility in the choice of devices subject to
        levies.
        Fourthly, European rightholders organisations agree that a quick and harmonised
        levy setting procedure should be developed across Europe. This would mean putting
        in place a European framework of definitions, principles and procedures to be
        respected by all Member States in the establishment of their levy setting process.

     V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,

62
        See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
        See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                             45
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

             72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism
             (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate
             remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?


   Answer :
Fair remuneration of authors is a very important issue related in particular to the online
distribution of audiovisual works, as explained in SAA’s White Paper on Audiovisual Authors’
Rights and Remuneration published in February 2011.

It is as well a very important issue for other categories of Authors, for instance, of graphical et
litteray works.

For audiovisual authors, such a ‘best mechanism’ to ensure that they receive adequate
remuneration for the exploitation of their works does not yet exist. ‘Adequate remuneration’
should relate to the use made of the authors’ works and should in particular reward the
success of works. This is why buy-out contracts, which prevent this from happening, would
never amount to mechanisms guaranteeing adequate remuneration.
Contractual practices in the vast majority of European countries deprive audiovisual authors
of their rights and prevent them from receiving fair remuneration, in particular for the online
distribution of their works (please see our answer to Q.73 on unfair contracts below).
Audiovisual authors in most countries are forced, because of their weak bargaining position
and the absence of legislation to protect them, to assign all their rights and receive a one-off
fee at the production stage with no further payments linked to the exploitation of the work,
except for collectively managed rights such as cable retransmission and private copying.
These further payments linked to the exploitation of the work (which can continue for years)
are however essential for authors to make a living in-between projects. The characteristic of
this profession is that it can take years to prepare a film and enter into production.
We do support the proposal of SAA to by-pass these unfair contractual practices and to
develop a sustainable remuneration system which would secure audiovisual authors’
remuneration for their making available right in the digital market, taking advantage of the
new technologies.
Such a proposal for European legislation builds on the harmonisation experience in the EU:
   -   the 1992 Rental Right Directive which provides for an unwaivable remuneration right
       for the rental.
   -   the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive which provides for mandatory collective
       administration of the cable retransmission right
SAA’s proposal takes the best from both of these: it provides that when an audiovisual author
has transferred his making available right to a producer, he retains the right to obtain
equitable remuneration for the making available which cannot be waived, as is the case for
the rental right. It also addresses the implementation aspects in order to ensure that the
proposal will result in concrete payments to authors.
Two implementation aspects are extremely important and were lacking in the 1992 Rental
Right Directive: who should pay for the equitable remuneration and how should it be


                                                                                                46
administered. Having learned from this experience, SAA’s proposal addresses these two
aspects:
   -   The equitable remuneration should be paid by audiovisual media services that make
       audiovisual works available to the public on-demand;
   -   Its administration should be entrusted to collective management organisations
       representing audiovisual authors, unless other audiovisual authors’ organisations,
       such as unions or guilds, are in a better position to guarantee such remuneration in a
       specific country.
This European legislation is a necessity as contractual practices are unable to guarantee
such remuneration to audiovisual authors for the making available of their works. European
producers, which are mainly small companies, are very much focused on the production
stage and little involved in the subsequent exploitation. They have therefore not developed
industrial processes and mechanisms to trace and administer payments due to authors for
the distribution of their works on multiple platforms and most of them would prefer not to do it
at all since it would be costly. The only entities to do this are authors’ collective management
organisations. They are today ready to invest further in order to address the remuneration
due to audiovisual authors for the online distribution of their works.
It does however have to be clarified that SAA’s proposal does not interfere with the
producer’s role. It aims at organising the remuneration due to authors, once the producer has
decided to make the work available to the public in such a manner and at the time he
chooses. It therefore means that any on-demand exploitation of an audiovisual work will
continue to have to be cleared with the producer or with the making available right holder
appointed by the producer or subsequent contractor.


73 Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
YES
We support an intervention by the Commission into contractual practices. Indeed, we
support fairer contractual terms and practices, whilst acknowledging that this will not solve all
the problems, in particular the remuneration issue of audiovisual authors for the exploitation
of their works. Any initiative in this field should therefore complement the introduction into EU
legislation of an unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making
available right, based on the revenues generated from the online distribution of their works
and collected by collective management organisations from final distributors (as explained in
our answer to Q.72 above).
This call for action of audiovisual authors and their representative organisations like the SAA
is clearly supported by the European Parliament who stated its view twice in recent years:
   -   In the excellent report on the challenges facing the distribution of European cinema in
       the digital era prepared by Mr Borys, a Polish MEP (resolution), the European
       Parliament stated in November 2011: “Underlines the need to accompany the
       development of new online exploitation methods with the implementation, at
       European level, of fair remuneration for audiovisual authors that is proportional to the
       revenues generated by these new formats and services”.
   -   In a report on the online distribution of audiovisual works in the EU prepared by Mr
       Cavada, a French MEP (resolution), the European Parliament stated again in
       September 2012:
           o   “Maintains that it is essential to guarantee authors and performers
               remuneration that is fair and proportional to all forms of exploitation of their
               works, especially online exploitation, and therefore calls upon the Member
               States to ban buy-out contracts, which contradict this principle;”

                                                                                              47
           o “Calls for the bargaining position of authors and performers vis-à-vis
              producers to be rebalanced by providing authors and performers with an
              unwaivable right to remuneration for all forms of exploitation of their works,
              including ongoing remuneration where they have transferred their exclusive
              ‘making available’ right to a producer;”
74 If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
Answer :
In most European countries, audiovisual authors suffer from unfair contractual terms
(excessive transfer of rights in terms of scope and duration, transfer of rights to
remuneration, etc.) imposed by producers or broadcasters in the individual negotiation of
their contract. These negotiations too often result in buy-out contracts, authors receiving a
lump sum payment for the writing and/or directing of the film, with no further payment no
matter how commercially successful the film goes on to be. Even when authors sign
contracts which respect their economic interests and provide for additional remuneration,
they rarely receive any payment automatically, except when collective rules are in place and
enforced in particular by collective rights management organisations.
In parallel to European initiatives to ensure proper remuneration of authors, consideration
should be given to developing key standards for fair and enforceable contractual terms in
individual contracts, including the prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.
Here are a number of concrete examples of unfair contract terms and practices from the UK:
      Especially in film contracts, deferral of fees. Fees are usually deferred to a point
       where a film earns back sufficient revenue or profits. It is quite common that films fail
       to earn back enough to trigger the reimbursement of the deferral so these clauses are
       effectively agreements to waive pay. A UK member of SAA, Directors UK, notes that
       research carried out shows the extent of this practice in the UK. The key conclusions
       were that:
                   i. 70% of directors experience some form of fee deferral
                  ii. 20% experienced fee reductions after the closure of the original deal
                  iii. 13.3% experienced changes in potential bonuses after closure
                  iv. Of those experiencing deferral, 50% deferred 50% or more of fees,
                      with 40% deferring 80-100% of fees
      Where contracts do contain an entitlement to bonuses or rewards for success, these
       are most often expressed as percentages of net profits or of producer profits. In
       practice, because of the fact that producers themselves can be in a poor position,
       dubious accounting practices and breaks in the distribution chain (see below) it is
       very rare that any returns from such clauses ever materialise.
      It is common for film rights (and sometimes TV rights) to be traded and re-traded from
       one intermediary/aggregator/distributor to another, either on a territory or media
       basis. Contracts may still hold the original producer liable to pay further rewards to a
       director, but this can be frustrated if there is a break in the chain of intermediaries for
       whatever reason (e.g. bankruptcy, failure to report a transfer of rights) and if the
       original production company itself goes into liquidation – this is common when a
       special purpose vehicle company is set up to make a film and then dissolved once it
       is completed.
In addition, one way of ensuring the enforceability of fair contractual terms would be that
producers applying for public funds for the production of films and audiovisual works should
be obliged to provide a copy of authors’ contracts among the documentation. The body
providing for the financial support would have the obligation to check it. This would be a
                                                                                               48
strong incentive for producers to better respect authors’ rights as it would become a pre-
condition for obtaining public financial support.
In the SAA White Paper on Audiovisual Authors’ Rights and Remuneration in Europe, SAA
carried out a survey of the situation of audiovisual authors in the different EU countries and
realised the important differences in legal traditions, audiovisual market sizes, etc. We did
not judge the harmonisation of contractual practices to be an adequate option to ensure
equal remuneration conditions to authors throughout Europe. We therefore developed a
specific proposal to achieve this objective: the unwaivable right to remuneration of
audiovisual authors for their making available right with compulsory collective management.
This would ensure that, whatever the contract signed with the producer, online services
would have to negotiate with authors’ organisations and would guarantee remuneration for
each exploitation of a work, without relying on the long contractual chain that today deprives
most authors of their remuneration for the exploitation of their works.
Other categories of Authors suffer the same contractual burdens and diminished bargaining
powers, such as literary and graphical authors.


     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

         75 Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
            infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
         NO - Please explain
         The scope of the question and clarifications of the civil enforcement system in the EU
         should not be limited to infringements committed ‘with a commercial purpose’. All
         infringements should be punished. The only difference being that sanctions will be
         larger for commercial purpose infringements.
         As stated in the SAA’s contribution to the Commission’s public consultation on the
         Enforcement Directive in March 2011, clarifications of the 2004/48/EC IPRs
         Enforcement Directive are necessary to avoid ambiguities and adapt the Directive to
64
           Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights.
65
           You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
           For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that
depend on the volume of traffic.
67
           This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                                 49
   the challenges posed in particular by today’s digital environment. There are indeed a
   number of useful improvements and gaps in protection which should be considered.
   In this context, we do not support any form of legislation that would decriminalise so-
   called non-commercial infringements. Given the nature of enforcement online, such
   decriminalisation would provide a readymade defence for structurally-infringing
   websites.
    76 In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
       sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
       advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
       inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not,
       what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?



       Answer:
Although Art 8(3) of the Copyright Directive is an effective tool in achieving cooperation
from intermediaries against copyright infringement, some Member States still have not
correctly implemented this provision and the corresponding provisions of the
Enforcement Directive. As a result, their Courts still require a finding of some form of
liability on the part of the intermediary: they hold that injunctions against intermediaries
can only be granted if the intermediary can be imputed with liability (n Germany,
Sweden). This is not what Art 8(3) states: injunctions are on the basis that the
intermediary is best placed to bring an infringement to an end (confirmed by the CJEU).
There is therefore a need for correct implementation of Art 8(3) by all Member States to
foster cooperation of intermediaries.
MdA welcomes recent national court decisions, for example in France, which are
clarifying the role of intermediaries in the IP enforcement infrastructure. They are
increasingly required to carry out an active role and take on responsibilities.
   Indeed, a recent decision of the Paris High Court (‘Tribunal de Grande Instance’)
   ordered the defendants, internet service providers (Orange, Bouygues Telecom,
   Numéricable, Free, SFR and Darty Télécom) and search engines (Google, Microsoft,
   Yahoo! and Orange), to take all measures to block access to streaming sites
   Allostreaming, and other sites belonging to the same network, for a year. The court
   found that the claimant (cinema professionals) had demonstrated that the sites were
   entirely or almost entirely dedicated to reproducing audiovisual works without the
   rightholders’ authorisation. This judgement is an important step in the fight against
   online piracy which will force rightholders and intermediaries to cooperate (as the
   costs of such blocking measures will be borne by the rightholders). It is also the first
   time that search engines have been ordered to delist pirate sites. Such court
   decisions, as well as national legislative initiatives on ‘notice and takedown’ (e.g.
   HADOPI 3-strikes, Italy’s new Regulation on online copyright infringements) seem to
   be proof that the notification procedure is evolving in the right direction:
   intermediaries’ actual knowledge of the illegal content no longer seems to be a
   precondition to engage their liability. Mda strongly encourages the Commission to
   examine the possibility of integrating a ‘notice and takedown’ type mechanism in the
   future revised Enforcement Directive. In addition, the notification procedure (and the
   information to be provided) as well as the impact of this procedure, i.e. the action to
   be taken by the hosting provider (immediate take down (as quickly as possible within
   24 hours) and stay down of illegal content, not just the links to it) should be
   harmonised.



                                                                                         50
        In addition, cooperation between rightholders and intermediaries could also lead to
        the development of useful filtering technologies which could be developed by
        platforms and implemented at the stage when users upload content onto their
        servers. This filtering technology would be based on databases of works which have
        been registered, with a view to identifying and blocking illegal content. In this context,
        cooperation between rights holders and providers is key to developing such
        databases of protected content and should therefore be encouraged.



77 Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?
     YES – Please explain
        According to the Court of Justice of the European Union68 a fair balance must be
        struck between the various rights at stake (such as the right to data protection and
        the right to property, which includes IPR) given that both are recognised as
        fundamental rights by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
        National courts have then to apply a proportionality test and weigh all fundamental
        rights in order to arrive to a balanced result. It therefore looks like there are sufficient
        safeguards in place to ensure fair outcomes.

            VII.          A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

      78 Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
         a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
         copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
NO



79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
        Answer:
        As SSAA we do not see the need for “an optional unitary EU Copyright Title”. This
        proposal to use Article 118 TFEU69 in the field of copyright was first made by the

68
       Judgment of 29 January 2008 in the case C-275/06 Productores de Música de España
(Promusicae) v. Telefónica de España SAU.
69
         “In the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market, the European Parliament
and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall establish measures for the

                                                                                                            51
        Commission in 2009 and then repeated in several documents but the Commission
        never explained the need for and the use of such a title. The only information
        delivered in the Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works was that
        “authors or producers of audiovisual works would have the option to register their
        works and then obtain a single title that would be valid throughout the EU”. This
        (overly) brief presentation raises two questions: the registration condition and the
        nature of the title.
        In terms of copyright protection, the Berne Convention prohibits any formality such as
        registration as a condition for the enjoyment and exercise of rights. Authors are very
        much attached to this prohibition which guarantees their rights in all circumstances as
        far as their creation is original and therefore deserves protection. Consequently,
        authors are very reluctant to see any system based on registration as it endangers
        their authorship of works and their freedom of expression.
        From a practical point of view, to pursue such a proposal, the Commission should
        then either undertake to revise the Berne convention or to define the nature of the title
        out of the copyright sphere.
        Because of the formality prohibition, such titles do not exist in the copyright sphere.
        The only existing registries in the audiovisual sector have limited scope and impact
        which do not affect rights’ protection and exercise (for example the necessary work
        declaration to an authors’ society for an author to receive related payments, or the
        French cinema public registry which offers the statutory publication of certain
        contracts).
        Article 118 TFUE has obviously been introduced for industrial property purposes and
        refers to the setting-up of centralised EU-wide authorisation, coordination and
        supervision arrangements, which do not seem relevant to authors’ rights.

VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

    80 Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
       copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
Answer:
More generally, it is crucial that creators be placed at the centre of EU copyright policy. After
years of distrust and attacks against copyright by users’ and consumers’ groups who want to
undermine a system that they do not consider fit for the digital age, there is an essential need
to give back legitimacy to a system that promotes creativity, freedom of expression and
dissemination of culture.
The best way to provide legitimacy to the copyright system is to reconnect it to creators and
ensure that creators are the first and main beneficiaries of the licence fees and remuneration
paid by users.

creation of European intellectual property rights to provide uniform protection of intellectual property rights
throughout the Union and for the setting up of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision
arrangements.

         The Council, acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure, shall by means of regulations
establish language arrangements for the European intellectual property rights. The Council shall act unanimously
after consulting the European Parliament.”

                                                                                                              52
The current European copyright law does not provide for such a guarantee, except in limited
cases (unwaivable right to equitable remuneration for the rental right) and gives rise to
criticisms that it only works to the benefit of major entertainment companies.
There is therefore a need to rebalance European copyright policy in favour of authors and
other creators as original rightholders. This needs to be the focus and priority of any
forthcoming copyright reform.
This is a win-win solution for users and for all rightholders as it would clarify that creators are
the main beneficiaries of the copyright system and therefore strengthen its legitimacy and its
enforcement, in particular online.
In the audiovisual sector, to ensure such rebalancing, SAA has proposed in its White Paper
on the Audiovisual Authors’ Rights and Remuneration in Europe the introduction in the
European legislation of an unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their
making available right, based on the revenues generated from the online distribution of their
works and collected by collective management organisations from final distributors.
The digital age has presented CMOs with a set of major challenges to many aspects of their
operations. The analogue world has been replaced by one characterised by mass uses and
transactions of copyright works, lower values of licences for transactions and much greater
flexibility in the type of uses being made and the devices on which uses take place. CMOs
have adapted to this – and continue to do so – by doing the following:
      Investing in new technology, software and systems to keep their licensing operations
       fit for purpose
      Improving their governance, transparency and accountability to members and users
      Simplifying their licensing procedures to reduce transaction costs
      Innovating in the kind of licences being offered
      Making it a central objective to see the works of members receive the greatest
       possible legitimate distribution
      Promoting the use of copyright works for education and cultural purposes
      Making it a priority to engage young people directly whether they are users or
       creators of copyright works – and sometimes both at the same time – so that they
       learn respect for the value of creativity and are encouraged to express themselves
       creatively
We feel that the tone of the debate over copyright has so far been far too confrontational.
Our desire is to see a much healthier relationship develop between creators and the
audiences for their works. Accordingly, we approved of the collaborative approach adopted
by the Commission during the Licences for Europe stakeholders’ dialogue and we were
disappointed that many groups failed to step forward in that spirit. We would urge them to
come back to this notion of collaboration.
Finally, it is important to note, as proven by the confused and contradictory national rulings,
the differing implementation of the provisions of the 93/83/EEC Satellite and Cable Directive
(“SatCab Directive”) by the Member States and the cable section of the De Wolf study on the
application of the Copyright Directive, that clarifications of different aspects of the cable
retransmission right are needed in order to provide legal certainty to all stakeholders
involved. The ongoing litigation in several Member States shows that the existing grey areas
are being exploited by commercial operators (especially leading cable operators) to try and
escape their obligations under the SatCab Directive.
It is worth reiterating that the objective of the SatCab Directive was to lighten the burden of
cable operators when it is not possible for them, for practical reasons, to acquire the rights in
time of all people concerned by the retransmission, so in case of retransmissions, they

                                                                                                53
simply conclude contracts with collective management organisations (“CMOs”), not with all
rightholders.
Firstly, clarification is needed regarding the initial transmission where uncertainty relates to
the “direct injection”70 of TV and radio programmes in the cable network. It needs to be that
both act of communication requires a distinct remuneration, the first act from the
broadcasters and second act, the retransmission from the cable operator through mandatory
collective management agreement.
Secondly, the question of responsibility of the different stakeholders involved, especially
broadcasters, cable and alternative operators, also needs to be clarified to ensure
rightholders a high level of protection. Indeed, the consequence of qualifying the direct
injection and the subsequent cable retransmission as one act of communication to the public
by cable is that mandatory collective management does not apply (only applies in cases of
cable re-transmissions) so right holders’ consent and remuneration is required only once. As
stated in the De Wolf study on the application of the Copyright Directive (pp.227-228), the
author E. Traple correctly explains that “this complex act of cable transmission is monetised
at different stages, by the broadcaster and the cable operator. The fact that a public is
reached makes it possible for the broadcaster to close advertisement deals, while the cable
operator receives the cable subscription fees. The rightholders may consent to the cable
transmission of the programme with one party only and calculate the fees without a precise
idea of the total financial return for all economic operators involved.” Accordingly, E. Traple
concluded against a restrictive interpretation of the term “retransmission” which “leads to a
significant limitation of the level of protection of rightholders” contrary to the objective of the
Directive which he recalled is “to create legal certainty for the cable operators as to the
acquisition of rights and to ensure a high level of protection for the authors and rightholders”.
Consequently, the more the system of mandatory collective management applies, the better
protected rightholders will be.
Thirdly, another necessary clarification is to decide whether the SatCab Directive is
technology-specific or technology-neutral. The De Wolf study noted (pp.228-233) that an
upcoming “economic study should assess whether there is a need for an extension of the
mandatory collective management regime to categories of retransmission other than the
retransmission by coaxial cable”. However, it is worth noting that most Member States,
except the UK and Austria (as per to the study) have so far interpreted the SatCab Directive
in a technology-specific way, meaning that new media operators are generally prevented
from being able to simply turn to CMOs to negotiate contracts for the retransmission of the
broadcast content. Time has passed since the 2002 Commission report when it was thought
too early to consider such an extension, and the time when the possibility of retransmitting
works via the internet and other networks was not well known has long gone. In addition, the
simultaneous character of these new types of transmissions makes it practically impossible
to clear the rights in time. Moreover, regarding the new media platforms, a 2007 study by
EBU71 explained that “with a view to safeguarding a level-playing field, the system of
simplified clearance of cable distribution rights should be extended to comparable cases of
retransmission of broadcasts by commercial third-party operators over wired, mobile and
other wireless “new media” platforms, such as broadband, mobile telephony and digital
terrestrial or satellite (“bouquets”) platforms, provided that such retransmission takes place
simultaneously, completely and without modification and, in particular, provided that the

70
          Defined as “the distribution by cable of programmes, which are transmitted by the broadcaster to the
cable operator by means of a dedicated line, in order to to be then transmitted to the public by means of a cable”
by the Brussels Court of Appeal in 1998 in a case brought by Uradex (CMO for performers). In this case, the court
considered that both the direct injection and the cable distribution following a direct injection were retransmission
by cables, but the Court of First Instance deviated from this position.

individual subscribers to the retransmission service are clearly identifiable and that they are
charged by the third-party operator for access to the respective programme service.”
Therefore, we call on the Commission to take action to recognise, that in the digital age, new
media operators which carry out retransmissions should be subject to the same rules as
cable operators and that leading cable operators should not be able to escape responsibility
