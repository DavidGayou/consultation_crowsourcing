                 Creativity Works! Position on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules


Creativity Works! is a coalition of like-minded organisations from the European cultural and creative sectors.
We represent a wide range of stakeholders, from film directors, video games developers, broadcasters,
writers, screenwriters and book publishers to sports organisations, cinema exhibitors, picture agencies,
music and film/TV producers, publishers and distributors.

The European Commission launched a Public Consultation on the review of the EU Copyright Rules in early
December 2013. The Commission’s main objective as it considers a copyright review should be to ensure
that in the digital age, Europe maintains the right regulatory conditions to enable our sectors to keep
creating and investing in creative content and innovative new delivery formats for consumers to enjoy.

The Commission must maintain an evidence-based approach to its review of the copyright rules, ensuring
that the debate is balanced and constructive and the necessary time is given to consider and thoroughly
review all information and evidence available. In particular, it must take into account the ongoing market
developments and efforts of the creative sectors to meet consumer needs.

Europe must be a place where creators, creative industries and citizens can continue to thrive. Dynamic
and flourishing creative sectors are crucial for any digital economy to prosper. The EU Copyright Directive as
well as the Acquis has demonstrated its flexibility by enabling our sectors to continuously invent, invest in
and create new cultural works for citizens to enjoy in the digital age.

This document includes some core principles which we believe should underpin the review of the EU
copyright rules, as well as an overview of our positions on key themes in the Commission’s current
consultation.

                                       Creativity Works! Core Principles

 Europe’s cultural diversity and creative edge are strategic assets underpinning the EU’s global soft power,
  and should be strengthened.

 Europe’s creative sectors are an integral part of our cultural and economic fabric, especially as images,
  words, sounds and ideas have increasingly become the drivers of innovation and growth, jobs and
  prosperity. IP-intensive industries contribute 26% of EU employment and 39% of GDP; within this, the core
  Copyright-intensive industries generate 7 million jobs, contribute approximately €509 billion to the
  economy and produce a healthy trade surplus.1

 Copyright is the most effective enabler for the creation, financing, production and dissemination of
  cultural works. It is the economic foundation for Europe’s cultural and creative industries and drives massive
  investment in diverse and professional content, continued growth and innovation in Europe. Major
  commercial broadcasters in Europe for example spend over €15 billion annually on content – an impressive
  €41 million every day.2 European book publishers released 535,000 new titles in 2012.3

 The creative sectors are champions of emerging technologies, driving change and innovative solutions so
  professional and private users can access and interact with ever more creative content online. The app
  explosion for example is largely games-based, with 72% of all App Store revenue now coming from that
  sector.4

 Copyright Works! The market is delivering and online offers are booming – never before have European
  citizens had access to so many works and services. Today we can enjoy over 2 million e-book titles, over 30
  million licensed songs, and over 3000 Video-on-Demand (VOD) services.5 There are now 260 licensed digital
  music services in the EU and total spending on online video transactions soared to €673.7 million in 2012,
  97.1% up from 2011.6

 The need to adapt the EU’s Copyright rules must be evidenced. The burden of proof must be on those
  demanding change to show its potential benefits for Europe’s economy and citizens. Empirical evidence
  shows the content market in Europe is healthily competitive and growing at a faster rate than the wider
  economy.7 In the UK for example, employment in the creative industries increased by 8.6% between 2011
  and 2012, a higher rate than for the UK economy as a whole (0.7%).8 In France, culture represents an
  impressive 3.2% of GDP. In Germany, copyright-intensive industries contribute 4% of GDP and represent
  some 1.4 million jobs. In Poland, 4.1% of GDP.9 The undisputable economic weight of our sectors should be
  the basis for assessing the potential benefits for Europe of reviewing the EU Copyright rules.

 The current Copyright Framework in Europe is flexible and constantly evolving, be it through legislative
  measures such as the 2012 Orphan Works Directive and the 2014 Collective Rights Management Directive 10,
  or through the market, where businesses of all sizes are developing creative and cultural works and services
  for European consumers.

 In a fast-changing global environment, Europe’s creative sectors rely on legal certainty to underpin their
  ongoing investments in developing new professional works and innovative and consumer-friendly offers.
  Record companies invested €3.5bn in discovering and nurturing new artists (A&R) and marketing in 2012,
  equalling some 30% of their global revenues.11 1336 feature films were produced in the EU in 2011 alone12
  and in 2012 more than €1 billion was invested in European cinema theatres, revolutionising the big-screen
  experience for fans of any genre.13

 New technologies must foster creativity, quality content and legal access, not hinder them: copyright
  ensures that content creators can license their work, and so be confident in advance of making a living and a
  return on their endeavours.

 Copyright is a fundamental right that promotes cultural diversity and safeguards creators’ livelihoods. The
  right to property, including intellectual property, is enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Art.
  17.2). In an EU that is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law, weakening the copyright
  framework may raise constitutional issues at both the EU and national levels.

                                 Creativity Works! Positions on Key Themes


Territoriality

 As experience goods14 and services, creative works are conceived, created, produced and marketed to
  respond to specific linguistic and cultural markets and tastes. In an EU of 28 Member States and 24 national
  languages (plus as many as 65 regional and minority languages), creative works need to be edited, curated,
  mediatised,15adapted and promoted separately for each cultural market. This process requires substantial
  investment and cultural adaptation.
 The territorial nature of copyright allows for multi-territorial licensing when and where appropriate in terms
  of the specific financial structure of each sector, the specific nature and economic viability of the works
  concerned, as well as market demand.16
 Cross-border access to content is already a reality in the EU,17 when driven by consumer demand. According
  to a recent economic study focused on the audiovisual sector, however, the demand for foreign language TV
  programmes remains low and is limited to migrant populations or expatriates, representing only 3.3% of the
  total European population.18
 Exclusive rights and contractual freedom are fundamental to the delicate ecosystem of creation and its
  financing. They spread risk, enable different players to work together to the benefit of a diverse audience, and
  incentivise investment in the production of professional high-quality content.19
 The territorial nature of copyright enables the sustainable development of the creative and cultural
  industries in Europe. Moreover, the Court of Justice of the European Union has repeatedly confirmed that the
  principle of territoriality is recognised in international copyright law, to which both the EU and its member
  states are bound to.20


Term of Protection:

 The current term of protection has become the international norm, the ultimate beneficiary of which is, in
  fact, the public domain itself.21
 The current term of protection provides for a suitable period of time during which right holders may reap the
  full benefits of their works – this is of particular importance to emerging and specialist authors and creators –
  while also promoting investments and securing returns.
 A shorter term would not be in the EU’s economic interest and would undermine investment in copyrighted
  works by the creative sectors.



Exceptions and limitations

 The current European system of copyright exceptions and limitations strikes the right balance. It enables
  respect for cultural and national diversity, flexibility and an appropriate degree of EU harmonisation.
 In the absence of compelling evidence demonstrating the need for change, the existing system of copyright
  exceptions and limitations should be maintained. Copyright should continue to serve the public interest by
  fostering incentives to create, finance, market and distribute new works and to make those works available to
  the public in new, innovative and compelling ways.
 Any new exception or limitation introduced to the EU copyright legal system needs to be justified by a sound
  economic and legal analysis.



                                                                                                                 3
Exhaustion

 The Copyright Directive is very clear that “the question of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and
  online services in particular” and that “every online service is in fact an act which should be subject to
  authorisation where the copyright or related rights so provide.”22Article 3.3 of the EU Copyright Directive
  further confirms that exhaustion does not apply to the right of communication to the public of works and the
  right of making available to the public.
 A regime of “digital exhaustion” based on a concept of “forward and delete” is unworkable in practice as it is
  not possible to verify and/or manage transfers of digital content. And in the absence of any physical wear and
  tear of the resold item, exhaustion would harm the business model of the copyright owner and would be
  incompatible with international norms to which the EU and Member States are bound.
 Digital files do not deteriorate over time like physical copies do. One purchased digital copy could potentially
  be resold millions of times on the secondary market, which would – as a direct effect – destroy the primary
  market.
 Digital exhaustion thus has no place in an environment that is increasingly founded on licensing and cloud-
  based services. If the online market place is to thrive, right holders must be able to manage new business
  models based on licensing flexibility and innovative offers. Licensed digital works and services offer exciting
  user experiences, for example enabling consumers to enjoy licensed copies of creative content on multiple
  formats and platforms.


Respect for Rights/Enforcement

 Rights only have value if they are respected. Effective enforcement plays an important part in ensuring respect
  for rights. It also creates the vital certainty that underpins investment and leads to growth, jobs and the
  dissemination of knowledge.
 But enforcement is just one component of the solution to address widespread infringement, and a
  comprehensive approach is needed to ensure that property rights, access to justice, freedom of expression
  and data protection are all guaranteed and properly protected.


Single Copyright Title

 A single EU Copyright Title would be a complex proposal and needs careful and long-term consideration.
 Additionally, it could raise competency issues. Such a massive undertaking as a Single EU Copyright Title might
  pose problems with regards to subsidiarity and proportionality principles.

  For example, in the audiovisual sector, the ability to raise financing through the sale of future distribution rights is
essential to secure sufficient funds to produce new works. Case studies have shown that the contribution made by
international pre-sales to a total film production budget can rise to 66%. (http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-
