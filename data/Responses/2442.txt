                                  EUROPEAN UNION
                  COPYRIGHT/ DIGITAL MUSIC RIGHTS INITIATIVE

                                   POSITION PAPER
By Ian Penman of New Media Law LLP in consultation with Suzanne Rab, barrister
                                                     of Serle Court Chambers.
                                                               1 February 2014


   1. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This paper responds to the European Commission’s 5 December 2013 public
consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules (“Consultation”). It focuses on the
specific issue of fair remuneration for authors and creators in the music industry and how
this can be safeguarded to meet the challenges of the digital age.
Below we outline a proposal which we believe is both visionary and pragmatic. It echoes
the sentiments of Internal Market and Services Commissioner Michel Barnier in
launching the Consultation where he stated that his:
        "…vision of copyright is of a modern and effective tool that supports creation and
       innovation, enables access to quality content, including across borders,
       encourages investment and strengthens cultural diversity”.
We emphatically agree with Commissioner Barnier that “[o]ur EU copyright policy must
keep up with the times”.
The European Union’s objectives in the area of copyright (as apparent from this
Consultation) can be summarised as being to “improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright
reform”. This objective is supported by growing the European Union economy through
attracting e-commerce related business to the European Union. This, in turn, will also
contribute to diversification of the EU economy in the online environment.
In pursuit of this objective we propose a mechanism whereby a music distribution fee will
be collected from Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) relating to the upload or download
of music files (“Proposal”). We outline:
   ·   The policy drivers against which the Proposal must be assessed, taking
       account of the specific features of the music industry and as it has developed in
       the EU
   ·   The current ‘status quo’ and how existing legal mechanisms and policy
       instruments have so far failed to deliver an optimum environment for protecting
       the interests of rights-holders and consistent with encouraging new business
       models to flourish




                                                                                           1
   ·   An assessment of the position of relevant market players (including record
       companies, publishers, ISPs, music collection royalty societies and retailers) and
       how the Proposal would affect their and consumers’ interests
   ·   An outline of how the Proposal would work in practice
   ·   Key benefits of the Proposal to the EU.
The key features of the Proposal include:
   1. PLATFORM NEUTRAL: The proposed scheme is "platform neutral", in that it is
      not in competition with, nor does it "favour", any existing (nor indeed, future)
      business models for the online use of music.
   2. NOT A TAX: The fees collected by the ISPs would be passed to the rights-
      holders on a basis yet to be finalised, but it would be pro rata to actual use of the
      files, where possible, using audio fingerprinting technology, and/ or rights-holder
      metadata, as supplied by the collecting societies and/ or the rights-holders
      themselves.
   3. NOT A “BLANKET LICENCE”: The proposed initiative does not therefore permit
      nor automatically license all file sharing, and is limited to individual non-
      commercial uses only.
   4. COPYRIGHT LAW: The EU is considering the wider review of its current
      copyright laws and may indeed introduce new digital copyright legislation in order
      to address the current realities in respect of the use of digital music files,
      including the transfer of those files using the Internet. The Proposal does not
      seek to supplant that review and can be achieved in harmony with it.


   2. EUROPEAN UNION POLICY DRIVERS
The European Union’s policy has been (and continues to be) to offer attractive
legislative, tax and business environments to industries in order to build business
clusters in the European Union, which then in turn attract other businesses to the
European Union.
One of the key areas which the European Union has identified as being a growth area in
the future and in respect of which the European Union can offer this advantageous
business environment – is the online content industry – notably online delivery of music,
television and film.
The European Union’s unique constitutional position, when coupled with its political
willingness to adapt to change, allows it to be able to react rapidly to the challenges
offered by new technology, and find practical solutions to existing challenges – which will
assist these industries in their successful future growth and economic development.
Of the creative industries, the industry which has been most affected to date by the
growth of the Internet, and notably the proliferation of broadband services, is the music
industry. The reason for this is simply that music can be easily digitised (and has been


                                                                                            2
since the invention of the compact disc in the 1980s), and (when this digitisation is
combined with the arrival of powerful compression technology, as has been the case
since the early 1990s) that the resulting music files are (relatively) small, and can
therefore be transmitted across the Internet with ease.


   3. CURRENT BACKGROUND
Sadly, for a number of interrelated and complex reasons (which have been rehearsed
extensively elsewhere and which will not be repeated here), the music industry has
failed to react to the change of technology by which consumers obtain music, which has
resulted in a number of unlicensed new technologies becoming the most popular routes
for these consumers to obtain their content.
An obvious challenge is peer to peer technology (“P2P”). Of course, until recently, it has
been only the younger generations that have understood and adopted these
technologies in large numbers. However, as the music industry has continually failed to
(initially acknowledge, and then) address the new environment for over a decade, those
younger generations have grown up (though not necessarily becoming legitimate, i.e.
paying, consumers in the process), and been replaced by the next [technologically
savvy] generation, who also prefer to obtain their music using these technologies, not
least of course, because they are [almost] free. Almost free, because substantial fees
are paid to service providers (such as Telcos and ISPs) who supply the technical
connections over which the consumer can obtain their content.
Unfortunately, as a result of the music industry’s failure to deal with reality, the ISPs and
Telcos do not – at present – tend to charge their customers for the content that they
obtain using their telecommunication services – nor pay any money to the copyright
holders that are being adversely affected.
This has resulted in the recorded music industry collapsing in the throes of a well-
publicised meltdown. Whilst music revenues from broadcast, film and public
performance are strong. For example, as regards the UK PRS for Music reported that
broadcast revenues from TV and radio reached £153 million in 2012, a rise of 3.1% on
2011), recorded music revenue (from the sale of master recordings to individual end
consumers), and related mechanical copyright revenues) are struggling (overall PRS for
Music achieved a 0.6% rise in royalty revenues from recorded music in 2012). One of
the main reasons for this slowdown (but not the only reason) is the proliferation of illegal
P2P traffic via broadband connections, which allow users to source and download
infinite quantities of music files at no cost – and with no appreciable loss of quality when
compared with paid services.




   4. POSITIONS OF THE VARIOUS PLAYERS

                                                                                            3
4.1    Record Companies
The majors (and the major independents) resist change. Many thought that the windfall
(in that they were able to sell the same products again, as had previously been bought in
pressed vinyl and/ or magnetic tape form) revenue brought about by the invention of CD
technology would see them well into retirement. It didn’t happen. Unfortunately, the
digitisation of (what were previously) analogue music recordings has led to other
consequences – when coupled with compression and Internet technologies.
That said, the development which appears to scare them the most is the loss of their
monopoly on distribution. Previously, each of the majors (and via companies like
Pinnacle, the independents) had a stranglehold on the distribution of recorded music.
Each of them owned their own distribution network, which commenced with the actual
manufacture of the product, through the storage and distribution warehouses, to the
delivery to the retail shops that sold the product to the consumer. This allowed them to
control supply, and therefore price.
The move to the Internet being consumers’ preferred method of consumption of
recorded music has meant that their distribution monopoly has been broken. They have
fought this at every step of the way, with rather similar results to those enjoyed by King
Canute when he tried to stop the waves.
However, by choosing to fight, as opposed to accept the inevitable (which history shows
us is almost always the case when a massive technological change occurs to any
business) and embrace it – has meant that consumers have been forced to adopt illegal
services, if they wish to consume their music in the way that they prefer.
By choosing to continue the fight, when it became obvious to all dispassionate
observers that they would inevitably lose it, the loss of initiative gradually transpired into
a catastrophic and [predominantly] permanent loss of consumer loyalty, which is where
they are today.
Yet they still seem to refuse to acknowledge that the ISPs and Telcos are the de facto
“gatekeepers” of the new distribution network, and that their old distribution model needs
to be revised accordingly.
They should be encouraging the ISPs to hold “stocks” of their products (via a database
of digital files, supplied to them by the record companies), and should then be
encouraging them (and/ or other online music services) to sell the products to the
consumer (whether via digital downloads to own, or to use for a time, or via streaming
services).
The main reasons that they should be focused on the ISPs are that: (a) they ‘own’ or
have the direct nexus with the customer, and have proven revenue collection systems;
(b) in terms of [prevention of] copyright infringement – they have the ability to [largely]
stop it immediately, using current technology; and (c) they can enforce payment, and
indeed copyright adherence - as they can “switch the user off”.
The new business models can be individual purchase or subscription services – it
doesn’t matter which. Obviously, iTunes has led the way in this – but unfortunately, its


                                                                                                 4
model is not economically viable in itself – or in relation to the revenues delivered to the
rights holders. It only works if you own the rights to and sell lots of iPods.
Which brings us to the current “impasse”: we know from meetings with the record
company industry associations that they feel that a suitable pricing model (for “infinite”
access to recorded music via a broadband connection) would be in the region of EUR 15
per user per month. When combined with the publishers’ requirements (for the licence
of their songs) of a further (say) EUR 3 to 7 per month, it is easy to see why the ISPs
have so far refused to listen. They may well charge about the same cost per month,
gross, to their customers – as the music industry would like to see for the licence of its
rights. An impossible equation.
This has resulted in the ISP collecting 100% of the income from the download of music
(by providing the technical solution at a cost which they keep themselves, for the
consumer to then obtain music via almost exclusively illegal and therefore unpaid
services).
The only logical step forward is for the record companies to accept the current reality,
and start to get paid for some of what is actually going on. Anything has to be better
than nothing. Of course, the initial equation will be grossly unfair to them (or at least this
is how they will perceive it), but then again, had they been prepared to try to understand
(let alone embrace) the technological change brought about by the invention of the
Internet when it became universally adopted – they may have been better placed to
lobby governments at the time for a share of ISP revenues (being that the ISPs were,
arguably innocently at first, inevitably facilitating copyright theft on a vast scale).
Put simply: they have to be “in it to win it”. ISPs are not going to go away, nor are
modern consumers – who have voted with their feet as to how they wish to consume
music. The distribution fee may start at a relatively small price per month per access
point. The record companies may not universally accept this as yet – but the
commercial logic is inescapable.
However, it is this lack of universal acceptance which is why we have developed the
Proposal. The record companies’ vary in their attitude to an ISP-based model right now
between: “we do not support it” through “we will accept a “covenant not to sue” to “we
will licence it now”. Any attempt to find harmony among the recorded music industry has
thus far failed, and we cannot yet see any [bright] light at the end of the tunnel. In effect,
any model which demands that the record companies license their rights – will not yet
find acceptance from most of them [certainly not as currently priced] – and is therefore
destined to fail. It is for this reason that we recommend that a “music distribution fee” is
charged of the ISPs – without it being related to individual products or licenses of rights.


4.2    Publishers
As with the record companies, the publishers have seen their revenues from sales of
recordings collapse. If nobody is paying for recordings, then nobody is paying the
mechanical copyright royalty to the writer of the underlying work, not to mention the
performer’s performance right.


                                                                                               5
They have (perhaps) been better able to weather the storm than the record companies,
because they do not traditionally have anything like the same product development
costs. They do not invest in making records, nor in the [increasingly huge] costs
involved in bringing them to market. One major record company MD told us that he
thought that it would be impossible to launch a new pop act in the UK market alone for
less than EUR 1,000,000. It doesn’t take much to realise that they only need a few
failures for their profits to collapse. This collapse is like a downward only spiral - and is
happening faster and faster – as they can no longer recoup the losses incurred by the
[numerous] failures from the one or two successes – as consumers are no longer paying
for the successful music. As the record companies collapse, so does the mechanical
income paid to publishers.
We have anecdotal soundings that publishers are now more than willing to consider any
model which will address the existing disaster. We have every reason to believe,
therefore, that the publishers will support the Proposal and indeed will encourage their
collection societies to not only approve it – but to get actively involved.
4.3    ISPs
The ISPs have always taken the position that they are “innocent disseminators” of
content by third parties using their networks. In that they do not monitor the content that
crosses their networks, but merely provide “pipes” through which data can be received
and sent. This position, partially as it reflects the previous position taken by
governments in respect of what were originally purely telephone and telegraphic
networks, is more or less supported by EU and US law (eg the safe harbour provisions
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 2000 in the US, and the ‘mere conduit’ status
of ISPs in Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce).
However, as technological advances have meant that larger and larger files can be sent
and received more and more rapidly using the ISP/ Telco technologies, it has meant that
the ISP/ Telcos have become the de facto distributors of much of the world’s content.
This has made their traditional position (of “innocent disseminators”) less and less
tenable. It is not only music that has been affected, but the software, book, magazine,
newspaper, television and film industries have also seen their content increasingly
infringed – with resultant losses in income.
Whilst the ISPs (in particular) have had the necessary [file identification and blocking]
technology available for some time to address this – they have been loath to deploy it (it
makes their job far harder, and nobody is offering to pay them to do the additional work).
Thus, they have chosen instead to continue to “cash in” on the inertia of the content
industries (and the world’s politicians). Why should they voluntarily accept all of this
additional cost, or indeed share their revenues, when they can continue happily on
without doing either. As Geoff Taylor (Chairman of the BPI) famously said in the press:
“My door has been open to the ISPs for years, but they don’t seem to want to walk
through it”. Now we know why.
In the European Union the position is different, as the European Union’s ISPs seem far
more receptive to recognising what is going on. This may be aided by the fact that they
are not making additional fees out of bulk infringers who swallow up vast quantities of
bandwidth by leaving their bit torrent applications to download hundreds of illegal files on

                                                                                            6
a 24/7 basis, which also significantly degrades the ISPs service experience to their
legitimate customers.
Whatever their motive, the result is that the European Union’s ISPs are prepared to
contemplate this new “fee”, provided of course that it is not set at an unrealistically
high level.
The irony is that the European Union is probably one of the few jurisdictions in the world
that may not need to legislate to bring their ISPs to the table – as the ISPs know before
discussions commence – that it easily can. This “willingness” means that a solution can
be found and implemented rapidly in the European Union, which will serve as a model
for the rest of the world.
4.4    Music Royalty Collection Societies
In respect of online income collection and distribution, the collection societies that deal
with income from the sale of recordings and/ or songs are frightened about their future.
Or at least those who understand how and why copyright works will be licensed and
distributed online in the future (with the resultant effect on how income will be collected
and distributed) are. This is because the current status quo (being national societies
handling national collections in respect of their members) cannot work in the online
environment.
The societies (that collect and distribute income) fall into two categories (as, of course,
do music copyright works themselves), namely: those dealing with sound recordings (eg
PPL) and those dealing with the publishing of underlying works (or songs) (eg PRS or
MCPS).
The complexities of online licensing in Europe are legendary. PPL, for example, does
not usually have a mandate from its members to deal with the online licensing of sound
recordings (they are licensed by the rights-holders themselves), whereas the publishing
licenses are in most cases still dealt with on a national basis. This is not standard,
however, as proven in the case of CELAS (the new society, which is a “joint venture”
between MCPS and GEMA [in Germany] which was set up to handle the online licensing
of EMI publishing copyrights throughout Europe. Or has it?
On closer examination, the Dutch and the Spanish are apparently refusing to
acknowledge that these rights have been effectively transferred to CELAS, and even if
they have, the rights of a local Spanish, German or Dutch writer that co-writes with an
EMI Anglo-American writer are not included. Others state that the “performing right” is
not included (such that the CELAS licence is just for “mechanical copyright” use).
Chaos. And the apparent positions that are stated here are based on what can be
gleaned from dealings with the societies and public sources “so far as can be
ascertained”.
We have calculated that (at least) 35 licences are required to license just the publishing
rights for a new online music business model that wishes to launch in (say) 5 major
European countries (namely, a “pan-European” licence from each of the major catalogue
owners – i.e. Warner Chappell, Universal, Sony ATV/ EMI (via CELAS), plus a further
licence (in respect of their own members’ works) from the national collection society of


                                                                                              7
each of the 31 EEA members [the EEA currently comprises the 28 members of the EU
plus Norway (29), Iceland (30) and Liechtenstein (31), and then Switzerland (32) which
is neither an EU nor an EEA member]). Of course, if the European Union is included as
a separate European territory – this figure becomes 36!
The result of all this is that the collection society position will have to be rationalised, or
the result will be that income will dry up because either: (a) new models will simply
refuse to licence (ie, stay illegal), or (b) new models will find it too complex and
expensive to launch at all.
The cure will be a new model society for online licensing, which the European
Union’s initiative will set up – and which will lead the way on a worldwide basis.
Once this lead has been taken, it is logical that the European Union’s model will
be utilised not only in respect of other national (or supra national) collection, but
also in respect of the pan-European (or indeed global) rights of the major rights
holders. Put simply, the European Union will be ideally positioned to offer the
collection and distribution structure to the majors, who could collect all of their
global online income via a European Union company in a tax efficient manner.
We know, from one collection society, for example, that the European rights societies
are in the process of implementing regional “hubs” in order to streamline online
collection and payment. If the European Union becomes the first international hub which
is geographically located in Europe, but without actually being an EU or EEA member,
then it could easily become the logical “entry point” into what will eventually become a
global network of collection and payment hubs.
5.5       Retailers (high street and online)
Traditional content retailers are suffering terribly from the current environment (eg the
collapse of Woolworths, which has always had a significant proportion of music (and
indeed DVD) sales income in the UK). They would welcome any change along the lines
of the recommended initiative, as one of its effects will be to boost hard copy sales.
Online suppliers fall into 2 distinct camps: Those who are prepared to work illegally, or
at least on the edge of legality – eg [the original] Napster, MyMP3.Com, Limewire or
Pirate Bay; and those who obtain legitimate licenses, eg iTunes, Amazon, Qtrax or
Rhapsody. The former would prefer that the current anarchy continues, for obvious
reasons, whilst the latter will be 100% supportive of the initiative (once they fully
understand it) – as one of its net effects will be to drive consumers through their doors
(provided of course that it does not increase their running costs, which it should not).




      5. RECOMMENDED MODEL – “DIGITAL MUSIC RIGHTS INITIATIVE”
Bearing in mind the above, our recommended model is as follows:
MUSIC DISTRIBUTION FEE
      ·   a “MUSIC DISTRIBUTION FEE” is charged to the ISP and Telcos

                                                                                                  8
    ·   set (initially) at EUR 3 per access point per month
    ·   in return for the fee – the ISP/ Telco would be given more certain “safe harbour”
        protection – whether by legislation or MoU (thereby making them immune from
        prosecution in respect of individual [i.e. non-commercial] music download activity
        across their networks)
    ·   whether the fee is passed through to the consumer would be at the option of the
        ISP or Telco. While consumers may end up paying more in the short-term,
        competition between ISPs would eventually negate this. It is inevitable that there
        would be a period of ‘bedding in’ while consumers get used to the fee and the
        dichotomy between their respect for IP and the hitherto availability of ‘free’
        downloads. It is probable that ISPs would eventually eat the costs over time due
        the very obvious PR benefits to them in so doing1
    ·   it is not a tax because the fee does not go to any public or government authority;
    ·   it is not a “licence” [“blanket” or otherwise] as it does not require the permission
        of the content owners (as it does not give any permission to any end user to
        download music – whether illegally or legally – thus existing lawful services [such
        as iTunes] are unaffected – as are the content owner’s rights to sue blatant
        infringers)
    ·   it would only be related to music content – so films and TV programmes would
        not be included
    ·   the fee is payable by the ISP or Telco to a new European Union company –
        provisionally titled MUSIC RIGHTS MANAGEMENT LTD (the “Company”)
    ·   this Company would be a “not for profit” company – similar in principle to the
        existing collection societies – such as PRS for Music or PPL
    ·   the Company would contract with an existing “fingerprint” technology provider –
        such as Audible Magic or AMG – who would install technology sitting on the ISP
        or Telco’s network – which would identify most of the music downloads – and
        allow a “fair” distribution of the income to take place [ideally, this provider would
        be paid a percentage – in the order of 2% - of the gross revenue raised]
    ·   the Company would contract with one or more existing collection societies (eg
        PRS for Music) to distribute the funds raised to the relevant rights-holders (using
        their existing rights holders databases – which would be interfaced with the
        fingerprinting technology) [ideally this society would be paid a percentage of the
        gross revenue raised – in the order of 5%]
    ·   the Company would also retain a percentage of the gross revenue raised – to
        cover its costs – in the order of 3%. This would mean that the total “cost” of the
        scheme (i.e. to be deducted from the rights holder “royalty” would be capped at
        10%).




1
  96% of Europeans agree that protecting IP is important; 86% agree that protecting IP
contributes to improving the quality of products and services; and 69% value IP because it
contributes to the creation of jobs and economic well-being. 42% also believe it is acceptable to
illegally download music and films for personal use. This rises to 57% among those aged
between 15 and 24-years-old. See, further:
https://oami.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/ip-studies

                                                                                                    9
At present, as the end user/ individual consumer is unaffected by the above model –
there would be no specific necessity to change European Union copyright law – insofar
as it relates to individuals.
That said, in the event that the ISPs/ Telcos decide to pass through this charge to their
customers, there may be pressure to deliver some benefit to those customers (such as
an additional “safe harbour” immunity from prosecution if they are making digital copies
of music files at home for their own [non-commercial] use). Again, this is doing nothing
more than (effectively) recognising the existing status quo.
However, it should not be ignored that if the initiative included this modification – it would
bring enormous [we believe positive] publicity to the European Union – as being the first
jurisdiction in the world to modernise its copyright law to “embrace reality” and reflect the
new consumer environment that has been brought about by new technology. This also
follows through on the European Union’s strategic objectives – by sending out the right
“message” to the world’s online business community – who would see the European
Union as being the best [i.e. most forward thinking] environment in the world for
conducting their business.
However, both suggested changes to European Union copyright legislation (i.e. the
extending of safe harbour guarantees to both the ISPs/ Telcos and the individual
consumer), would undoubtedly be seen as an “erosion” of their current rights by the
rights-holders, notably the major record companies. As a result, we propose that they
are “given” something in return:
EUROPEAN ONLINE COPYRIGHT TRIBUNAL
As a further arm to the initiative – we would recommend the following:
   ·   The European Union sets up a European Online Copyright Tribunal (“EOCT”).
   ·   This would be managed by the Company.
   ·   Rights holders would be given a swift and effective forum for addressing blatant
       [online] infringers of copyright.
   ·   The EOCT would be granted power to enforce judgments in relation to European
       Union ISPs immediately.
   ·   Part of the statutory change (or MoU) referred to above would ensure that the
       ISPs carried out any block required by the judgment immediately.
   ·   “Action costs” and “court” fees would be charged to the litigants by the OCT - the
       former of which would contribute to the EOCT’s running costs and the latter of
       which would be paid through to the European Union budget as fees.


Not only would this be a “world first” (which would bring enormous positive publicity to
the European Union) – it would be seen as a perfect low cost and low risk test bed
environment for the major rights-holders to address bulk infringers – whether those who
are illegally distributing their content – or those who are providing the technology for
others to do so. Of course, this would have the beneficial side effect of bringing new and
positive income to the European Union – as the world’s major content companies come
to the European Union to benefit from the EOCT regime.


                                                                                           10
    6. BENEFITS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
If the European Union implements this initiative, it will be the first jurisdiction in the world
to successfully address the current chaos caused to the creative - and especially music -
industries by the theft of copyright works online.
This has the following significant benefits to the European Union:
The EU’s international/ business status
    (1) it further enhances the European Union’s status as a forward thinking country
        which embraces technological change when it is logical to do so;


Positive publicity
    (2) [following on from the undoubted positive publicity that will be generated], the
        European Union will benefit generally from an enormous and lasting positive
        “PR” surge;


The European Union gets a new “Rights Society”
    (3) the new European Union “Music Rights Management” company will mean that
        the European Union begins to collect and distribute its own music royalties for
        the first time (thereby enhancing its status as an “independent” jurisdiction, and
        providing for the monies to be channelled through the European Union – and of
        course for the society administration “fees” to stay in the European Union - for
        the first time);


Further Revenues – Administrative and Technical and Banking
    (4) the model that the initiative creates can easily be duplicated for other royalty
        streams – such as those that will eventually become necessary for other digital
        content industries (eg films, books, software etc…), and for other commercial
        entities (such as “Warner Music Digital Co”, “Universal Music Digital Co” etc…),
        who would logically choose the European Union’s world leading online rights
        management infrastructure to be the perfect solution to their own online digital
        rights income management, via the establishment of European Union companies
        to undertake the relevant tasks. This could end up with a gigantic revenue boost
        to the European Union’s economy, as each of these new initiatives and
        commercial companies will require an admin base in the European Union, and
        will mean that the revenues are channelled through the European Union’s banks;


Protection of Creators
    (5) the European Union can be seen to be protecting its creative community, whose
        income will otherwise be gradually eroded by the continued mass infringement of
        their copyright works that the current inertia allows;

                                                                                             11
Consumer Benefits

   (6) [to the extent that an additional “safe harbour” is established] immunity from
       prosecution if consumers are making digital copies of music files at home for
       their own [non-commercial] use).


It is for the above reasons that we recommend further examination of the issues set out
here with a view to the adoption of this Digital Music Rights Initiative.
