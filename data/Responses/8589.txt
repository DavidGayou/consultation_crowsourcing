Introduction
Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:

Name:
EMI Music Publishing Polska Sp. z o.o. is Polish affiliate of EMI  -  worldwide leading music publisher. EMI Music Publishing Polska is associated in ICMP.

ICMP is the world trade association representing the interests of the music publishing community internationally.  Constituent members of ICMP are music publishers' associations from Europe, Middle East, North and South America, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Included are the leading independent multinational and international companies and regional and national music publishers, mainly SMEs, throughout the world.  

ICMP speaks out on behalf of music publishers across the world to safeguard their creative and economic interests and to help them meet new and emerging challenges in the music business. Our mission is to protect and promote copyright and to represent industry positions at international, regional and local levels. We achieve this by being vocal advocates for our members in various political and regulatory arenas and by fostering a global community for music publishers to share best practice and experience.

Music publishers provide a bridge between the creative process and the market. In addition to being rightsholders, music publishers are the ultimate representatives of authors and composers. Music publishers are a key player in the music industry business. Our role is to discover, nurture, develop and promote authors and composers.  Our core business is licensing, through which we are able to ensure that the works of the authors and composers find a commercial outlet and we guarantee that their creative output is rewarded by arranging contracts and protecting copyrighted music. The economic importance of the licensing of intellectual property rights is crucial. Our members' business is based on these rights. 

Adapting to market needs has allowed music publishing to continue to realise its creative mission on behalf of its composers and authors.  Commercial success and the ability to secure an adequate reward from those that benefit from music is the force behind new investment in musical creation and the nurturing of new works.  Music publishers are active and involved in every single form of exploitation of the musical work.

To invest in new markets and promote new emerging talent, a secure legal framework needs to be in place. Above all, copyright - the ability of composers, lyricists and performers to financially gain from their life's work and passion - must be upheld. Without adequate reward, the creative instinct would largely go unrealised, leaving the world a culturally poorer place. Music publishers are only able to invest in talent if they can get compensated for their rights.  Developing talent is an expensive and risky business.

Europe has a strong tradition of promoting culture for the benefit of society. An inseparable part of this tradition is the system of copyright which has successfully protected and encouraged development of world leading cultural expression for the benefit of cultural development worldwide.  Any discussion of copyright in Europe today takes place within this important heritage which has brought European music, literature and other cultural content to the forefront of world thought.

EMI therefore welcomes any initiative aimed at ensuring that copyright remains a modern and effective tool to support creation and innovation; to enable access to quality content across the borders; and to foster investment in our economy and cultural diversity. However, we believe that copyright should not be weakened so that others can develop and benefit from new commercial services free of cost.    

In this regard, we stand ready to enter into dialogue with the European Commission on this issue, which is crucial for our future, and we are happy for the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation. 

Publishers believe however that it would be premature to come up with measures aimed at changing the foundations of the current copyright framework, intervening in those areas where there are legislative initiatives on the table or that have just been adopted and that can help to improve the current situation and the perceived problems (e.g. CRM, Orphan Works, etc). In relation to issues subject to the Licences for Europe process, we believe that a wide range of market based solutions were shown to be already in place and/or in the process of being implemented in addition to the industry pledges made.  We think that it would be wise to wait and see how the industry pledges are implemented and whether they help to improve the current licensing situation, where needed, and to allow the market to continue to find solutions organically as it is doing and as it has always done. We firmly believe that any change in the current EU Copyright framework should be accompanied by solid evidence of existing problems.  We have seen no such evidence.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Music publishers are granting multi-territorial licenses on a daily basis and for many thousands of products every year. As a way of example, iTunes, YouTube, Spotify & Amazon are all licensed on a multi territory basis. Licenses for online commercials are, by nature, usually worldwide. Most TV and film licenses cover several European territories. Licenses for download, streaming or other digital services are offered on a pan-European basis. It should be noted, however, that in most cases users do not want licenses for multiple territories as their marketing campaigns or digital services are only intended for one or a few territories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Pro Music website, ICMP and other organisations working across the music sector show where licensed music services around the world can be found. As the time of writing, there are more than 500 licensed music services worldwide that enable consumers to download, stream or access music legally.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First and foremost, EMI would like to emphasise that the existing copyright framework has, and, continues to enable the development of diverse and numerous licensing models at a European level. EMI Publishing does not therefore accept that the issues identified by the Commission (territoriality of rights; clearing rights in different territories and contractual clauses in licensing agreements) create difficulties in accessing online content services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the Licenses for Europe (LfE) dialogue, music rightsholders were able to demonstrate that under the current EU legal framework and under the current market circumstances, digital music services have developed greatly in the last few years and that the market continues to grow. We were also able to prove that, contrary to some views, national repertoire from all EU Member States is widely and legally available throughout the EU. It is simply not true that there are significant problems with cross border portability of content and that consumers face considerable problems when trying to access services purchased from one EU Member State to the other. The presentations in LfE WG1 showed that portability is provided by online services when travelling or residing abroad, including downloading MP3 on any device, synchronising through cloud storage and streaming. We also proved that access to playlists of services abroad is possible. When limitations exist to cross-border services, they are the result of each service's operational needs and intention to meet consumer demand by adapting to local markets. However, consumer demand for cross border access is nevertheless met because the main music services which are available in every country have all international and local repertoires.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as copyright clearance is concerned, we believe that after the now imminent adoption of the EU Directive on Collective Rights Management, its implementation across the 28 Member States will help foster a single European digital market for music allowing for the competing licensing platforms to continue to develop and aggregate further repertoire. It would be premature to jump to conclusions before this Directive is adopted and implemented at national level, and specific measures are undertaken by collective management organisations (CMOs) to comply with implementing legislation. In relation to the issue of the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
acquisition of rights, participants of the music sector in LfE presented licensing solutions to continue to streamline multi-territorial licensing through industry led initiatives. For example, the Armonia project was presented as a current functioning innovative solution and Global Repertoire Database (GRD) was presented as a key business tool to provide the necessary data ownership information to support the administration of licences for the use of musical works. Record producers presented a licensing scheme for multi-territorial Internet transmission of radio programmes. It is to be noted that all of these initiatives were considered useful by users during the LfE discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, we do not consider territoriality of copyright as an obstacle to accessing content. The territorial nature of copyright has been recognised for centuries, including by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and it neither encourages nor impedes cross border trade, nor is it an obstacle to the Single Market. As mentioned above, our members are already licensing multi-territorially. The territorial application of copyright does not preclude EU-wide or cross-border licensing models. Whatever perceived restrictions there may be to the access of content cross border are always the result of a commercial decision to engage in single or multi-territorial licensing. This decision is made on the basis of informed choices by users with due consideration for local demand (cultural preferences, language, etc.).  WE would ask for caution before blaming territorial rights, licensing and the rights clearance activity as potential obstacles to cross border e-commerce.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, there are other factors unrelated to the issues outlined by the Commission that pose challenges to the cross border availability of content services in the Single Market. These factors are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Piracy: It is one of the most important factors hindering the development of the market. In this regard, we think it is important that measures aimed at counteracting illegal access to copyright protected works, including enforcement and cooperation with intermediaries are effectively implemented in those EU Member States where they are still missing (i.e. Article 8.3 of the EU Copyright Directive and the related Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, and Articles 12 to 15 of the E-Commerce Directive). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cultural and linguistic differences: Although some stakeholders consider them as an obstacle, such differences are what make Europe truly culturally diverse, a characteristic that we all should cherish. The EU Single Market is not "single", but rather a compilation of diverse multicultural markets where local and niche repertoires are still crucially important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other obstacles are a non-harmonised system of taxation and accounting standards, the lack of a reduced VAT for the delivery of online cultural products, the slow developments in the areas of micro-payments, digital signatures, broadband infrastructure, etc. These have also been recognised by the Commission as standing in the way of the completion of the Single Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To conclude, the aim of policy makers should be to improve cooperation between European institutions and all stakeholders in the value chain to ensure a successful digital single market for the benefit of all (rightsholders, users and European consumers). Any changes to the current legal framework need to be based on solid economic and legal evidence that the current system is not working. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not impose territorial restrictions. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As explained in questions 3 and 4 above, when limitations exist to cross-border services, they are the result of each service's operational needs and intention to meet consumer demand by adapting to local markets. The reasons for this vary; testing business models, infrastructure costs, establishing relationships with local ISPs and advertisers, the need for a local presence to provide tailored content, etc. There are examples in the EU where some services have chosen to launch in all the EU Member States at the same time while others which are almost identical have chosen to launch in different territories at different times. The result is that the latter is proving much more successful. This shows how the choice of a service to launch in a specific territory is based on different factors other than the difficulty in clearing rights. Services need to take time to establish a relationship with local partners, (sometimes this takes longer than expected due to the local quasi-monopolies of certain ISPs, for example), carry out market studies of consumer behaviour, etc.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As rightsholders, music publishers do not impose territorial restrictions  -  they respond to the demands of the online service providers. Of course they can only license for the territories they represent but in these cases service providers can still obtain the rights from the appropriate rightsholder. Music publishers have the incentive to licence for as broad a territory as possible since this will increase the revenue. The user may elect however to obtain a licence only for the territories where there is market demand so that the price they pay is less. For example, in the commercial syncs market, the payment is closely related to the size of the market being addressed and the advertiser wishes to limit its campaign to a curtained defined territory. By limiting the territory, users are able to get a licence for the use of the requested song at a lower rate than if they were required to offer the use to all the EEA. This is because a song may have a separate commercial value, perhaps to a competing producer, in the remaining territories. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the above, there is no legal reason to restrict the ability of a rightsholder to control the exploitation of his work and to limit it geographically. Indeed, the Coditel I and II Cases were clear when they stated that "the rules of the Treaty cannot in principle constitute an obstacle to the geographical limits which the parties to a contract of assignment have agreed upon in order to protect the author and his assigns in this regard."  Furthermore, "a contract whereby the owner of the copyright in a film grants an exclusive right to exhibit that film for a specific period in the territory of a Member State is not, as such, subject to the prohibition contained in Article 85 of the Treaty".

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to our responses above, we believe that the existing EU copyright framework has been enabling the development of numerous licensing models at European level. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nonetheless, the situation could improve. The most important measure that is needed to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market is inextricably linked to the protection of rightsholders. In order for the Digital Single Market to fully develop, existing measures in relation to piracy and enforcement of IPRs need to be effectively implemented by EU Member States. Rightsholders are doing their part and are busy developing new business models to meet consumer demand in the digital era but piracy continues to be the most important factor hindering the development of the market. Effective implementation of the existing EU laws in this regard will enable the creation of a level playing field and provide incentives for legitimate players to enter the online distribution. Increased cooperation from intermediaries and ensuring that adequate remedies to address illegal websites are available for rightsholders is crucial. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, we call upon the Commission to harmonise the discrepancies in fiscal policy among Member States, particularly in the field of VAT, as they are an obstacle. The introduction of a reduced VAT for the delivery of online cultural products would provide a major consumer boost for the development of the Digital Single Market. We also look forward to developments in the field of micro-payments, digital signatures, diverging advertising standards or restrictions, broadband infrastructure, consumer protection regulations, the online distribution chain, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, we would like to point out a market and industry led initiative that, once in place, will be an instrument to facilitate music licensing: the Global Repertoire Database (see question 19 below). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.   Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WE considers that this concept is sufficiently clear and that no additional measures need to be introduced.  As the consultation document points at lack of clarity in cross border situations, but not in cases of mono-territorial licensing, we assume the European Commission shares our view that the content of the right and the activity/ies it encompasses are clear in the latter (mono-territorial licensing).  The alleged problem and the question thus refer mainly to where such acts take place and not to the scope and the meaning of the right.  We would therefore caution against interventions that while attempting to "clarify" the `where', in practice would limit the `what', i.e. the scope of the right itself.   It is our view that both the "country of origin" and the "targeting" approach limit the scope of the right, interfere with licensing, potentially expropriate protection and create problems of their own, with no apparent benefit.  See in this sense also the recent Commission's Study on the Application of the Information Society Directive. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that multi-territorial licensing should remain based on a market driven approach reliant on strong exclusive rights, contractual freedom and protected by robust enforcement measures in order to meet consumer demand and maintain both the value of the content being delivered and the incentives to further invest in different types of content.  National (and even local) cultures, languages and tastes require specific offers. One size fits all doesn't work in the EU and EMI judges it is a good thing that it doesn't work as it is a sign of a culturally diverse and rich Europe. EU-wide licensing should therefore be encouraged, but it should remain voluntary. Contractual and commercial freedom must be preserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we share the Commission's views that there are practical difficulties linked to the identification of the "country of origin" for internet services, we cannot see any advantages in extending the application of this principle enshrined in the EU Cable and Satellite Directive to the Internet.  Suggesting that once an online service is licensed in one EU territory, for example the territory with which the service provider is most closely linked, that then this license would cover all EU territories, would have tremendous negative consequences for rightsholders, CMOs and licensing solutions. The extension of this principle to the Internet would limit the scope of the making available right. We consider that any potential limitation on this exclusive right would be damaging to the Digital Single Market since it would de-incentivise rightsholders who rely on this right to drive new business models. The "country of origin" principle for online licensing allows for forum shopping and de-localisation, including outside the EU and while trying to address perceived bottlenecks, it creates new ones. This was also recognised by the Commission's Study on the Application of the Information Society Directive. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fact, maybe one should seriously consider whether it is appropriate to maintain such principle at all given, as even the Commission acknowledges in its Green Paper on the online distribution of AV in the EU that "more than fifteen years after the application of the relevant Directive, this approach does not seem to have led to a broad emergence of pan-European satellite broadcasting".  This clearly shows that licensing and territoriality is not an obstacle to the development of pan-European satellite services and there is no evidence showing why the effect in the context of online services would be different. In general terms, satellite broadcasting services that have succeeded are the ones that offer their customers services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tailored to local taste. This is because the EU is made of a compilation of different cultures and languages, and this European cultural diversity is something that we should protect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The concept of targeting is also problematic. For example, would a service provider providing a service in the English language be considered as targeting all the EU or just the UK and Ireland? This needs to be thought through. The CJEU already said that the act takes place "at least" in the targeted country. Therefore limiting it to the target approach only would go against the CJEU interpretation. Secondly it would also create real uncertainties as to what the targeted country is, how to determine it, what happens if it cannot be determined or if the content is accessed illicitly from a non targeted third country. Limiting the scope to the targeting principle would also pose problems in relation to the enforcement of copyright, as when an infringement of copyright takes place, the courts designated would only have jurisdiction limited to the damage that has arisen on the territory deliberately targeted by the infringer. This principle will also cause legal uncertainty as "the target" of the exploitation would need to be defined on a case by case basis.

9.    [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A clarification of the territorial scope of the right would result in its limitation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The right of making available is key to on line licensing and enforcement. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Clarifications" aimed at limiting its scope of application to the targeted country/ies of exploitation or the country of origin would limit protection. It would not only create further barriers and bottlenecks and negatively affect the recognition of rights, their level of protection and the possibility to ensure remuneration for all creative contributors, but it would also undermine effective enforcement. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A limitation of this kind would likely result in expropriation of national rights. Moreover, applying only the law of the "country of origin" (assuming such a country can be identified and remains stable) would interfere with cross-border enforcement.  It would be more difficult to provide evidence that, say, a pirate site, is using intermediary services to infringe copyright in another country, if the basis right infringed is artificially considered as relevant only in the country of origin . Thus rightsholders, who are already struggling in securing proper enforcement of their rights, could be faced with further difficulties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The relevant history and case law tells us that making available takes place both where content is offered and where it is accessible by the public. This is a reflection of the interactive nature of the right, it is vitally important to licensing and to content protection.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amending the scope of this right, including via one of the suggested routes is likely undermine the value of this right as a licensing and enforcement tool.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In practice, litigation already takes place where the infringing act takes place (country where the act of upload happens and where the content is accessed). This approach has also been confirmed by national courts.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it doesn't. For most music services, users need rights from performers, producers, composers, publishers and these rights are delivered within the context of market based solutions at a level that allows for services to offer tens of millions of sound recordings. Not all of the rights come from one source and nor should they come from one source. But typically the making available and the reproduction rights are licensed together. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In any licensing situation there is typically a whole bundle of rights to deal with and in most circumstances these two rights are licensed together under one agreement for the ease of the end user. Music publishers have worked hard to simplify the process, and rightsholders have been providing licenses to respond to this issue for years now with no difficulties.

Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.   Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to point out in the first place that we don`t believe that a general answer to such a question can be usefully offered.  Providing a link is not a category that in itself can be usefully analysed, without reference to specific facts and circumstances that qualify it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned by the Commission in this consultation document, there are various cases pending before the CJEU. Therefore we believe that it would be premature to come up with a solution without having prior clarification from the Court on this matter.  However, noting this, there are some judgements by national courts that are relevant and useful. In the Netherlands, the District Court of The Hague has ruled that that a website that is embedding or linking to radio streams without a licence infringes copyright. In another case, the Court of Amsterdam decided that publishing hyperlinks to copyrighted content is, under certain circumstances, a copyright infringement. For this publication to be an infringement, there must be an intervention, a new audience and profit (this does not necessarily have to be economic profit; it can be the attraction of new visitors/customers).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, the CJEU has confirmed that linking is always a communication to the public and as such, it requires authorisation from the rightsholders when the linking to content is made available without consent, or made available on a restricted access basis (i.e. to another public). If no authorisation takes place, there is an infringement to copyright. The CJEU states that for there to be an `act of communication', it is sufficient, in particular, that a work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons forming that public may access it, irrespective of whether they avail themselves of that opportunity. Therefore, a potential "new" public is sufficient for there to be a communication to the public. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, since hyperlinking is an essential part of the way the Internet functions, EMI considers that placing of hyperlinks for the purposes of making available protected content to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a new public without the authorisation of the rightsholders should be considered as an infringement to copyright. The nature of the content or service to which the hyperlink is leading is crucial: if it leads to licensed content or to a licensed service, then there is no infringement, provided the hyperlinking is not circumventing the terms on which the content was licensed or the basis on which the licensed service is offering its services to the public. However, if the hyperlink leads to unlicensed content the making available of which has not been authorised by the rightsholder, then there is an infringement. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To conclude, we would like to point out that there are different licensing models for streaming and downloading that work very effectively in practice (For example the PRS-MCPS joint online license or the current range of licences offered by PRS).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.     Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As with question 11 above, we don't believe that this question can be anwered with a straight yes or no answer, unless it is made clear what kind of browsing is being envisaged.  This question gives no definition and no reference as to whether we are looking at end users activities or also at search results/platforms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, and given the pending cases before the CJEU, we believe that it would be premature to come up with a solution without having prior clarification from the Court.  In any event, we further believe that the Copyright Directive already provides the answer to this question. In particular, Article 5.1 of the Directive outlines when the exclusive right of reproduction can be exempted. That is; only temporary acts of reproduction, which are transient or incidental and an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent economic significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From an end user perspective, copies necessary to allow for browsing, i.e. copies on his/her computer may well fall under art 5(1).  However, copies residing on providers' servers are not temporary. In addition, browsing can fall within the remits of Article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive, if the conditions therein are met. In light of this, EMI takes the position that no broadening of this existing copyright exception should be considered and that this exception should remain subject to all its pre-conditions. In particular, we consider that the condition that only temporary acts of reproduction "which have no independent economic significance" is crucial. For example, viewing a website where music is streamed can be considered as browsing. However this act has an "independent economic significance"and should be considered out of the scope of browsing and therefore subject to the rightsholders' authorisation. Browsing is an end user activity and should not be confused with or excuse infringements by websites, search results and other activities that require authorisation.

Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

 NO OPINION
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resale of a previously purchased physical copy of protected content, such as a CD, is not comparable to resale of a digital file online. The rights implicated in online licensing are the making available and the reproduction rights.  These rights are not subject to exhaustion.  Creating an ad hoc exhaustion doctrine for content acquired on line would be a limitation incompatible with the 3 Step Test:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no secure and reliable "forward and delete" technology;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One purchased digital copy could, without any loss of quality, be resold millions of times to the point of turning what would be a secondary market into a primary one.  It would thus conflict with normal exploitation and unreasonably prejudice rightsholders' interests;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such limitation would have consequences beyond the EU borders, which would need to be studied carefully.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Downloading a digital file is not a purchase but a licence to make a digital copy, so cannot be deemed to be `owned' as it would be in the physical world.  Licences for each digital service are different: it is not about ownership of digital content. Enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would be the same thing as unduly limiting the reproduction and the making available rights enshrined in the EU Copyright Directive. It would also open the door to the legalisation of piracy: a digital first sale exception would allow users to create perfect copies of the original work and distribute any number of these copies to others without the creator receiving any compensation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, it would also have the unwanted effect of increasing the price of the first original copy, which would also be unwelcomed by consumers.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most importantly, there is no economic reason to enable the resale of digital content. In the digital world, digital music services such as Spotify already allow consumers to share entire playlists for free. Similarly, businesses have developed to provide libraries with the ability to stream music to their users with prices adjusted to reflect different library budgets. There is therefore no need to introduce measures to change the status quo, where consumers' needs are being addressed by the marketplace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that in the US, where there are ongoing discussions on the revision of copyright (Green Paper, Copyright Policy, Creativity and Innovation in the Digital Economy published by the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force), the Copyright Office has recommended that the first sale doctrine should not be extended to digital transmissions. In addition the recent Court case Capitol Records, the Court has rejected the first sale defence to digital music downloads.
Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been internationally accepted that copyright arises from the simple creation of a work or subject-matter without the necessity of an application or registration. This principle is enshrined in Article 5 (2) of the Berne Convention stating that the enjoyment and the exercise of copyright shall not be subject to any formality. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We consider therefore that there is no reason to change the status quo.  Any registration system would thus have to be voluntary and not become, directly or indirectly, a condition for copyright protection.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imposing a registration system in the EU would be contrary to international law binding the EU and its Member States, create more burdens for rightsholders while not ensuring that there is an effective protection of their rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are voluntary registries already in place. Voluntary "registration" is already taking place one way or the other: rightsholders are in the majority of the cases "registered" to a CMO. In addition, stakeholders have voluntarily identified the need to create a better solution that ensures that CMOs' databases contain only "clean" data and accurate information of rights ownership in order to facilitate efficient cross border licensing and the distribution of royalties to the relevant rightsholders in a consistent manner across Europe. In addition, authors and composers also see their rights "registered" in their music publishers' databases. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, bearing in mind that there are several "registrations" possible in place, the challenge to be addressed now would be getting all these databases to contain clean and up to date data easily displayable to the interested party in a practical way. In this regard, the music industry is already working towards a Global Repertoire Database (GRD) which will provide, for the first time ever, a single, comprehensive and authoritative representation of the global ownership and control of musical works for the benefit of authors and composers, music publishers, CMOs, users and consumers. (See question 19 below for further information).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned above, music rightsholders are already voluntarily registering their rights through CMOs, for them to manage their rights and distribute back to the appropriate rightsholder the royalties due. The incentive is no less than the certainty that when a CMO is working efficiently and in a transparent way, rightsholders are ensured their royalties.  In addition, stakeholders have identified the need to establish a registration system through the mechanism of the GRD to create better solutions than the current CMOs' registrations systems. This is being done on a voluntary basis. The timely and effective implementation of the soon to be adopted CRM Directive will also be of great assistance on this matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, if a registry was deemed to be authoritative (i.e. GRD), it could in some way help with enforcement of music rightsholders' rights.
How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In its Communication "A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights", the Commission stated that interoperable online databases should help identify rightsholders and foster the development of licensing infrastructures. In the same Communication, the Commission announced that it would support measures to make it simpler and efficient to access copyright protected works through innovative licensing technologies, certification of licensing infrastructures, identification and data exchange of actual usage and electronic data management. It committed to encourage and support projects undertaken by various stakeholders to develop automated and integrated standards-based rights management infrastructures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you know, the international music publishing community is committed to, and deeply involved in the ambitious project of a Global Repertoire Database (GRD).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the pressing need for the establishment of the GRD has long been recognised in the music community, one of the key reasons for its development was recently confirmed when data assessment exercises carried out by the various GRD work strands revealed the shockingly poor quality of data with which European CMOs are currently working. We know that the Commission has signalled the importance of an effective means of processing of data, and the above examples highlight the urgency of delivering a first release of the GRD by 2016 as per the current schedule. Data inaccuracies such as these prevent the correct processing and invoicing of uses of musical works.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the formation of the GRD Working Group (WG), music publishers have been cooperating closely with composers, songwriters, CMOs and digital service providers to bring the idea of a single, authoritative database on global ownership and control of musical works to fruition. From September 2011 to March 2012, the GRD WG completed a Stakeholder Engagement and Scoping Study to determine the technical, data, business process and organisational design aspects of the GRD. Since the launch of the Requirements and Design phase in October 2012, representatives of participating stakeholder groups have been hard at
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
work, defining the GRD business requirements, data standards, technology blueprint and business design. Following considerable investment of time and effort, the Requirements and Design phase was completed in May of last year. The project moved into technology build in October 2013, with a first release anticipated in 2016.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a crucial project and there remains an acute need to establish the GRD as soon as technically feasible. A single authoritative database on musical works ownership and control would not only bring immense benefits to the individual players, big and small, in the music industry by reducing costs and administrative burdens, it would also help drive forward the digital economy, both in Europe and internationally. We are aware from our participation in the LfE dialogue that the Commission is interested in developing practical industry-led solutions in the areas of licensing and cross-border portability of online content, and we believe that the GRD is integral to this process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, the Commission should continue to promote the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases, in particular the GRD. First and foremost, political support from the Commission is needed. The unprecedented level of ambition and scale associated with this global project makes it dependent on the reliable support and cooperation of all participating stakeholder organisations. In order to continue making developments in this project, we need to keep pushing ahead with the building of the GRD. EMI realises this and, on behalf of the global music publishing community, we are fully committed to working towards this goal. At this advanced stage of the project, any delay, lack of commitment or inability to compromise among the participating organisations could result in irreparable harm to the GRD's momentum, and endanger its timely implementation. Complete cooperation is required in order for all parties to be able to reap the full benefits of this innovative project. In this respect, the Commission's continued support and active encouragement on this issue would be very much appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It could also be envisaged requesting funding support from the Commission. European programmes like COSME (EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)) and the ICT 2014 - Information and Communications Technologies can be considered in this regard.
Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMI considers the current term of protection (70 p.m.a. for authors and 70 for performers and sound recordings) is still very much appropriate in the digital environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed, as demonstrated in the Commission's impact study, adopted norms on term extension will give average performers additional income ranging from Euro 150 to Euro 2000 per year.  These amounts, mostly attributable to airplay royalties, are insignificant for the big music superstars but they are considerable for many musical performers, session musicians in particular.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Music publishers spend a lot of time and money bringing writers to the market. They provide significant advanced payments to these artists before these artists make any profit. Obviously they are only able to invest if they can get compensated for their rights; developing talent is an expensive business. Creative industries are long term industries that need significant investments to exist and develop. In an increasingly aging society, life plus 70 is an appropriate term of protection. Anything shorter than that has often proven to be too short to recoup on those investments. It has also often proven insufficient to allow creators and their descendants to legitimately benefit from the exploitation of their works. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, the term of protection of 70 p.m.a. for authors is in line with the term of protection in most of EU's main trading partners. Inconsistency in the term of protection would make it difficult to achieve an appropriate level of efficiency in the management and the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on an international scale.  A reduction of the term of protection in the EU would place EU authors at a clear disadvantage vis à vis their main trading partners.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no indication that the different national approaches on some exceptions create difficulties for consumers / users regarding the use of online services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most relevant and important copyright exceptions and limitations have been adopted by the majority of EU Member States. When a Member State has not implemented certain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
exception it is just due to national specificities, and we don't believe that this has a cross border impact that needs to be addressed.

Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, the current EU exceptions and limitations regime enables EU Member States to deal adequately with these issues. EMI does not see any Internal Market need to make the exceptions mandatory or a need for a mandatory harmonisation of such exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rationale behind the EU exceptions and limitations regime is to allow people to use copyrighted works for a specific purpose as long as it complies with the internationally recognised principle of the Three Step Test. This Test only allows exemptions in cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightsholder. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In light of this, SM believes that the way exceptions and limitations are defined in the EU Copyright Directive already provides a good balance between rightsholders' and users' needs. These exceptions and limitations have also shown to be sufficiently flexible to meet the demands of the move from the analogue to digital world. Extending the scope of existing exceptions is not the way forward to provide effective and quicker access to those that require it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, when considering the need to add or remove exceptions and limitations from the existing list, a distinction should be made between what is in the public interest and what is free riding. In our view, an extension of the scope of the current exceptions is undesired. Calls from certain stakeholders for a re-opening of the Directive and a re-examination of its list of exceptions often hide the intention to weaken the copyright framework so that they can develop new commercial services for free at the cost of the creative and economical efforts of rightsholders. It should not be forgotten that with technological developments, piracy has increased significantly. Therefore any exceptions and limitations must take account the further increased risks that rightsholders face, particularly in the absence of adequate collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who often hide behind existing limitations of liability and data protection rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, any changes envisaged should be made taking due consideration of the following factors: assessment of the impact of each exception on the Internal Market; that the proposed policy is supported by robust economic evidence; and that the potential changes are compatible with international copyright law and the Three Step Test. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in earlier responses, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive was drafted taking into account the different needs and traditions in EU Member States. A list of mostly optional exceptions allows for an adequate degree of flexibility for Member States to adopt or adapt their regime to local culture and traditions.  The focus should be a good application of these exceptions by EU Member States.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As explained above, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive was drafted taking into account the different needs and traditions in EU Member States. While it is true that the way that different EU Member States have implemented these exceptions into their national law varies in some cases, this is to address specific national needs. This territoriality of the exceptions and limitations does not, in our view, distort or create significant discrepancies in the Internal Market that need to be addressed.  We don't see how copyright, which is territorial, could be subject to cross border exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EU Copyright Directive only mandates the application of a fair compensation principle to the private copying exception and leaves the matter at the discretion of EU Member States for the other exceptions. In addition, some EU Member States also apply the fair compensation principle to the educational exception. In our view, the status quo should continue to prevail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at a national level were to have a cross border effect, the obligation of fair compensation should take place where the harm is done, by the person whose acts caused the harm in that country, in accordance with the CJEU Padawan decision. The making available right also enters into play. Furthermore,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recognising cross border effect on national exceptions would inevitably multiply the number of applicable exceptions and impose national traditions on other countries.  This is completely at odds with a list of mostly optional exceptions currently applicable. If a country has not implemented private copying, for example, or has not provided for a system of compensation, the cross border effect of the exception could deprive rightsholders of their rights or of the remuneration due. 
* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are not aware of any problems. Should specific problems arise, these can be solved via negotiated solutions between rightsholders and users, such as licensing (either directly negotiated by rightsholders or via CMOs). In our view, negotiations between rightsholders and users are more flexible and achieved more quickly than legislation, and would therefore be in our view the preferred option. In any case, if any problems arise, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive would provide a solution to the problem.

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We don't think that there are any problems. Should specific problems arise, these can be solved by negotiated solutions between rightsholders and users, such as licensing (either directly negotiated by rightsholders or via CMOs). In our view, negotiations between rightsholders and users are more flexible and quicker achieved than legislation, and therefore the preferred option.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, in our view, granting any form of exception or mandatory scheme (as opposed to voluntary licensing arrangements) to enable e-lending by libraries whether it is cross border or national  would create a direct competitor for subscription services which are a growing sector of service providers.  This would be extremely harmful because it would destroy an existing and growing online market.  In Finland, for example, only creators are remunerated for the lending of physical products. The e-lending right would leave all publishers and record labels, the real investors, outside the right to get remunerated. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MOU on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works signed in 2011 was intended to facilitate agreements in the print sector between parties such as authors, publishers and libraries, on collective licensing schemes for the digitisation and making available by public institutions "out of commerce" printed works (books and journals) first published in the Member State where the agreement is intended to be signed. As the Commission recognises in the FAQ, this agreement is very specific and sector driven and cannot simply be extended to other types or forms of protected content. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our view is that there is no case for a similar arrangement regarding music as digitisation is a common feature and the chances of music being both in analogue form and out of commerce are remote.

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

First of all, and as recognised by the Commission in this consultation paper, it must be emphasised that no consensus was reached among participants of the WG2 in LfE on either the problems to be addressed or on the definition of user generated content (UGC). No examples of any concrete real world problems experienced by users that were caused by copyright were put forward.   In this context it seems that there is a risk of seeking to solve a problem that has not even been identified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned by rightsholders in LfE WG2 discussions, we have not experienced significant problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works to create derivative works within a licensed environment. UGC is not a new and unaddressed market. UGCs as either original or derivative works, or both, can be accommodated by existing mechanisms in place to deal with derivative works (i.e. licensing solutions).  Rightsholders have been developing, and continue doing so, licensing solutions for the so-called UGC and for small scale licensing. The way licences are being offered and the scope of these licences makes it easy for users to create and share UGC based on a wide range of musical works. In LfE specific licensing initiatives relating to UGC and offered by publishers and CMOs were clearly described. In addition, music publishers in particular are engaging in discussions with collective management organisations and authors and composers to develop guidelines that facilitate and standardise small-scale licensing. Music publishers are also engaging in discussions with users on this matter. For example, YouTube in the EU is licensed by a number of CMOs and European music publishers. In addition, members of NMPA (National Music Publishers Association in the US) and YouTube recently entered into an agreement covering synchronisation rights on behalf of songwriters, as well as versions of their songs.  Unfortunately, we can't provide any more examples because our active negotiations are subject to NDAs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, we do not believe that UGC raises any new specific issues and even if it did, we think that the current EU's Copyright Acquis is well-equipped to address them. The current framework already provides for the necessary conditions to foster and to promote UGC. In the past few years, many interactive Internet websites dedicated to allow users to express their creativity by using protected works have flourished within the current legal framework. This proves that the current legal framework works and allows for UGC to develop. The fact that no examples could be produced of cases being brought against users in respect of UGC was particularly informative of the scale of the so-perceived "problem".

In any case, marketplace agreements like the YouTube mentioned above [or the DailyMotion website] show that it is possible to ensure that creators receive fair compensation for the use of a work created out of an existing work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in question 58 above, we do not see any problem emanating from UGC as a matter of principle. UGC is not a new concept as such and licensing solutions are already available to meet any challenges that it poses.  These solutions can ensure flexibility and scale
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for users, commercially attractive services for service providers and compensation for rightsholders and creators. Nevertheless it remains the case, as with a significant volume of use of music online, that certain activities do not take place within a licensed environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UGCs are derivative works and there are mechanisms in place to deal with them (i.e. simple licensing solutions available on major platforms/ or by way of a commercial agreement). In our view, the authors of all "derivative works", including UGC, must obtain a license to use the pre-existing material. Songwriters and those who invest in their work (music publishers) have a longstanding expectation that derivative works can be monetised.  There is a viable commercial marketplace in existence for the licensing of these works, and there is no compelling reason to grant an exception for UGC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such an exception would cut across the rightsholder's ability to license and generate revenues.  There is danger that we are facing an exception positioned in terms of "UGC" when really we are talking about clear synch licensing opportunities which can and should be managed within the licensing framework. Any changes to the law that would allow users to make derivative works from musical compositions without a license would have a significant and negative impact on songwriters and music publishers because songwriters and music publishers make the vast majority of their living from licensing derivative works.  In addition having an exception on UGC would pose difficulties when ensuring that the moral right is maintained. Music publishers play a vital role in defending the rights of creators, including moral right. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are aware of the calls from some sectors urging the EU to introduce a new exception for UGC based, for example, on the US "fair use" principle.  This would simply not work in the EU. The differences between the civil law tradition that exist in the majority of the EU Member States and the common law approach in the US are too big to overcome. Further, European copyright principles rightly recognise the moral right of authors and creators, rights which are clearly implicated when works which are derivative of an existing work are created.  It is important that solutions for UGC not only offer rightsholders the prospect of participation in the commercial value created by UGC but also that authors are offered the means by which their moral right can be asserted and objections to the use of their works made if necessary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, the US "fair use" doctrine is based on litigation and decades of case law. The EU could not just insert the "fair use" principle from one day to the next on top of existing exceptions as the consequent legal uncertainty would be tremendous. The EU has an efficient copyright framework based on specific exceptions and limitations, which together with the Three-Step Test provide for the necessary flexibility while ensuring sufficient legal certainty. For example, one form of UGC is already addressed in the EU Copyright Directive via Article 5.3(d), (i), (k) that exempts uses quotations, incidental use, and for the purposes of caricature, parody or pastiche. We therefore take the view that existing exceptions already provide for the necessary conditions to foster UGC and that there is no (practical or economic) evidence to the contrary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have to assume that the questions relating to UGC are focussing on those who put together or create the content.  It is in fact worth noting that the consideration of any kind of exception relating to end users activities on this matter cannot be seen as a way of releasing relevant ISPs from their potential liability. As mentioned earlier, there are increasingly more websites dedicated to the facilitation, publishing and monetisation of UGC. The activities of these websites go beyond merely "hosting" and therefore they are unlikely to benefit from Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive to avoid liability. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To conclude, the main problem that we -as rightsholders- experience from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet is proliferation of unlicensed activity and piracy. 	The reality is that despite the fact that there are licensing solutions to deal with UGC, the reality is that in many cases users of UGC and the services offering UGC chose not to go for these offers and prefer the "get it for free option". Therefore any measure on UGC would need to be accompanied by effective measures on IPR enforcement. Educational measures should also be envisaged. Time needs to be devoted to educating consumers on the legal uses of content and on the importance of the respect of copyright for the creative industries and for a culturally rich world in general. 

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We consider that there is no need for further clarification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Copyright Directive is sufficiently clear regarding the scope of the exceptions and the flexibility given by the EU framework has allowed Member States to implement it without jeopardising the national legal and cultural traditions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, for private copying Article 5(2) (b) of the Copyright Directive , the corresponding recitals 35, 38, 39 and 52, the recitals dealing with exceptions and limitations in general (recitals 44, 45 and 52) as well as those on technical protection measures (recitals 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and 53). Moreover, Article 6 paragraph 4, subparagraph 4 is crystal-clear on the interrelation between private copying and DRMs in case of interactive delivery of copyrighted content on agreed contractual terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 5(5), Copyright directive enshrined the three steps test in its internationally recognised in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works as well as other international and European instruments. This principle constitutes an additional set of conditions whose recurrence is required for any of the exceptions to occur and has been used by the CJEU as a key interpretative element as per the speciality of the exceptions and limitations, the guarantee of the normal exploitation of the works and the respect of the legitimate interest of the rightsholder. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The uniform interpretation of the private copying and reprography exceptions is being provided by the CJEU. Recent cases such as Padawan, Stichting de Thuiskopie v. Opus, Austro-Mechana and VG Wort, among others, provide the clarification needed on the scope of the application of private copying. In addition, cases still pending before the CJEU will provide further interpretative guidance , notably as regards the notion of fair compensation in regards to mobile memory cards or fair compensation for reproductions made using different sources such as files where the use is approved by the rightsholders and paid for by the customer; files where the use in question is approved by the rightsholders and not paid for by the customer (for example marketing purposes); the user's own DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer, etc; where effective technological measures are not applied, the user's own DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer, etc; where effective technological measures are applied; third party's DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer etc; unlawfully copied works from the Internet or other sources and files copied lawfully in some other way from, for example, the Internet (from lawful sources where no licence has been granted, etc. The High Level Mediator Mr Vitorino also examined and praised the role of the CJEU in his Recommendations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the above mentioned cases, the Court has confirmed that in those countries where consumers are allowed by law to make private copies of copyright protected content, rightsholders have a right to be fairly compensated for these reproductions. Private copying levies have been introduced in the majority of the EU Member States as a way to guarantee this fair compensation. In Padawan, the Court confirms that the act of copying copyright protected content by consumers must be considered as an act which is likely to cause harm to the rightsholder, and consequently justifies the application of a levy. The Court made clear that levies should be calculated according to the assumed harm sustained by rightsholders by the private copying in question. In Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus, the Court addressed the obligation of a country that has introduced the private copying exception to provide fair
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compensation and stressed that the "harm" suffered by the rightsholders arises on the territory where the final private users reside. In the Austro-Mechana Case, the Court gives guidance on practical implementation of levies both nationally and in cross-border trade.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An important step in the interpretation of the scope of the private copying exception will be the awaited verdict in case C-435/12 ACI Adam and Others. The Advocate General (AG) Cruz Villalon has already outlined the issue of the legality of the source and confirmed that the private copying exception only applies to reproductions made from legitimate sources.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally, yes. However, it depends on the circumstances. If there is no private copying under the exception, levies do not apply either; if the exception occurs, levies generally apply and vary according to various factors. According to the EU Copyright Directive, if a license fee has already been paid for the use of a service, then no additional private copying levy is due.  In our view, this criterion should not be deemed applicable when there are two separate uses only one of which is licensed.  For example, if a consumer has purchased a TV licence, making copies of programs is not included in such a licence, it is a separate use stemming from a separate right from which private copying exceptions may arise.  We believe that double payment for double use is not double payment and should not be considered as being the instance provided for in this criterion in the Directive.

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reasoning behind levies is to compensate rightsholders for the harm that is likely to arise for private copying practices relating to musical works. Nowadays levies are hardly "compensating" rightsholders.  The levy payment is due on devices and equipment and not in relation to specific works being copied as it would be impossible to control the amount of copying being carried out. This is why for publishers licensing the reproduction of a work is always the preferred option whenever possible, practicable and enforceable. Licensing is also the best way to keep up-to-date with new online services and ensure that rightsholders are remunerated fairly. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As new online services develop the possibilities for licensing increase. However, this does not in any way mean that levies should be eradicated. In relation to cloud computing, for example, there is a difference between the licensing position of the cloud service, and the devices via which such cloud service is accessed. While cloud services should be subject to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
licensing and not to a levy, the devices can be levied without prejudice to the licensing position of the cloud service. Consumers now have more recording devices and equipment than ever before and therefore justification for levies subsists. Levies should continue to exist to cover the consumer's private copy with a focus on the private nature of the copy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the digital world, private copies are "perfect clones" of the original. Concerning the control of private copying, it seems appropriate to distinguish between copying from an online digital source (website) to an online digital medium (cloud storage facility) or copying from an offline digital source (CD) to an offline digital medium (MP3 player). Whereas the latter act of copying is difficult to manage and would therefore fall under the private copying exception subject to equitable compensation, the former can easily be controlled and licensed. In our view, there is no justification for a model of exception if the activities are licensable and licensed. Consequently, any new exception should not cover online digital services (be it as a source or as a medium of the private copying).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that it would be helpful to display the levy on each invoice in the sales chain, including on the consumer's invoice. Transparency is essential to ensure that the appropriate levy rate is applied, that no double payment takes place in case of export, that no avoidance of payment occur and that auditing is aided. However, transparency on the levy paid by the consumer should not create the illusion that the final user has acquired a right to copy using the purchased device or equipment, in all circumstances.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.  

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CJEU has also looked into this question in several cases. The CJEU considers that, as per cross-borders transactions, the payment of the levies should be done at the Member State where the end-user resides (Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus point 41). Making the end-users directly liable for the payment of the levy with the distributor/manufacturer jointly and severally liable will reduce the risks of double payment. The compensation could be included in the price of the device/media and paid only once at the time of purchase by the user. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Padawan decision (and confirmed by subsequent judgements) the CJEU made clear that the harm to rightsholders is caused by the end-user copying for his/her private use a protected work (Padawan point 45 and Stichting de Thuiskopie point 26 and Amazon paragraph 23). Nevertheless, and due to practical difficulties in identifying private users, this does not preclude the possibility of national systems to impose the payment of the levy on the persons making available to the end-user reproduction equipment or devices, since they are able to pass on to private users the actual burden of financing the fair compensation (Padawan point 50 and Stichting de Thuiskopie point 29). The Amazon case (paragraph 37) recognizes the legality of existing systems which indiscriminately apply levies on the first placing on the market in national territory for commercial purposes of recording media suitable for reproduction while at the same time, provides for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set in Article 5(2).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we accept that double payment may arise in cross border transactions, nonetheless, most EU Member States have refund systems in place to deal with this problem. Refunds for exports are usually set by legislation or private agreements between CMOs and the exporters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, the best way to avoid double payment in cross border sales is that the country where the obligation of payment of the levy should arise and therefore the private copying rate is applicable should continue to be the country where the sale takes place. In case of distance sales, the country should be the one where the end user resides. In cases where the manufacturer, importer, distributor and retailer continue to pay the levy (and then revert it on to the end user), existing refund systems should be guaranteed to avoid double payment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Stichting de Thuiskopie and Amazon cases, the CJEU recalls that Article 5(2)(b) imposes on Member States which have introduced the private copying exception into its national law an obligation to achieve a certain result, namely for the fair compensation to be effectively paid to rightsholders residing in its territory. In cases of distant selling, the Court established that this obligation to compensate the rightsholder cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has been paid in another Member State (paragraph 66). A person who has previously paid that levy in a Member State which does not have territorial competence may request its repayment in accordance with its national law (paragraph 65).

If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although there are indeed disparities in the methods of calculating levy tariffs as well as disparities in equipment and media, the situation is well managed and under control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that the EU should not move in the direction of the various systems that are being adopted at national level and that have nothing to do with the EU exception envisaged in the EU Copyright Directive. We are referring in particular to the initiatives in the UK and Spain where the systems being introduced seem incompatible with EU Law as they fail to provide for an appropriate system of fair remuneration for creators and rightsholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another example that we don't want to be mirrored at EU level is Germany, where the system was changed some years ago. While previously the rate was set by the Department of Justice (and therefore remained rather low over the years) it is now supposed to be negotiated between rightsholders and users. In practice, this does not work as there is no incentive for users to come to a quick understanding. As a result, rightsholders do not see any money for years. As mentioned above, this system is something that we don't want to have at EU level. 
Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view the best way to ensure that authors and composers are fairly remunerated for their work is to have (i) the freedom to grant their rights to their choice of representative (whether that is a CMO or a music publisher or any third party) in an environment that is pro competitive; effective copyright protection; and (ii) effective IPR enforcement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important to note that with new technology come new licensing models.  Some of these are developed by existing market players that adapt their approach to the market to meet new needs and some are developed by new players that innovate and create new business and/or licensing models.  In the context of music it is clear that whilst the more traditional music industry has evolved new licensing solutions and structures, new entrants have evolved different approaches including buy-out libraries and other licensing options.   It is not possible to legislate for a particular remuneration mechanism without running the risk of rendering disruptive and/or innovative solutions impossible.  By way of example, an unwaivable right to remuneration that is subject to a compulsory collective licensing regime would eliminate the scope for free licensing options. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as the freedom to grant their rights, a very effective way of protecting authors and composers in securing fair remuneration is the enormous choice of music publishers that there is in the EU.  For example in Europe, there are approximatelly 3,400 separate music publishing companies. These authors can therefore choose with which publisher to engage. The market self regulates through choice and (often very fierce) competition.

Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is crucial that there is a high quality civil enforcement system of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in the EU. Efficiency and effectiveness of civil proceedings in cases concerning infringements of IPRs is poor. We fear that if copyright reform proceeds along the lines suggested in this consultation paper, copyright infringement will either increase or be legalised.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to our members, litigation in cases concerning the infringement of IPRs is both costly and long and there is the additional difficulty of identifying and establishing the territorial liability of the infringer.  We believe that in many cases, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are an effective solution.  Whether they are sufficiently accessible to the parties affected by the infringement depends however on the different national systems. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also don't think that it should be more important to stop infringements that are committed with commercial purpose (for profit) than infringements committed not for profit. What matters is the damage suffered by rightsholders.  We believe that it would be very dangerous to draw the line between what is considered for profit and what is considered not for profit. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first place a clear definition should be provided, and the concept of potential damage to the rightsholder should be taken into account. Due to the fact that the damage and financial gains from piracy can be very substantial and also difficult to ascertain, pre-established or multiple damages could be an alternative solution to any lost profit that in many cases would be almost impossible to prove. In this respect, a predetermined calculation method should set a figure which is sufficiently high to compensate the rightsholder for the likely damage and to act as a deterrent. Furthermore, differentiating between for profit and not for profit infringement ignores the market impact criterion. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another area that needs attention is civil court proceeding. The intention when instigating civil law court proceedings concerning infringements of IPRs is to stop the infringing activity, dissuade the infringing behaviour, take measures to prevent further infringements and to be compensated for the infringements. It could be useful to establish at EU level model rules for fast track proceedings for civil law cases concerning IPR infringements, if the rules were to be based on those procedures and practices carried out in the UK and Germany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In relation to the remedies for copyright infringement, and more specifically concerning damages and injunctions, we consider that the 2004 Enforcement Directive, as currently implemented by different EU Member States varies tremendously leading to lack of clarity in some. We are particularly concerned about Article 11 on injunctions and Article 13 on damages, where there is great inconsistency among Member States. The following are examples of inconsistency:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Injunctions: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As has been noted by the report of the Legal Sub-Group of the European Counterfeiting and Anti-Piracy Observatory, the conditions imposed by national law or by jurisprudence for
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
injunctions with respect to intermediaries vary widely from one Member State to another. In some Member States Article 8(3) has either not been implemented effectively or not been implemented at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some Member States it is not possible to issue injunctions unless the liability of an intermediary is established, contrary to Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, as well as to Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive, which do not link injunctions with the liability of an intermediary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some Member States, national courts hold that rightsholders should seek their remedy by taking infringement proceedings against the primary infringers. This prevents rightsholders from obtaining relief due to the high costs that pursuing all individual infringers supposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some Member States, injunctions against intermediaries are ineffective as they only instruct the intermediary from allowing the exact same infringement to happen (in practice it is quite possible that the same infringer may engage in future infringements of the same or different titles or products owned by the rightsholder).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rightsholders experience significant delays in obtaining injunctions against intermediaries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some Member States injunctions aimed at preventing infringement of copyright are only available on a title-specific basis that have been adduced in evidence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damages: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We agree with the Commission that "at present, damages awarded in IPR cases remain comparatively low" and "do not currently appear to effectively dissuade potential infringers from engaging in illegal activities". Indeed, unless the Directive includes measures to enable rightsholders to recover the full extent of their loss, including attorney's fees, expert costs and all costs incurred in establishing that an infringement had been committed, including court fees and fees payable to ISPs for providing the personal data of the infringer, the inability to recuperate such costs would often discourage rightsholders from pursuing legal action, particularly small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which make up the vast majority of music publishers and our members.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It needs to be noted that due to the fact that the level of damages is relatively low, parties often prefer to settle disputes out of court.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to have an adequate compensatory and deterrent effect, damages awards should be such that they put the rightsholder in the position he or she would have been in had the infringement not taken place; and that they serve to discourage both repeat and would-be infringers. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inconsistencies and differences in implementation and interpretation of the Directive across Member States make damages claims uncertain and costly.  In some Member States, the basis on which damages are calculated depends on proving the number of copies made; in others, the calculation is made on a royalty basis; in others, the rightsholder has to prove the actual damage suffered. Currently, national courts face significant difficulties in calculating and awarding compensation due to the confusion in interpreting the legal framework and the problems with the evidence requirements that rightsholders must meet to substantiate damages claims. The result is that in many cases rightsholders are only compensated under the lost profits standard which is almost impossible to calculate in the on-line world. It is for this reason that courts in other nations are given the flexibility to calculate damages in other ways such as damages prescribed by statute. Guidelines for the calculation of damages would be particularly useful in copyright cases. The implementation of a statutory damages regime is required to make civil enforcement viable. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some Member States, damages are only available where infringements are committed on a commercial scale.  In others, no compensation is awarded where the infringer has no knowledge of the infringement and is only awarded for intentional or negligent infringements. We believe that there ought to be common standards of "actual knowledge" and "awareness" as clarification is needed to prevent further obstacles being placed between the rightsholders and the enforcement of their rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, to render the civil enforcement system more efficient in the EU, we would ask for a cross border/pan-European injunction system; recognition of national judgements across borders; and liability only applies to completely neutral hosting services (that is, a revision of the 2000 E-commerce Directive); that an injunction against a specific service obtained in one Member State can be enforced in another Member State, either directly or by way of an expedited procedure. In addition, it is also key that rightsholders have access to necessary data from the ISPs so they can virtually identify the infringer and enforce their rights.

In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely not. The current framework is not at all clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries. It is difficult however to answer to this question without touching upon the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by the E-commerce Directive, which, as the Commission has expressed in footnote 77, will remain unchanged. This is in our view a lost opportunity as there is clear problem with the safe harbour provisions present in the E-commerce Directive. These provisions have worked as a disincentive instead of as an incentive for ISPs to cooperate. There has been not such voluntary cooperation between ISPs and content providers because the former have often raised their fear that by cooperating they would lose their intermediary status and the exemption for liability dependent on that status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the anachronisms in the wording of the safe harbour provisions in the E-commerce Directive have an impact on the Enforcement Directive which was framed around physical format piracy and built on legislation such as the E-commerce Directive. Online piracy not only appears in the traditional hosting environment but also through P2P, cyber-lockers, etc. In addition, many infringing websites hide behind Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive claiming that they are only hosting content to avoid liability. The incentives put in place by the EU Enforcement Directive are insufficient and need clarification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cooperation with ISPs is crucial in this regard.  ISPs are the gatekeepers of the Internet. The vast majority of these ISPs are large companies and businesses, while rightsholders tend to be SMEs and individuals (publishers, authors, composes, etc.). It is therefore unrealistic to suppose SMEs and individuals could possibly have the resources to deal with all unlicensed uses of their copyrighted content across all providers. As stated in the Commission Communication on E-commerce, the mechanisms to stop abuses and illegal information (i.e. illegal content) should take into account rules of proportionality. It is only common sense that large businesses, particularly those dependant on content for survival, should be more vigilant and take greater responsibilities for the illegal content on their services than SMEs, simply
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
because they are better "equipped" than SMEs and composers to prevent illegal activities on their sites, due to their size and turnover and because they have created a business based on other people's rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is through the efforts of ISPs and other intermediaries, working with rightsholders, that effective solutions can be found. Notice and action procedures may be useful for hosting services but not for other forms of online infringement.  Steps that can be taken are, for example, sending education messages to subscribers whose accounts have been identified as infringing,  and warn them that refusal to stop the infringement can lead to meaningful consequences, filtering, site-blocking, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The measures above have been accepted by policy makers in different EU Member States. Voluntary agreements between rightsholders and ISPs are also starting to develop. However, voluntary agreements are not the only solution as not all ISPs are willing to cooperate, and rightsholders don't have the means to enter into negotiations with every single ISP. As a consequence, the most effective way to fight theft is by legislating. The EU needs effective rules that impose clear obligations for ISPs and other intermediaries to cooperate in the IPR enforcement. This should be supported by sanctions for non-compliance.

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This question of the consultation leaves the impression that the right balance with the right for private life and data protection in particular is at risk due to the current enforcement rules. This is however inaccurate because the balance is indeed ensured by the Enforcement Directive itself and safeguarded by the CJEU. The Directive stipulates in Recital 32 that "it respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union". However, rightsholders are encountering inconsistencies in the way in which different EU Member States are interpreting the relationship between the right of information and data protection, with a number of countries interpreting legislation in such a way as to give preference to data protection over the right of information, and hence making difficult the enforcement of their rights. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is true despite the ruling in the Promusicae Case in which it was stated that EU Law requires a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order which include the fundamental rights to property and to an effective remedy and the rights protecting personal data and private life. The ruling held that the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with the Directives but must also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, when considering the right to property and to an effective remedy, EU Member States should take into account that rightsholders may find it difficult to prove infringement without the information that they are seeking under the right of information. We believe that EU Member States should not impose a requirement that infringement should be proved as a pre-condition for granting an order for disclosure. The words "without prejudice" in Article 8(3) of the EU Enforcement Directive do not mean that legislation protecting the rights to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
protection of personal data should take precedence over the right of information. Instead, and in accordance with the Promusicae ruling, national courts should have regard to such rights when deciding whether or not to grant an order pursuant to the right of information. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, in order to ensure that rightsholders are not prevented from gathering evidence of online copyright infringement, we call for confirmation that gathering and processing IP addresses for the purposes of collecting evidence of infringement is not contrary to EU Law (i.e. EU Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data) and that any national laws that provide that it is must be rectified.

A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the subject of a possible establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, we agree with the Commission's assessment of the Green Paper on the online distribution of AV works in the EU that the "feasibility, actual demand for, and the tangible advantages of, such a title, together with the consequences of its application alongside existing territorial protection must be thoroughly examined". The idea of creating a new European Copyright law that would replace existing national laws should also be thoroughly examined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our view, it is unclear how such EU Copyright Title would work; whether it would be a voluntary or a mandatory title. Should it be the former, we do not think that it would be adopted. National laws are already in place and this Title would just duplicate the laws that already exist at national level adding an extra layer of complexity. If on the other hand, this Title is conceived to be mandatory, we would be talking about full harmonisation of copyright throughout the EU. The EU Copyright Framework was conceived taking into account national cultural and social differences. Fully harmonising the EU copyright laws would entail Member States losing the ability to implement their own cultural values through copyright. In addition, a single EU Title in the field of trademarks and patents make sense as it avoids long procedures in terms of obtaining rights in different countries. This incentive does not exist for copyright which arises from the single creation of a work. Furthermore, pan-European licences are already being granted without an EU Title.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, we believe that a single EU Title is unachievable and unworkable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In relation to a single framework for enforcement, we do believe indeed believe that further harmonisation is needed. (Please see our answer to Section IV)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to our comments above, we do not believe that this should necessarily be the way forward. Indeed, the Commission has been considering this idea for quite some time now (in its 2010 Reflection Paper, "Creative Content in a European Digital Single Market: Challenges for the Future", the Commission raised the question of adopting a "European Copyright Law"). The fact that this idea has not been take up is a proof that this supposes a huge task to undertake without the certainty that it would bring any real advantage.
Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed in the future.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned throughout this document, the following issues should be addressed: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Measures aimed at counteracting illegal access to copyright protected works, including enforcement and cooperation with intermediaries should be effectively implemented in those EU Member States where they are still missing (i.e. Article 8.3 of the EU Copyright Directive and the related Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, and Articles 12 to 15 of the E-Commerce Directive). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Educational measures should also be envisaged. Time needs to be devoted to educating consumers on the legal uses of content and on the importance of the respect of copyright for the creative industries and for a culturally rich world in general. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discrepancies in fiscal policy among Member States, particularly in the field of VAT, should be addressed. The introduction of a reduced VAT for the delivery of online cultural products would provide a major consumer boost for the development of the Digital Single Market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Commission should continue to promote the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases, in particular the GRD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Concerning enforcement of IPRs, it is crucial that there is a high quality civil enforcement system of IPRs in the EU.
