   I.     Introduction
PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:


Name: Universal Music Group, recorded music division.

Introductory Comments by the Universal Music Group
We would like to make some general remarks on the Consultation and the process around it.

The recorded music industry has embraced the digital world, more than any other industry,
and music is a key driver of digital growth – most digital services want music as their first
content play. Music used to be, and still is against all the odds, a European success story and
Universal Music is a European company.

Historically some had said that it was the music industry’s fault that there was a piracy
problem because we had not licensed widely enough and that the cure for piracy was to
licence more. Leaving aside whether, even if it was true historically that we had not licensed
enough, that was an appropriate conclusion, today 37 million (and growing) tracks are now
available across the European Union on a large variety of services at various price points
including free. Music is now available legitimately to everyone, everywhere, at any time.
But there is still a huge piracy problem and the industry in Europe is less than half the size it
was when it peaked in 2000. Licensing is clearly not the issue.

The Copyright Review started because of calls to amend copyright law. There were
suggestions that it was “not fit for the digital age”. Laws need to be changed if there is a
failure in the market. There is only one failure here and that is the failure of EU legislation to
enable the creative industries to effectively tackle piracy and the damage it causes to the EU
economy.

Universal Music has no problem with a review - we welcome the debate and we have been
heavily involved in the Licences for Europe discussions on our own and through our industry
association. The basic principle behind the Copyright Review should be that if there is a
problem it should be fixed but the problem needs to be properly identified and evidence
supported. However the process, insofar as it concerned the music business, has so far come
up with nothing that suggests that anything needs fixing, except enforcement. No one has
been able to substantiate any other problems.

We are puzzled though by the seeming haste to complete a Copyright Review, especially
considering the significant impact this could have on key European industries. The rush to
complete the review in the last year of this Commission means that inadequate time has been
taken for proper consultation with the creative industries and in particular does not give the
Commission the necessary time to take fully into account theirs, and others, views. The way
the review has been structured means that many very different creative sectors have been
reviewed with the same broad brush approach, and clearly any conclusions need to
acknowledge the respective differences between the sectors.


                                                                                                    2
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

We are also disappointed by the extent of the Review including questions on whether term of
protection should have been extended when it is only just being implemented in European
Union member states, and whether artist agreements are fair. In respect of artist agreements,
and with reference to our response to Q.72, we have submitted separately a confidential note
evidencing not only that royalty rates in the UK (as a sample country) have steadily and
significantly increased over the last few years but also that digital rates are materially higher
than physical rates. Furthermore we feel that the subjective and negative tone of some of the
questions is not helpful. These all seem to suggest an attempt to reduce the protection that a
major European industry enjoys when no evidence has been produced to suggest that anything
needs changing.

Music is a significant contributor to the European economy, a major employer of EU citizens
and a key driver of cultural diversity. On an economic and cultural basis you would
objectively expect the EU to be looking for ways in which it can support the industry.
However enforcement only merits two questions (of 80) at the end of the document. With
the decline of a major European industry due in significant part to piracy we are hopeful that
the EU will grasp the opportunity of this process to improve enforcement and support its
cultural industries.

We hope you will find our responses helpful.

    II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
    NO
    NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).


The business of the Universal Music Group (UMG) is the creation and distribution of music.
Making UMG repertoire available across the EU is an essential part of UMG’s strategy. This
means UMG is constantly working with its partners, the service providers, to enable them to
distribute music throughout the EU. It is key to the business of UMG to provide access to
music for EU consumers using business models that meet customer demand and to facilitate
the service providers in providing these models.
With 267 digital services in the EU the consumer has an unprecedented choice of services and
ways in which they can access music. 37 million tracks are being made available and this is
growing by the day. The market has delivered a European success story. UMG will continue
to work with new and existing service providers to grow and innovate the European digital
music industry.
In respect of portability music services do provide portability across borders for consumers
when travelling or residing abroad. For internet radio long established market led schemes set
up by the record companies and the IFPI provide cross-border licensing and consumer access.
Furthermore the main music services have made virtually all international and local repertoire

available in every EU country with more music being added all the time. As a participant in
the Licenses For Europe consultation working group on territoriality at no point was it
substantiated that a territoriality problem existed for music, including any unsatisfied
consumer demand, that required a legislative solution.
The introduction raises the question as to what can be done at EU level to assist the
development of online content services and the key problem in the EU for service providers,
record companies, performers and authors is piracy which inhibits the growth of existing
online services and provides a deterrent to the establishment of new services.
  NO OPINION
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
UMG is asked for, and grants, on a frequent basis multi-territorial and EU wide licenses. As a
content business UMG pro-actively licenses and encourages services to operate in as many
EU territories as possible (and indeed globally). More services in more countries is a key
driver for the EU music industry.
However it should be noted that although a service provider may have been granted a license
at launch for multiple territories for business reasons it is rare that a service provider will
decide to launch simultaneously in all territories for which it has a license.
There are a number of reasons for staggered roll outs (or in the cases of some service
providers the desire to only target a limited number of countries) that do not relate to the
licensing of the content. For example: A successful launch needs country specific editorial
and marketing which reflects the cultural diversity of the EU. Free to consumer ad supported
services have adverts which, as a result of the language and products, are targeted to each
country. Services also want to test and adapt business models in one or two countries before
implementing them on a wider scale. Smaller service providers do not necessarily have the
resources to successfully launch simultaneously in multiple countries and a poorly managed
launch can cause irreparable harm for a service. Even companies with the huge resources of
Apple and Google have implemented a staggered roll out.
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
It is clearly in the interests of UMG to license the rights it controls. It would make no business
sense to limit certain content to certain countries even though UMG has the necessary rights.
Also it should be noted that record companies do not always control all the rights for a


                                                                                                7

particular artist or catalogue of repertoire across the whole of the EU, this is more often the
case with indie record companies.
  NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples



7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
Music is not a market in need of legislative intervention on cross-border availability, in fact
the status of the market itself demonstrates that legislation is not necessary. 267 services have
launched across the EU under the current legal framework. Five major services, iTunes,
Deezer, 7Digital Youtube and Myspace are available everywhere in Europe. Spotify is in 25
countries, Xbox music in 28, Rara in 20, eMusic in 25 and Googleplay in 15. In addition we
expect these services to continue to expand across Europe.
As part of the Licenses For Europe consultation in respect of music no evidence was provided
to demonstrate firstly that any change was in fact needed and secondly that any such change
would be of benefit to the market or consumers. Furthermore the consultation did not
conclude that any such change was needed. As referenced in the response to Question 3 above
there could be negative consequences for service providers if they were forced to launch on a
pan-EU basis.
The national territorial nature of copyright is enshrined in member state law for good reason
and it has not inhibited the establishment of the music industry as one of the most advanced
and innovative digital content sectors in the EU and indeed the world.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
See response to Q.9
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
     NO OPINION
9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no demonstrable need for a clarification. The territorial scope of the making available
right has not caused any practical problems for UMG. In respect of the licensing of service
providers the current status of the territorial scope of the making available right has not
impacted the ability of UMG to grant multi-territorial licenses.
Content owners need the ability, as they have now, to enforce in the location of the infringing
party and in all countries where infringements take place. A country of “target” concept
would limit the ability for enforcement and not take account of the fact that the content is
being made available from a specific country and, typically, globally distributed. Effective
enforcement requires an ability to tackle the source of the problem as well as the target.
We would point out that no grounds have been given in the introduction as to why a
clarification in the law would be of benefit or indeed which parties would benefit, and how,
from such a clarification. Also no indication has been given as to the form and detail of any
such clarification.
At a time where the EU music market needs greater rights, not less, for the industry to protect
intellectual property any legislative changes on the making available right could negatively
impact the ability of rights-holders to enforce their rights against pirate services.


     NO
     NO OPINION

15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")


UMG licenses the reproduction and making available rights simultaneously to service
providers so the existence of two rights has no practical impact for UMG or its licensees. The
existence of two rights has been managed effectively by the market.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Hyperlinks to protected works should, in certain circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rights-holder. This was confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case (C-466/12) which
also held that authorisation for linking does not apply to links to copies that have been made
available without the permission of the rights-holder.
The Svensson decision is in line with other cases. For example in the UK Newzbin case
(Twentieth Century Fox v Newzbin ([2010] EWHC 608) where the court found grounds to

block the unlicensed index site “Newzbin”, from which the operators where making available
films to the public by the aggregation of links to infringing content. This case was followed in
Paramount Home Entertainment International Ltd v BSB Ltd [2013] EWHC 3479 (Ch).
In another example, in Germany, the Hamburg High Court ruled against pirate locker service
Rapidshare, (Hamburg High Court, 14 March 2012, No. 5 U 87/09) and found that the making
available of the works occurred when a link to the work was published.
Pirate services, such as those using Bittorrent, are structured to provide aggregated links to
users in order to provide access to infringing content. While pirate locker services rely on
links being placed to the infringing content on their servers. Bittorrent and pirate locker
services are the two biggest sources of infringing content in the EU. It is critical that the law
enables rights-holders to effectively tackle these methods of piracy.
Svensson and the other supporting cases show that a broad definition of the communication to
the public right should be maintained. Otherwise right holders will be deprived of remedies
against these forms of piracy.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
The position under EU law on this matter is already clearly set out in the EC Copyright
Directive (5.1). The Directive provides that where there is a temporary act of reproduction
which is transient or incidental, is an integral and essential part of a technological process and
whose sole purpose is to enable (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an
intermediary or (b) a lawful use then no authorisation is required provided they have no
independent economic significance.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.         Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution


19
     See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                12
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
The question is not applicable to music, restrictions exist as the act is prohibited.
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The consequences of allowing resale of previously purchased digital content would be
devastating to the music industry. It would compete directly with the sale of original digital
files as they would be entirely substitutional.
Applying the same concept to digital content as is applied to physical content completely
ignores the many and material differences between the two forms.
In practical terms a digital file resold will always be a copy of the original. It would be
impossible to prove that the original copy of the digital file had been permanently deleted by a
seller from all their storage devices. Any digital copy would be identical in quality and they
could be copied and sold multiple times.
With physical copies effort was involved in acquiring and distributing the copy while digital
copies could be sold with one click. Obviously, unlike physical copies, digital copies would
have no deterioration in quality.
In addition the re-sale of digital copies could also potentially damage the business of those,
typically SME, businesses that re-sell physical content.
We refer you to the analysis in this area by the U.S. Copyright Office which concluded in its
Report (Section 104 Report at pp. 82-83):
“Physical copies of works degrade with time and use, making used copies less desirable than
new ones. Digital information does not degrade, and can be reproduced perfectly on a
recipient’s computer. The ‘used’ copy is just as desirable as (in fact, is indistinguishable
from) a new copy of the same work. Time, space, effort and cost no longer act as barriers to

20
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

the movement of copies, since digital copies can be transmitted nearly instantaneously
anywhere in the world with minimal effort and negligible cost. The need to transport physical
copies of works, which acts as a natural brake on the effect of resale on the copyright owner’s
market, no longer exists in the realm of digital transmissions. The ability of such ‘used’
copies to compete for market share with new copies is thus far greater in the digital world.”



C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
The use of registration (and any resulting identifiers) is an area in which market led solutions
develop, on a global level and case by case basis, where a business need arises. A legislatively
imposed system carries significant risks for the market including additional administrative
burdens, added infrastructure and IT costs and potential conflict with existing market
provided solutions. No issues have been identified and evidenced that cannot be met by
market led solutions.

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
In respect of identifiers we refer to the response in Q.15
In respect of databases as with identifiers where a business need is established then market led
solutions are followed. There is not a need for legislative intervention. However the historic
and ongoing support of the EU for market provided solutions continues to be welcomed by
the industry.



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
The current term of 70 years in the EU for performers and producers was only implemented at
the end of last year. Bearing this in mind we do not understand the rationale for this question
which appears contrary to the democratic process that implemented the new legislation and
the considerable debate that concluded an extension from 50 years to 70 years was entirely
appropriate across the EU. Indeed the international norm is moving to 70 years with 50 years
no longer seen as an acceptable period as demonstrated by the EU extension itself.
The new law has provided performers with the opportunity to benefit from their creations
fully during their lifetime. Further they will benefit from additional remuneration during the
extended period. The extended period also provides revenue to the industry which can be re-
invested in new artists, allow longer term investment decisions, reward risk taking with young
talent and through this enable cultural diversity.
Compared to other creators of intellectual property even with the new term extension the
recorded music industry is, without basis, at a disadvantage. For example authors (both music
and books) and film-makers have the protection of life plus 70 years.
We would also point out that the term extension did not apply to recordings from 1962 and
earlier so those recordings continue to remain in the public domain.
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
     NO OPINION

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
     NO – Please explain
In practice to the extent there are variations between member states they have no or negligible
impact. This is due in part to the fact that key exceptions have been implemented across the
EU and very few have cross-border impact.
     NO OPINION
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
31
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           17
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


  NO – Please explain
Firstly as set out in the response to Q.21 the optional nature has not had a negative impact on
implementation so there is no demonstrable requirement for mandatory implementation or
harmonisation.
Secondly if a mandatory proposal were to be made it would have to be considered on a case
by case basis for new exceptions (the existing exceptions not requiring mandatory
implementation as previously stated) and clearly justified that an optional implementation
would not work.
Thirdly any exception derogates from rights and so is a very significant step which would
have to be subject to rigorous evidence (including the actual rather than perceived quantity of
users effected) that such an exception was absolutely necessary together with an economic
assessment of the impact of such exception on the parties involved (which could in many
cases be very significant).
Fourthly no exception can be justified where market solutions are or can be provided for the
matter raised.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
No. There has not been any failure demonstrated in the market that would justify new
limitations or exceptions. As stated in the response to Q.22 rigorous evidence and justification
would be needed for any new exception and there is no current matter which meets that
threshold. During the Licenses For Europe consultation no matter was presented which
would stand up to objective scrutiny as a rationale for a potential exception.

Furthermore exceptions are made redundant where market led efforts produce practical
solutions. The market can provide fast and targeted solutions while adapting constantly to a
changing environment something that is significantly harder for legislation. An example of
this is the use of sound recordings in UGC where the licensing of platforms gives users free
easy access to a global audience while providing revenue for rights-holders and the platforms,
this is clearly a win win situation for all concerned. See also our response to Q.58 (UGC).

We would also draw attention to the background music on websites scheme established by the
record industry as part of the Licenses For Europe consultation process. This was a scheme
set up in a matter of months which is an illustration of how responsive the market can be.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
  NO – Please explain why
As shown in practice there is already sufficient flexibility which allows the Member States to
implement exceptions in a practical and targeted manner. Greater flexibility would give
greater potential for conflict and inconsistency between Member States. Furthermore with


                                                                                             18
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

greater latitude comes a higher risk that the rationale and intent of the underlying legislation
be changed with significant adverse consequences.
For example in Q.25, where the questions leads comments to a fair use concept (although this
is an unfamiliar concept for most Member States), this is exactly the sort of proposal which
would fail the three step test, the key protection for rights-holders. Also with reference to the
response in Q.22 it has not been demonstrated that any such exception is necessary in the EU.
Indeed such a concept would cause significant adverse harm to the music industry.
     NO OPINION
25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
UMG is not aware of any such practical problems nor has anyone identified such problems as
far as we are aware.
     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
For each country in which the exception has an impact and where compensation is payable
then (a) the entity benefitting in that country from the exception should pay and (b) the entity
which holds the rights in the specific country should be compensated

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

We consider that no further exceptions are required. Exceptions are only required if there is a
failure in the market and none has been identified. If there are any problems which are
demonstrated to exist at some point in the future then they should be addressed by market led
solutions and licensing not legislation.

The music industry already has a vested interest in preserving and making available
repertoire. This is an area in which UMG has focussed significant resources

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
In respect of music the range and availability in the EU, including in particular on demand
free to use services, means there is clearly no issues in respect of access.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
We do not believe there are any such problems in respect of the music industry, they have not
been established and therefore no solution is required.

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
     NO
The variety of services and music, including free to access on demand services, means that e-
lending for music is entirely unnecessary. Whereas e-lending would cause significant adverse
harm to the music industry essentially becoming substitutional for, and in direct competition
with, licensed services. In addition music lent electronically could be copied and retained
permanently. Lent copies unlike physical product would be perfect copies. Furthermore each
library has a limited number of physical copies which creates an inherent limit on the amount
of users at any one time point in time, this would not be the case with e-lending.

activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

See our response to Q.36


4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
     NO – Please explain
The availability and accessibility of music in the EU makes mass digitisation by institutions
unnecessary and a waste of tax payer resource. UMG already digitises its’ repertoire.
     NO OPINION
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
     NO
     NO OPINION
43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The existing exception is fit for purpose and does not require amendment as illustrated by the
Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information Society Directive which firstly stated that the
exception for teaching and research (art. 5.3(a)) is formulated openly, i.e. e-learning is
included in the scope of the exception and secondly that the best option to address and solve
any divergences would be to require Member States to meet the aims of the exception,
especially when it concerns cross-border teaching and research (pp. 402 – 403 of the Study).
The ubiquitous availability of music in the EU means that this is not in practice relevant for
the music industry.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders

45
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

The music industry has provided to EU consumers through licensing of platforms
unprecedented freedom to access and adapt copyrighted works, in conjunction with other
materials, in the form of UGC. At no cost UGC content can be uploaded by consumers onto
licensed platforms and made available on a cross-border global basis. The market has
responded and met consumer demand. The licenses are granted to the platforms themselves
which means that consumers do not need to be concerned with obtaining licenses as they are
automatically licensed via the platform. At the same time UGC generates revenue for the
platforms and rights-holders from advertising placement. This revenue has become very
significant, in particular from video streaming, for the platforms and the music industry.
Platforms also provide the ability for users to simply and easily embed UGC content on their
own blogs and websites so that the content appears to be coming from their own site. This
makes the need to post UGC directly by a user on their own blogs and websites unnecessary
and indeed no substantive demand for such direct posting has been evidenced. Furthermore
there is no evidence that there is an unmet need in respect of UGC that is causing problems
for consumers.
The involvement of the platforms is also important where music is used in connection with
offensive material with which the artist does not want to be associated. In such rare
circumstances the arrangement with the platform enables removal of the offending material
which is crucial for protecting artists and rights-holders. For example in the case of UMG an
artist requested the removal of one of their tracks which was being used as a soundtrack to a
propaganda video by a far right political party with whom the artist did not want to be
associated. This does not stop that party distributing the propaganda video, it just prevents the
use of that particular recording with the video.
As an active participant in the Licenses For Europe consultation working group on UGC at no
point was it substantiated that a UGC problem existed that required a legislative exception.
Indeed to the contrary it was clearly evidenced that licensing was meeting the needs of
consumers. In this context we also refer you to our responses to Q22, 23 and 24.

In respect of music the introduction is incorrect in its reference to freedom of expression as
being relevant. The ability to use copyrighted music as part of UGC is not relevant to freedom
of expression. Freedom of expression is not conditional on, and nor does it need, the use of
copyrighted music. The music industry has a long and proud history of supporting freedom of
expression, and will continue to do so, but that has nothing to do with UGC.

in this context?

  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
Digital identification systems such as those provided by Audible Magic and Youtube (Content
ID system) are generally satisfactory for identifying the use of pre-existing works in UGC
although the industry is constantly working with its partners in order to improve those
systems. These systems are also central to identifying the revenue that is due in respect of

Legitimate services seek, and UMG is keen to grant, licenses. Obviously pirate services do
not remunerate anyone.
61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The market has led the way with licensing UGC and to the extent any problems are identified
this provides a fast and flexible way to address any practical issues that may arise. At the
same time this ensures that rights-holders are remunerated for the use of their content. It is
clearly key that the law enables rights-holders to require licenses from platforms exploiting
UGC content.
62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

                                                                                           30
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


[Open question]
It has not been evidenced that there is a problem or that a legislative solution is justified.
Clearly a very high threshold for evidence and justification must be reached for an exception
to be even considered. The existing legal framework has led to a market led licensing
situation for UGC which meets the needs of consumers.
Any legislative action would be materially damaging to the music industry as the creation of
an exception would deprive the industry of significant revenue. In practice consumers would
see no difference as they would continue to use the services in the same manner as before.
The benefit of an exception would sit solely with those platforms who license UGC (and
indeed pirate services who did not previously obtain a license) as they would then be able to
exploit pre-existing works without compensating the rights-owners on a commercial arms-
length basis as is the current situation.
In addition it would leave rights-holders unable to enable the swift removal of offensive
material and for artists to have protection of their moral rights.
To conclude we refer you to the Study On The Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on
Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society prepared for the Commission which
stated:

(a) there are not “sufficient problems in practice to justify” a UGC specific exception (p. 542
of the Study); and

(b) legislation to introduce more flexibility into the list of exceptions “will practically give
rise to more questions than it will answer and will lead to increased litigation”, lead to
“unexpected but undesired results,” and that it “is likely that it would have an adverse impact
on the functioning of the Internal Market” (p. 541 of the Study).

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

As explained above licensing has met consumer needs and will continue to do so in the future.



     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
47
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                             31

computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions50 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
Directive 2001/29/EC already provides clear exceptions for copyright and reprography that do
not require further clarification. For example the private copying exception clearly states that
the exception is limited to individual, non-commercial uses, in return for fair compensation.
We are not aware of problems resulting from national legislation or case-law relating to the
actual scope of the exception, except for the issue of legal source, which will be clarified by
the CJEU in the near future.

     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?51
          – Please explain
The music industry’s priority in the digital space is to grant licenses. However there are cases
where rights holders cannot license reproduction and Directive 2001/29 provides clear criteria
for the payment of fair compensation in those circumstances. Possible harm to right holders is
only one factor to be considered when harm is evaluated. Importantly the concept of harm
includes missed licensing opportunities where copies cannot be licensed. The Directive
already states (Recital 35) that no levies are due when the prejudice to the right holders would
be minimal. As a result no further clarification of this issue is necessary.

devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
In respect of the music industry levies have no impact on the development of new digital
services including those which utilise cloud based technology. Changes in levies could
negatively impact rights-holders and online services. Levies are for the fair compensation of
rights-holders and should not impact the market.
As a user and licensor of cloud services UMG recognises the importance of cloud technology
which is used by an increasing number of digital music services (for example iTunes Match,
Amazon MP3 and GooglePlay). UMG supports and licenses these types of service.
The greatest impact the EU could have on new business models is to address piracy which is
the key inhibiting factor for EU start up companies.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?52
     YES – Please explain
A clear transparent explanation would be useful where it states the reason for the levy and
clearly identifies those responsible for payment.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.


68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
     NO – Please explain

transactions of products which are subject to levies (and these systems could equally be
applied to online sales if necessary).
The Opus judgment of the CJEU (case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus Supplies,
16 June 2011) made it clear that in cases of distance sales from one EU Member State to
another, where a private copying exception and levies exist, then the distance seller is liable
for the payment of the levy applicable in the Member State where the consumer is located. It
is for the Member State where right holders are due payment of private copying levies to
ensure the effective recovery of the levy, irrespective of the location of the seller.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question] We do not have the data in order to provide this figure for music product in
the EU. Whether it is an individual or a company is however irrelevant as the key point is the
type of use not the status of the user. Also Member States already provide systems of
exemptions and reimbursement for certain categories of users to prevent undue payments.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
The CJEU has clearly established that levies are an adequate and legitimate method for
implementing compensation for rights-holders. However we would make the following two
points. Firstly the levies as currently implemented are not sufficient to compensate for the
actual harm being caused. Secondly levy distributions in some EU countries are unfairly split
amongst rights-holders, such differentials are not justifiable. In both cases this should be
addressed at a national level.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.



54
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The remuneration of authors, performers and other rights-holder has been devastated by the
impact of piracy. Sales of music have halved as a direct consequence. In order to substantially
increase revenue for performers and authors the EU needs to provide adequate legislation to
enable producers and publishers, on behalf of performers and authors, to fully tackle the
piracy which has caused, and continues to cause, so much damage to the industry.

The market functions entirely satisfactorily as between performers and producers. Existing
contractual practices and the contractual freedom of all parties involved are, and continue to
be, the best mechanism for addressing remuneration of performers. What route performers
take to market and the agreements performers make in the process are entirely at the
discretion of those performers. The decline in revenue over the last few years does not come
from the contractual relationship between producer and performer but from the impact of
piracy.

UMG does not agree that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated. In fact
royalty rates are now typically higher than in the past while for digital exploitation the
royalties are as high, if not higher, than those for physical sales. UMG will submit separately
a confidential note evidencing this change in royalty rates in the UK, as a sample country,
over the last few years.

The digital market has not offset the decline in physical sales caused by piracy so there is not
additional revenue in the value chain. The growth of digital as a new form of distribution does
not give rise to grounds for arguing for a change in the economic relationship.

The grant of exclusive rights, and the period of the grant, to producers is essential to enable
them to take the often significant financial investment risks they make in an industry where
there is never a guarantee of success. In return for the exclusive rights granted by performers
(and not forgetting that record companies pay up front artist advances and recording costs) the
record companies then develop and market the artists. Furthermore this gives them the ability
to enforce those rights against infringing parties.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
       – Please explain why
See the response to Q.72. There is no demonstrable need for action at an EU level.

                                                                                             35
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


Legislative interference with complex heavily negotiated contractual arrangements and
ecosystems could have a severe negative impact and would be entirely unjustified.
The significant competition within the industry and the development of digital distribution
means that authors and performers have more contractual freedom and opportunity than ever
before to choose their route to market. From signing with majors, independents or self-
distributing the range of options and ease of market access means that companies have to be
competitive on all contractual terms. If record companies aren’t competitive then performers
will simply not sign to those companies.
As an example of the unprecedented number of routes to market now available to musicians
(with and without record companies) UMG itself set up Spinnup (www.spinnup.com). This
service provides, for a small one off fee, digital distribution to major music platforms
including Spotify and iTunes. Musicians using Spinnup retain all rights in their music and get
100% of the royalties generated.
In addition there is a demonstrably low barrier for establishing new record companies which
is demonstrated by the expanding indie sector, this further enhances the competitive market
for performers.

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain
The Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) is ten years old and with the huge development of
the internet and piracy it is no longer sufficient to deal with the problems faced by rights-
holders and in particular where piracy is carried out cross-border and often operated from
outside of the EU. The EU has a huge piracy problem so clearly the current enforcement
system is not providing rights-holders with all the necessary tools to tackle piracy which is to
the detriment of the EU economy. The Enforcement Directive needs to be revised and updated
to reflect the challenges of piracy that have arisen over the last decade and protect the EU
economy and its’ creative talent in particular from Bittorrent and pirate locker services. In
respect of the reference to “commercial purpose” we would also point out that there are also
piracy services which operate on a non-commercial basis (ie: do not generate revenue from
advertising or payment providers) but cause the same damage to content owners.
The impact of insufficient legislation has meant that piracy is significantly damaging the EU
in a number of ways in particular piracy:
(a) damages the EU economy and is responsible for significant job losses. We refer you to
Tera Consultancy’s March 2010 study “Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of
Saving Jobs in the EU’s Creative Industries” (“Tera Study”), which found that in 2008, the
EU’s creative industries that were most impacted by piracy (film, TV series, recorded music
and software) experienced retail revenue losses of €10 billion and losses of more than 185,000
jobs due to piracy.
(b) reduces sales, revenue and therefore taxes paid by legitimate business. As an example we
refer you to the Smith/Telang study “Assessing the Academic Literature Regarding the
Impact of Media Piracy on Sales” (2012).
(c) Between 2000 and 2012 global music sales have fallen by 40% predominately due to
piracy.
(d) restricts the revenues available for investment in new artists and the resulting development
of cultural diversity.
(e) reduces revenue to authors and performers.
(f) inhibits the start-up of new EU businesses in the music sector.
(g) Limits the potential growth of existing businesses (including EU based services such as
Spotify, Deezer and WIMP). When launching in iTunes the late Steve Jobs stated that
iTunes’s biggest competitor was piracy not other legal services.


Non-Intermediary Legislative Enforcement Changes
Legislative changes are clearly needed. Set out below are the legislative changes needed that
do not relate to intermediaries. Set out in the response to Q.76 are the legislative changes
needed in respect of intermediaries.

(i) Article 8(3): EU wide implementation.
Article 8(3) (Directive 2001/29/EC) has not yet been properly implemented in all Member
States and this process needs to be completed as a matter of EU law and to protect rights-
holders.
                                                                                             37
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


(ii) Article 8(3): Cross-border injunctions.
Pirate services operate globally and typically have links to a number of countries either via
hosting providers, server locations or operator locations. This has resulted in rights-holders
having to take multiple actions within multiple EU territories (for example in the case of The
Pirate Bay). Clearly within the EU there should be the ability to have injunctions from one
Member State enforced in another directly or by expedited procedure.
(iii) Article 8(3): Expedited Procedure.
Injunctions can take significant time and cost to obtain and implement during which the
infringements continue to cause significant damage. As a result expedited procedures should
be available.
(iii) Article 8(3): Improvement of effectiveness.
Pirate sites often uses technical measures to circumvent Court sanctioned injunctions (for
example by changing IP/DNS addresses). For example this is something that The Pirate Bay
has done on a regular basis. The relief should also apply catalogue wide to all current and
future repertoire such that once the original infringements have been established it is not
necessary for rights-holders to continually bring actions against the same pirate site for
continued infringing acts.
In addition where injunctions are granted EU ISPs, on an EU wide basis, should be required
to terminate any hosting accounts for the injuncted pirate service.
(iv) Damages.
The level of damages needs to be increased to a significant level in order to achieve their
original intent of sufficiently detering infringing operators and compensating rights-holders
for the damage caused to them.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The current legal framework is not clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries who are central in assisting with the inhibition of digital infringements. Pirate
services use a range of intermediaries to deliver and support pirate content in the EU such as
search engines, advertising networks, payment providers, hosting companies, ISPs and
domain registrars. These intermediaries will often benefit financially through their interaction
with the pirate services and therefore from the underlying infringements. EU businesses
should not be providing support to pirate services. As such the areas below need to be
addressed.
Intermediary Legislative Enforcement Changes
(a) Enhanced co-operation from intermediaries




                                                                                             38
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response


The intermediaries referenced above need to provide assistance in tackling piracy. In
particular key steps include the following:
(i) search engines should stop directing consumers to infringing content or services while
prioritising legal services.
(ii) advertising networks/advertisers should not serve adverts to infringing sites, which
provides them with revenue;
(iii) payment providers should not provide financial services to pirate sites; and
(iv) App stores should remove Apps which are designed to facilitate piracy. For example
some Apps are designed solely to rip audio from streamed music videos (the videos being
streamed by legitimate licensed services).


(b) Protection only for truly neutral intermediaries.
The ECJ has established that protection against liability should only be granted to “merely
technical, automatic and passive” services, in other words true neutral intermediaries. Truly
neutral intermediaries merit protection however many pirate services that do not fit this
criteria, such as pirate locker services, attempt to benefit from the safe harbour protection.
They are designed at a structural level to infringe copyright, it is their business model. They
rely on their ability to continually re-post infringing content faster and in greater volumes than
can be notified by rights-holders.


(c) Updating of public databases by ISPs and identification of pirate service operators
In order to take effective enforcement action under EU law rights-holders need the ability to
correctly identify the infringing party operating the pirate service. Most pirate services
deliberately provide fake details or hide behind shell companies based outside of the EU.
They will also typically move from one ISP to another quickly and as such ISPs need to have
an obligation to keep accurate and up to date the public databases (such as Domain Tools and
RIPE).

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
Existing legislation and case law (for example the CJEU Promusicae case) already deals
extensively with the appropriate balance.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly

                                                                                               39
Universal Music Group – EU Copyright Public Consultation Response

Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
We see no benefits in such a title concept and note that none are set out in the introduction. In
fact we only see a negative result in that this would result in increased costs and
administration to the industry with no discernible benefit. Copyright already arises on the
creation of a work and a title system would be an additional burden for creators.
We do not believe an optional title system would be adopted by governments or the industry.
In respect of a mandatory system and full harmonisation of EU copyright we do not believe
that is necessary or practicable. The territorial nature of copyright means that such a proposal
would be unworkable. No grounds are given as to why such a concept would benefit the
copyright industry or any other parties. Furthermore Directive 2001/29 already contains the
necessary degree of harmonisation.


  NO OPINION
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]

No, this should not be the next step in EU copyright development. The pressing issue that
needs to be addressed is piracy enforcement.
