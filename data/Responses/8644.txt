TYPE OF RESPONDENT (Please underline the appropriate):


  € Author/Performer OR Representative of authors/performers


  € Publisher/Producer/Broadcaster                 OR            Representative            of

  € Other (Please explain):
  The BREIN foundation is a body for the collective enforcement of copyright and
  neighbouring rights of authors, performers, publishers, producers and distributors of music,
  film, TV series, (e)books, games and interactive software. BREIN represents 17 collective
  management organisations and 8 branch organisations that together represent over 1000
  companies and several 10s of 1000s authors and performers.

VI. Respect for rights

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

 Yes. As BREIN has noted in previous submissions civil enforcement against sites that
systematically facilitate infringement could be improved. Based on its extensive experience
with civil enforcement online, BREIN is certain that any decriminalisation of so-called non-
commercial infringements will be abused by such structurally infringing (or infringement
facilitating) sites.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright



                                                                                            1
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

 Yes – In principle Article 8(3) is an effective tool to achieve cooperation from
intermediaries against copyright infringement, by allowing rights holder to hold them to a
standard of responsibility without liability.

Nevertheless BREIN notes that a Dutch appeal court recently denied blocking of the well-
known illegal website The Pirate Bay by access providers. The court ruled such blocking to
be ineffective because it assumed the blocking of this one site did not decrease overall
infringements by ISP subscribers. The court conceded that the local traffic to The Pirate Bay
had decreased significantly and also conceded that research concluded that 25% of
downloaders of illegal content stopped or diminished such downloading (from any illegal
source) as a result of the blocking of The Pirate Bay, but still it assumed that overall
infringements from any source had not decreased as the overall network traffic had not
diminished. BREIN will be appealing to the Supreme Court.

BREIN also notes that ISP cooperation is often frustrated by the fact that intermediaries do
not log client data or log inaccurate client data. Anonymous businesses prevent the legal
system from working. Intermediaries like domain name providers, hosting providers, payment
providers, and online ad-brokers should be subject to “know your customer” (KYC)
obligations (see Article 5 E-Commerce Directive) and the money laundering Directivesi.
Right holders should have the legal means to locate commercial scale infringers. The CJEU
confirmed in the L’Oreal v. eBay case that infringers operating in the course of trade must be
identifiable.ii The EU existing “know your customer” (KYC) legislation applies to banks,
lawyers, real estate agents, casinos and it should also be made applicable to internet
intermediaries.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?

 Yes. The European Court of Justice has clarified in several recent verdictsiii that national
courts have to apply the proportionality test, i.e. that they have to weigh all fundamental rights
in order to arrive at a balanced outcome. In doing so courts take into account the rights and
interests of the parties and stakeholders.

Dutch case law demonstrates that national courts in the Netherlands in general are effectively
applying the required balancing of fundamental rights. With respect to duties of websites the
CJEU, in cases like L’Oreal and Netlog, provided a comprehensive framework for the
balancing of the aforementioned fundamental rights and clarifying the obligation of diligent
commercial operators.
