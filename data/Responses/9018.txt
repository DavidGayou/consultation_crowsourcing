                        Contribution of Fleurus-Mame
                         To the Public Consultation
                   on the review of the EU copyright rules


My name is David Gabillet and  I  work  for  Fleurus-Mame  as  a  publishing
director. Fleurus-Mame is a French  publishing  house.  Copyright  therefore
represents the cornerstone of our activity and of our return on  investment.
We directly employ  23  people  and  our  annual  turnover  amounted  to  20
millions € in 2012. We are a member of  the  French  Publishers  Association
(SNE) whose position on this initiative we fully support.


The publishing industry is contributing  in  a  significant  manner  to  the
European economy. It is the most prominent cultural industry in  Europe  and
in the world. Our  industry  has  contributed  billions  of  Euros  to  both
national economies and EU's overal GDP, with a  turnover  of  €22.8  billion
for 2010 (40 billion € in market  terms).  In  2012,  the  turnover  of  the
French publishing industry amounted to 2.8 billion €, i.e. 4.5 billion €  in
market  terms,  16%  of  which  were  generated  by  exports.  The  European
publishing industry approximately directly employs 130,000 people full  time
(including 10,000 in France for the publishing industry and 70,000  for  the
whole book chain). The  activity,  the  jobs  and  the  investments  of  the
publishing sector directly depend on  copyright  and  on  a  balanced  legal
framework.

More generally, with 1.2 million jobs spread  all  over  France,  and  a  74
billion  €  contribution  to  the  French  economy,  cultural  and  creative
industries play an  active  role  in  handling  the  growth  and  employment
challenges facing France and Europe[1].

Publishers are developing a legal  and  diversified  offer  of  high-quality
digital content and therefore contribute to  freedom  of  expression,  which
they could not be doing without the current copyright  regime.  During  this
period of adaptation of business models and of economic crisis, it would  be
very risky in economic terms to put this sector in a situation  of  an  even
greater uncertainty by changing the rules in the middle of the game.

This is why publishers would like to call on the European Commission  to  be
extremely cautious towards a possible reopening of Copyright acquis  and  to
take into account its consequences on the European  economy,  in  particular
on the cultural industries, such as the book sector and  more  generally  on
cultural diversity.

In particular, there is no real need  to  reopen  the  Copyright  directive.
Publishers actively participated  in  the  initiative  Licences  for  Europe
launched by the European Commission and proposed practical solutions to  the
issues raised by users. Any decision concerning the reopening  of  the  2001
Copyright Directive should  take  into  account  these  results,  which  are
satisfying as far as the book industry  is  concerned,  especially  for  the
working group on cross-border access and portability of digital content,  in
which the French Publishers Association participated more particularly.

Part II of the consultation:  Rights  and  the  functioning  of  the  Single
Market: questions 1 to 5:
Indeed the book model already allows a cross-border  distribution  of  books
and, along the development of the digital market, of e-books.

Publishers are calling on the European Commission to take into  account  the
specificities of the book sector, whether  in  terms  of  the  existence  of
linguistic barriers, of the development of  the  digital  market,  which  is
still nascent in most sectors,  despite  relevant  experimentations,  or  in
terms of the - obviously marginal - role of collective management.

Publishers  welcome  the  new  digital  environment  and  are   continuously
investing in order to build new offers  of  ebooks  and  enhance  access  to
books. Where strong business models exist, i.e. for  the  BtoB  ebooks,  the
market has rapidly rosen, whereas the BtoC market is still experimental.

At national level, French publishers are  continuing  their  work  with  the
various user categories, so as to identify solutions adapted  to  their  own
needs  (digitization  of  out-of-commerce  works,  proposal   on   statutory
collective  management  of  the  educational  exception,  cooperation   with
visually impaired people, dialogue with libraries on e-lending).  They  also
reached an agreement with authors in order  to  adapt  the  author/publisher
contract to the digital environment. Such  voluntary  negotiations  are  the
best way to progress in a flexible and  concrete  manner  and  it  would  be
counter-productive to disturb this work.

Part III of the consultation:  Limitations  and  exceptions  in  the  Single
Market: questions 21 to 27:
Regarding copyright exceptions, it is of utmost importance  to  respect  the
Three  Step  Test  of  the  Berne  Convention,  also  enshrined   in   other
international  conventions  and  treaties.  The  use  of  exceptions  should
therefore be limited to situations of market failure to respond  to  certain
needs of the society or in case digital files cannot  be  provided  via  the
distribution channels or a system  of  licenses  via  collective  management
organization. Since exceptions destroy the market, they should  be  excluded
whenever a commercial offer exists.

Part III.A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Questions 32 to 35:
As far as uses by libraries are concerned, publishers in particular  in  the
academic field (ex. Cairn.info in the Social  and  Humanities  sector)  have
developed  business  models  allowing  under  licenses  for   students   and
researchers to access remotely for research, including across borders  in  a
technically  closed  network.  These  can  allow  many  uses  (“copying  and
pasting”, printing, downloading, forwarding to a colleague,  etc.)  and  can
be adapted more easily by contract than via an exception.

Questions 28 to 31:
Besides,  a  distinction  should  be  drawn  between  the  prerogatives  and
therefore the exceptions benefitting to legal deposit libraries, which  have
an official mission of preservation of  cultural  heritage,  and  to  public
libraries.

Question 35:
Any library exception allowing making available  online  would  only  create
unfair competition with business models, and be contrary to the  Three  Step
Test. Moreover, this would go against the current trend of libraries,  whose
role is less to accumulate content but rather to help  and  train  users  in
their search for information.

Questions 36 to 39:
Regarding e-lending, the e-book market is  only  nascent  for  most  sectors
(less than 3% of the book market) and sales to libraries  only  represent  a
minority of the book market in  general  (around  4  à  6%).  Therefore  the
imposition of an  e-lending  right  would  conflict  too  dramatically  with
business models currently being developed by  publishers  (including  rental
of comics via Izneo for instance) and unreasonably prejudice the  legitimate
interests of the  right-holders.  The  example  of  Denmark,  where  a  very
permissive lending system called eReolen was launched, shows that whereas e-
lending rose  exponentially,  the  nascent  market  of  e-books  came  to  a
complete standstill at during the lending period.

The French Ministry of  Culture  is  currently  hosting  discussions  on  e-
lending with all stakeholders. The study it had outsourced to IDATE in  2013
demonstrated that France was  not  lagging  behind  in  terms  of  e-lending
offers[2].  Publishers  should   therefore   be   encouraged   to   continue
experimenting e-lending models, which licenses allow in  an  efficient  way,
such        as:        Cairn.info        (www.cairn.info),        Immatériel
(http://librairie.immateriel.fr/), IZNEO  (http://www.izneo.com/),  Numilog:
http://www.numilog.com/, Prêt Numérique  en  Bibliothèque  (https://dilicom-
prod.centprod.com/documents/307-PNB_Presentation_V0201.pdf).

Part III.B. Teaching and C. Research
Questions 42 to 49:
Regarding educational uses,  textbook  and  academic  publishers  are  quite
proactive  in  offering  their  books  in  paper  and  digital  formats   to
educational  establishments  and  universities.  In  France,  all   textbook
publishers have been proposing most of  their  works  in  both  digital  and
printed formats since 2008: more than 2,000 digital textbooks are  available
through a huge array of  licences.  They  developed  digital  platforms  and
portals (Canal Numérique des Savoirs and Kiosque Numérique  de  l’Éducation,
accessible via a single portal, WizWiz), which allow teachers  (or  parents)
to consult, order, download and use these resources in the classroom  or  in
any digital learning environment (or elsewhere).

However such offers of school and academic e-books  often  meet  a  lack  of
budget and/or  teachers’  training  in  using  these  resources.  In  higher
education, the level of total document acquisition expenditures per  student
in 2008 was: 45€ in  France,  140€  in  the  UK;  the  level  of  electronic
document expenditures per student  was:  13€  in  France,  27€  in  the  UK.
Moreover, since  2007,  the  expenses  related  to  acquisitions  for  post-
graduate/ research level have been increasingly cutting back those  for  the
acquisition of  high  quality  paper  or  digital  books  in  French.  As  a
principle,  public  budget  problems  should  not  be  solved  by  extending
copyright exceptions .

In France, the exception for illustration for teaching  is  actually  served
through  a  licence  negotiated  by   the   French   collective   management
organization, Centre Français de la Copie (CFC), which covers  the  scanning
and making available of extracts of books (including textbooks and  academic
books,  as  well  foreign  books[3],  in  particular  from  the  Scientific,
Technical and Medical Sector) by teachers on secure  school  and  university
intranets, against remuneration for right-holders.  Such  content  could  de
facto be accessed by students located abroad  but  such  cross-border  needs
have never been reported so far.

The solution is to encourage such licenses and  to  protect  the  market  by
maintaining the following obligations:
    - The exception for the benefit of teaching is limited to small parts,
    - any copies made remain in the hands of the teacher and pupils and  are
      not passed on,
    - rightsholders are named and receive fair remuneration,
    - school books and academic books are excluded from such  an  exception,
      as educational uses represent their main or even sole market.
Moreover, school budgets should continue to  view  educational  material  as
crucial to a sound education of our children.

Part III.E. Text and data mining
Question 53 to 57:
Regarding text and data  mining  (TDM),  the  international  association  of
Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) publishers has committed to  provide
licenses for non-commercial researchers wanting to  mine  the  articles  and
data contained in published  journals  and  books  for  which  they  have  a
subscription,  in  the  framework  of  Licences  for  Europe.  The  European
Commission should all the more  encourage  licensing  in  this  area  as  an
exception would not solve the other issues raised by TDM: the protection  of
data privacy, the risks of unfair competition and the frequent need for  the
publisher to set up  a  specific  technical  environment,  such  as  an  API
(Application Programming Interface), where the researcher may  download  the
content before mining it, which is not cost-free.

Part III.F. User-generated content
Question 58 to 63:
Regarding user-generated content (UGC), there is no legal void for  the  use
of a protected work in the print sector (exception for  short  quotation  or
parody/ pastiche/ caricature, or licence with the right-holder or new  tools
offered by the platforms or Creative commons regime). As a matter  of  fact,
even “non-commercial”  UGC  often  harms  creators’  rights,  competes  with
legitimate sales, and is offered on sites  with  advertising  and/or  profit
motives. The European Commission should  support  licensing,  which  is  the
only solution that respects moral rights of authors. Publishers  are  indeed
developing click-through seamless micro-licensing system for cases  that  go
beyond the quotation exceptions. It would be contradictory to develop a  new
regime aiming at supporting  new  creators,  but  depriving  them  of  their
copyright, and in particular of their moral rights.

Conclusion and questions 7, 21, 72-73:
As a conclusion, the Commission should encourage  individual  licensing  and
contractual freedom in the online environment  as  this  fosters  innovation
and the development of  tailor  made  business  models  and  solutions  that
ultimately benefit all stakeholders, including European readers. Today,  the
development of cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single
Market is not prevented by the existence of different legal  frameworks.  It
should be further encouraged by the European Commission by further  fighting
piracy which represents an unfair competition towards legal  offers  and  by
ensuring a healthy competition between the distribution actors.
