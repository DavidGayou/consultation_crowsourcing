Introduction

We have not seen evidence which would justify such a comprehensive questioning over the EU
copyright regime. In fact, we would argue that copyright legislation and its review are an on-going
process. Since 1996, i.e. over an 18 years’ period, a total of 11 Directives has been debated and
adopted as well as amended, and this without counting relevant horizontal exercises that clearly
impacted on the sector and required a relevant debate (e.g. e-Commerce Directive, Services
Directive, Customs Regulation, interventions on private international law etc.). To this, numerous
communications, a recommendation, several memorandums of understanding and 4 international
Treaties are to be added. Naturally, the CJEU has consistently addressed key issues of interpretation
of EU copyright law, in response to preliminary questions by national courts and thus helped the
process of modernization and uniform interpretation of the relevant body of law. We do not see this
long process as a failure, but one of constant reflection and adaptation.

We would rather point out the urgent need for the European Commission to engage with the
Member States that have not yet implemented or that have incorrectly implemented key aspects of
the adopted body of law. Considering a change in the rules when not all its subjects have made them
their own may encourages further delays in implementation and departure at national level from EU
rules. Furthermore, we would argue that all areas where there is a lack of or incorrect
implementation by Member States should be considered with particular care given the fact that the
overall evidence gathering for the current process will necessarily be patchy and less reliable.

The Licences for Europe process focused on several of the issues raised in this consultation
document. Continued debate has been announced by the Commission regarding a number of
subjects. Additionally, several relevant studies funded by the Commission are not yet available. It is
therefore at a minimum premature for the Commission to consider taking decisions.
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


In particular, the market for online distribution of audio visual content and the business models to
deliver that content are rapidly evolving but are, nevertheless, nascent. As such, they will not benefit
from regulatory intervention and should be allowed to develop in response to market forces and
economic demand.

For all the above reasons, it would seem to us more urgent to pause than to act in haste.



II      Rights and functioning in the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access
   online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?

X NO
We believe this question not to be phrased in a way conducive to useful data gathering. Furthermore,
it does not recognise the nascent stage of development of the EU market for accessing content
services online, one which is developing fast and which will continue to do so in response to
economic demand. The question is very general in scope and may imply reference to very different
scenarios, namely:
     1 access to the home service, when travelling;
     2 access to the service available in the EU country visited or to any other EU service other than
       the home service and/or;
     3 access from the country of residence to any other service available anywhere in the EU.
According to the recent economic study Why territories matter Vertical restraints and portability in
audiovisual media services (Olivier Bomsel and Camille Rosay October 2013) demand for foreign
language programs (cases corresponding to bullets n. 2 and 3 above) is low and limited to migrant
population or expatriates. This study estimates that only a 3.3% of the total population were either
living in another EU country or travelling abroad in the EU on any given day in 2011.
Moreover, the willingness of consumers to pay for such services is currently very low. The Plum study
of March 2012 on The economic potential of cross-border pay-to-view and listen audio-visual media
services funded by the European Commission concludes that 34% of migrants in the sample would be
willing to pay a monthly subscription of €10 or more for “all the channels and programmes they wish
to watch from a particular country”. This figure only reflects the trends of a small number of EU
citizens (34% of a sample of 462 European migrants residing in France, Poland, Spain, Sweden and
UK) which cannot be extrapolated to the 503 million inhabitants of the European Union of 28
Member States.
On the other hand, the most recent study on The value of territorial licensing to the EU (Enders
Analysis October 2013) demonstrates that “willingness or ability to pay for audiovisual content is
lower in low-income countries than in higher-income countries. In such a context, licensees tailor
prices according to disposable income and expenditure patterns. Mandated multi-territorial licensing

                                                                                                      2
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


resulting in a uniform price for content would remove an important level of licensees in satisfying
demand for content.”
The same study notes how “multi-territorial licensing opportunities are already a reality when there
is an economic justification for them”. This is the case for authorized offerings whereby some public
or commercial broadcasters offer certain channels or programmes across borders often to Member
States sharing a common language.
In addition, other kinds of services are being developed which could ensure availability of content
when the user is abroad from his/her country of residence.
That’s the case for instance of:
       Catch-up TV content available for download storable and portable across borders
       Licenses of subtitled original language version with ability to remove subtitles or voiceovers
       Availability of multi-language files for VOD and EST content on iTunes in each country
       Ability to temporarily download VOD rentals and download EST purchases for viewing offline
         (and out of territory)
       Trial cases of temporary download of content offered as part of an SVOD subscription
       Licenses to permit subscribers from one country to access the service available in another
         country when travelling there
       Acknowledgment of broadcast satellite overspill
       Global redemption and access to digital files that are packaged with DVD and Blu-Ray sales
       Ability to access home EST/VOD store (and content purchased from such stores) on OTT
         platforms while abroad

2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide
   online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other
issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance
with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member State,
the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
applications and other software).
X NO OPINION


3.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often
are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests
per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
concerned. [Open question]
We do not receive very many requests.


4.       If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would
be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]



                                                                                                         3
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


If the measure of a problem is the presence of obstacles to cross border availability of content or the
failure to respond to sustainable demand, then we do not think a problem exists that needs to be
solved.


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions)
are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single
Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
X NO – Please explain

The question clearly acknowledges the fact that cross-border availability is already a reality as it
speaks of the possible need for an increase in such availability. Therefore, the real question is
whether the current level of speed in the further development of cross border services or lack
thereof is a problem, and if so whether it should be tackled by policy makers or otherwise.

In fact, the territorial nature and application of copyright1does not in any way preclude EU-wide or
cross-border licensing models, as the European Commission implicitly acknowledges and the existing
examples demonstrate.

On 16 May 2013, the European Audiovisual Observatory took stock of the on-demand audiovisual
services available within Europe. As per the Observatory Press Release:

        “In May 2013, the database (MAVISE) identified 3,087 on-demand audiovisual services: catch-up TV
services, newspapers' video services and various kinds of VoD services (general-interest, films, TV fiction, music,
animation and children's or adult programmes) and various economic models (financed by advertising, pay per
view, direct subscription, services included in a subscription to digital packages, services from public
broadcasters). 2,733 services established in the European Union were identified, 447 of them film VoD services
(or 18% of the total available), 44 were trailer services (not including distributors' promotional websites) and 10
were film archive services……………………………….……………The Observatory estimates that in the European Union
over 52% of the VoD services available in one country are established in another………”

Therefore, an estimated 52% of VOD Services in Europe have a cross-border element. This compares
with an average 20% for services in general2.

As participants in the Licences for Europe process which ended on 13 November 2013, only a few
weeks before the publication of this questionnaire, we stand by the common statement agreed and
co-signed by a number of key players3 at the end of what we considered a very constructive dialogue
stretching over a period of 9 months.

   The CJEU has recognised the principle of territoriality of copyright in different judgements such as Coditel, Lagardere C-192/04 paragraph 46, or
Sportradar C-173/11 paragraph 28.
2
  According to the FAQ on Services Directive provided by DG MARKT and updated to 30.01.2014 “………the European Single Market for services is still not
fully developed and integrated. Tellingly, only about 20% of the services provided in the EU have a cross-border dimension…….”

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


The dialogue and the common statement were opportunities to list/review existing cross-border
services, provide a platform to give visibility to other such instances as and when they develop as well
as recognize the foundations of film making and successful distribution in a proudly diverse Europe.

More precisely, the signatories proposed to engage with the European Commission at a mutually
agreed time to continue to review future market developments regarding cross-border portability of
lawfully acquired audio-visual content while stressing that successful developments in that sense will
depend on protecting and upholding several conditions such as the need for a voluntary and market-
led approach, industry initiatives based on clear and sustainable consumer demand, commercial and
contractual freedom, etc.

It is regrettable that the consultation seems not to take into account the results of the discussion and
the progress made.

We remain convinced that the flexibility given by the current copyright framework needs to be
respected to allow for the further development of voluntary, market-based solutions.

Audiovisual works are by definition experience goods as indicated in several studies4. The benefits
and meaningful experience of such goods can only be evaluated upon consumption and therefore
they are strongly linked to the cultural and linguistic background of the audience.

Producers, distributors, advertisers and in general all actors involved in the value chain need to adapt
av works to their cultural surrounding. This mediatisation which, as indicated in the study Why
territories matter, “builds the social image of a copyrighted expression” covers language adaptation,
branding, marketing, reviewing, buzzing and anything adding context to the work.

In the audiovisual industry each work is a new prototype with a high level of risk which needs its own
business model from its creation until final distribution and exploitation. There is no standardisation
or pre-determined scheme to be applied, and every audiovisual work has high unit production and
marketing costs as well as non-recoverable costs.



    The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions

8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

X YES

The requirements necessary to determine if an activity qualifies as “making available” are sufficiently
clear and deliberately flexible. The key objective pursued by the EU legislator in relation to the
“making available” right was “to cover interactive “on-demand” acts and to ensure legal certainty by
confirming that the communication to the public right is also pertinent when several persons have
access from different places and at different times”5.

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW



The flexibility and broad scope of the right of making available are necessary particularly to address
the complexity of online cross-border services, which are in constant development. In addition, the
right has to be left as broadly applicable as possible in order “to ensure that authors are allowed to
obtain an appropriate reward for the use of their works” (see C-306/05 SGAE p. 36).

Art. 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996 WCT)6 and its implementation in Art. 3 of the EU Copyright
Directive (InfoSoc Directive 2001/29/EC)7 clearly include the act and the right of “making available” as
one component of the more general right of communication to the public of literary and artistic
works8. The expression “communication to the public” covers any means or process other than the
distribution of physical copies, according to the explanatory memorandum of the Directive9. In
general, the right of communication to the public means “any communication to the public by any
means (by wire or wireless) of [literary or artistic] works, including the making available to the public
of the works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place
(wherever) and at a time (whenever) individually chosen by them.” (Art. 8 WCT) It means the authors
enjoy an exclusive right to authorize any communication of the work to the public either outside the
interactive environment (more general right of communication to the public) or inside the interactive
environment, as stated in the second part of Art. 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and Art. 3 of the
InfoSoc Directive. It covers virtually every act causing the public to come into contact with protected
works.

In particular, the making available right relates to a communication whereby the public can access
the works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. The activity of “making available”
online, which is included in the right of communication, thus presumes an action by the
communicator and a potential, but highly relevant action by the consumer. This interactivity is a key
indicator of application of this right and distinguishes the acts of “making available” from other forms
of communication to the public. EU law provides the requisite clarity as to when a particular
exploitation is sufficiently interactive so as to be characterised “making available”. Moreover, the act
of “making available”, as set out in WCT article 8 necessarily encompasses not only the transmission
of a work to members of the public (the receipt of the stream or download) but also the offering of
the work itself (individualized streaming or downloading from online stores, pay-per-view channels,
etc.)10. It is also clearly explained in the preparatory works of the Directive that “the offering of a
work on a publicly accessible site is a crucial act of making it available to the public which in fact
precedes the actual on demand transmission”. This interpretation has been confirmed by the CJEU in
various decisions11.

In fact, the Commission admits in the explanatory note to this consultation that “no question arises
until the act is limited to a single territory. Questions occur rather when the transmission goes cross-
border and covers several territories”. This statement confirms that the European Commission sees
the meaning of the right of making available as sufficiently clear in itself. Its clarity or lack thereof

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


cannot in fact depend on geography. The Commission question therefore must be seen as referring
to issues of applicable law relating to where the very same acts relevant in case of single country
occurrence, take place in cross border situations12. If therefore the right is understood as including
separate activities that can be carried out in different places/countries, choosing to apply the law or
laws that are applicable only to some, but not all such elements may be arbitrary and would limit the
scope of the right.

The interactive nature of the right of making available means that both the law of the country of
establishment of the service provider and the country where transmission takes place will be
applicable. In other words, the fact that the communicator’s activity is indispensable, does not mean
that the law of the COO alone (assuming a COO could be established) should apply and that reception
will have no consequences, in particular in terms of applicable law. The CJEU considers that the place
of making available is “at least” where the public was targeted by the act13.

It follows from all the foregoing that the notion and criteria of the act to make copyright protected
content available to the public and the exclusive right to authorise such activity are sufficiently clear.
The CJEU has given uniform interpretative tools to the scope of the right14, the notion of public 15and
the necessity or not of a new public, the indicative nature of factors such as profit 16, applicable law,
etc.

9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making
available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to
be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relie)

X NO- The notion and the criteria of the right of making available to the public are sufficiently clear.

The right of making available is very important to licensing content on territorial, multi-territorial,
linguistic and other bases and to enforcing rights online. The question implies that by clarification of
the territorial scope the Commission means to establish a single set of rules regarding the localisation
of the act and the applicable law (e.g. target country/ies, country of origin) but it is unclear what the
territorial scope intends to cover and what the target approach means in practice.

   This was established in case C-173/11 (Football Dataco v Sportradar).
14
   The notion of “communication to the public” (SGAE p. 36, FAPL p. 186) must be interpreted broadly to ensure a high level of protection for
rightholders;

15
  The public must be placed in a position to access the works in issue irrespective of the means of communication (SGAE p. 43-46; FAPL p. 192-194; SCF
p. 82); the concept of ‘public’ involves an indeterminate but fairly large number of potential viewers or listeners and account should be taken of the
cumulative effect of a number of potential recipients, considered both collectively and successively (SGAE p. 37-39; SCF p. 84-87)

16
   Profit-making element (for example, if it attracts paying customers) is not essential but a relevant indication that it falls within the scope not only of
the right to equitable remuneration (Article 8 of Directive 1992/100 or 2006/115) but also of the right of communication to the public under Article 3 of
Directive 2001/29 (SGAE, p. 44; FAPL p. 204-206; Airfield p. 80; SCF p. 88 et seq.)16. The profit-making purpose is often an important factor for the CJEU
to distinguish between different actions and to decide whether or not a particular act is considered to be communication to the public which includes
the right to make a work available. In this regard the CJEU found the profit making element established where the action (by a hotel, a bar, etc.) which
gives access to a work to the customers is considered to be an additional service performed with the aim of obtaining some benefit (ultimately financial
results), and that the provision of that service has an influence on the business’s (hotel, bar, etc.) standing and, therefore, on the price (e.g. rooms) (see
by analogy SCF p. 90; SGAE p. 44 and FAPL p. 205).



                                                                                                                                                            7
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


Alternative approaches such as to limit the scope of application to the targeted country/ies of
exploitation or the country of origin would limit protection. They would not only create further
barriers and bottlenecks and negatively affect the recognition of rights, their level of protection and
the possibility of ensuring remuneration for all creative contributors, but it would also undermine
effective enforcement.

Moreover, a limitation would result in expropriation of national rights especially in case of split rights
and in the absence of full harmonisation of important aspects of copyright law at EU level, such as
ownership, originality standards, definitions generally, transfer of rights, contracts, etc. At the same
time, a limitation could also encourage opportunistic choices as to the country and location of origin,
relocation outside the EU, location in several different territories, etc.

Since we maintain that the right of making available is as clear and flexible as it needs to be and
functioning in practice, we caution against policy interventions that limit its scope in cross border
situations. The question where the act takes place in a cross-border situation is about applicable law
and competent jurisdiction and should not interfere with the scope of the right itself.

The Commission recognises that the CJEU already interpreted the relevant provisions and established
the criteria to be taken into consideration to resolve issues such as the localisation of the act of
“making available”. What is not sufficiently emphasised by the Commission is that by saying “at
least”, the CJEU implied that there are other relevant activities that can be useful/relevant to further
localise the act of making available, such as in the country from which the work was communicated
or originates (if it can be established), the place of establishment of the service provider, again if
known and within the EU. The proven fact of targeting the public in a certain territory is therefore
only one relevant factor to establish jurisdiction and to determine the places where defining or
relevant factors to “making available” occur.

Reducing the number of countries where the making available right may potentially be localised by
establishing via legislation that the act occurs in each country where a public is targeted (the
target/exploitation country principle) would not solve any “alleged” problem with regards to the
licensing process for cross-border transactions17. In any case, the authors and rightholders should be
identified and the consent should be obtained prior to making the work available to the public for all
the Member States where the exploitation is intended18.

As to the impact of a possible application of the county of origin principle, it should be noted that
similar intentions to establish that the act of communication occurs in a sole location were proven to
be unsuccessful in the Cable and Satellite Directive (93/83/EC). The Commission itself recognized in
the 2002 report on the application of that Directive that the model of the country of origin principle
failed to be accepted in the marketplace19. We would also add that it is difficult to conceive an
extension of the rule conceived for satellite broadcasting, to the internet.

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


The De Wolf study also concludes that the application of the country of origin principle solves some
but not all the alleged bottlenecks while it might create new ones with regards to applicable law20.
As the study itself acknowledges:

        “Firstly, the localisation (and therefore the entitlement of the different right holders) depends
on the acts of the uploader, who may choose a location in her own favour (generally with lower
copyright protection) or by criteria that are not relevant from a copyright perspective (e.g. an
establishment for fiscal reasons). Secondly, licences granted by the person who owns rights in one
Member State may affect, even undermine the rights of persons in other Member States (in case of
territorial fragmentation). The exploitation of the work by making it available on demand may be
directed at one Member State; while the underlying act of making available to the public is localised
in another Member State (upload, centre of activities of the uploader) and requires the consent of
the right holder in that Member State, which means that the right holder in the Member State of
exploitation is considered irrelevant in this process”21.

Moreover, applying only the law of the “country of origin” (assuming such a country can be identified
and remains stable) would interfere with cross-border enforcement. It would become more
burdensome to show that the site is using the intermediaries’ services (a condition of Art. 8(3)
InfoSoc Directive to apply) and thus infringing copyright in another country if the making available
right would be exclusively subject to the country of origin doctrine. Thus righholders could find their
options and scope for action seriously limited. Finally, we assume that the COO is not being
contemplated for cases of non-EU origin, as in those cases rightholders in the EU would be deprived
of all protection.

In conclusion, the very nature of the making available right for copyright protected works is such that
it takes place both where it is offered and where it is accessible by consumers. The applicable law
remains therefore the law of the country where protection is sought, as per long standing principles
of international copyright law binding the EU and its Member States. This is also a reflection of the
interactive nature of the right, it is vitally important to licensing and to content protection. Any
approach that would amend the nature of this right would risk undermining its utility as a licensing
and enforcement tool.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a
single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for
you?

X NO

The question does not take into consideration that market realities and the way services are offered
in the online environment are complex and diverse and cannot necessarily be equated to a “single act
of exploitation”. The offering of on-demand services implicates the making available and
reproduction rights; different services and business models (up/down-streaming, download to own,
catch-up, etc.) involve more than a single act of exploitation.

This is however not a problem or a barrier, but a fact that reflects the ordinary and orderly course of
business. It is therefore in our view misleading to portray or perceive the various rights involved as
obstacles. The existence and the constantly growing number of online legal offers prove the
functioning of the current regime.

Furthermore, rights related to the production and exploitation of audio-visual content are aggregated
in the producer, thus facilitating licensing of the right/s required in relation to specific business
models.

From all of the above follows that any legislative intervention that intends to limit the scope of
current exclusive rights or their number is an unnecessary measure which would likely have a chilling
effect on innovation, to the detriment of all parties involved, for no apparent benefit.


Linking and browsing

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

YES (Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and
why)

NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and
why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it
should be covered by a copyright exception)

Providing a link is not a category that in itself can be analysed in law, without reference to specific
facts and circumstances that qualify it. We therefore do not think that an unqualified yes or no
answer to this question can be given.

Links are functional tools and one of the possible ways in which content is made available. Therefore,
we see no reasons why relevant laws and jurisprudence would have no impact on it, depending on
the circumstances of given cases. Activities such as providing links to content can be unauthorized
forms of dissemination of the same.

Decisive factors could include whether communication of content via linking relates to a new public,
whether the link to the content is provided after circumvention of technology or another measure
that restricted access to such content to a specific group or via a specific path, etc. Consequently, the
provision of links to enable members of the public to access protected material can be subject to
authorisation by the rightholder if it meets the notion and criteria of an act of making available.

The recent CJEU decision in the so called Svensson22 case unequivocally confirms that while linking is
always an act of communication/making available to the public, its relevance under copyright
depends on specific circumstances. The Court considered that when content is freely available on a
site on the internet, the public is everyone that can access it, i.e. it includes also those who access it
22
     Case C-466/12, Svensson vs. Retriever Sverige AB, 13 February,2014.


                                                                                                              10
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


via a link provided by a different operator, also on the internet, as in this case. Therefore, if another
site links to that content, there is no new public and no additional authorization is needed.

The Court:

       “The public targeted by the initial communication consisted of all potential visitors to the site
       concerned, since, given that access to the works on that site was not subject to any restrictive
       measures, (emphasis added) all Internet users could therefore have free access to them. In
       those circumstances, it must be held that, where all the users of another site to whom the
       works at issue have been communicated by means of a clickable link could access those works
       directly on the site on which they were initially communicated, without the involvement of the
       manager of that other site, the users of the site managed by the latter must be deemed to be
       potential recipients of the initial communication and, therefore, as being part of the public
       taken into account by the copyright holders when they authorized the initial communication.
       Therefore, since there is no new public, the authorization of the copyright holders is not
       required for a communication to the public such as that in the main proceedings.”

On the other hand, linking to content that is made available without consent, or made available on a
restricted access basis (e.g. on a video streaming platform) in whatever form (i.e. to another public)
does infringe copyright. The Court:

       “On the other hand, where a clickable link makes it possible for users of the site on which that
       link appears to circumvent restrictions put in place by the site on which the protected work
       appears in order to restrict public access to that work to the latter site’s subscribers only, and
       the link accordingly constitutes an intervention without which those users would not be able
       to access the works transmitted, (emphasis added) all those users must be deemed to be a
       new public, which was not taken into account by the copyright holders when they authorized
       the initial communication, and accordingly the holders’ authorization is required for such a
       communication to the public. This is the case, in particular, where the work is no longer
       available to the public on the site on which it was initially communicated or where it is
       henceforth available on that site only to a restricted public, while being accessible on another
       Internet site without the copyright holders’ authorization.”

Please also note that the Court reiterates that for there to be an ‘act of communication’, it is
sufficient, in particular, that a work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons
forming that public may access it, irrespective of whether they avail themselves of that opportunity.
Therefore, a potential “new” public is sufficient.


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer,
either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

YES (Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and
why)

NO (Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and
why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception))


                                                                                                          11
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


We don’t think that a general yes or no answer can be given to this question either. Viewing a web
page is considered in this consultation document as a way of browsing as per the general
introduction to this section. Therefore, we assume that the question only refers to an end-user
activity and not to the provision of search results. From an end user perspective, copies necessary to
allow for browsing, i.e. copies on his/her computer may well fall under art 5(1), if the conditions
therein are met. However, copies residing on providers’ servers are not temporary.

Browsing is generally defined and considered as a form of random search for an object that may be
relevant to us for the purpose of further inspection and sometimes acquisition. End user browsing
therefore ordinarily ends where consumption of content takes place. For example, a reproduction
allowing for viewing /streaming an entire film without authorization cannot be browsing. The simple
viewing of a webpage cannot therefore ordinarily be confused with activities that equal consumption
and reproduction of copyrighted material without authorization. It would be important, to further
debate this particular issue to be sure of the limits of the activity considered and which players are
being seen as relevant and possibly benefitting from a general understanding of end users’ browsing
activities. The CJEU is also expected to rule in relevant cases concerning browsing.


Download to own digital content

13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to
resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
X NO OPINION


14.[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of
providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please
specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The law, including jurisprudence on exhaustion, is well established in the EU. Exhaustion applies to
the distribution by way of sale or other transfer of ownership of physical copies of works, including
audio-visual works.

If for example a physical book, CD, DVD or other physical item embodying a copy of a protected work
is our property, we can re-sell or otherwise dispose of that one physical copy as we see fit; we never
owned the work as such, but only that copy. The copy will change hands and as I dispose of that copy,
I will no longer have it and have no right to further distribute the work. Directive 2001/29 expressly
confirms that the rights of communication to the public and making available are not subject to
exhaustion23. Equally, rights not implicating ownership, such as say rental or lending are also not
exhausted. There are good reasons for this:

       Applying exhaustion to the rights implicated in digital transmission would result in a limitation
        to copyright that would be contrary to the 3 step test.



23
  In the UsedSoft case, the CJEU was careful to distinguish computer programs, regulated in the Computer Programs Directive as a lex specialis, from
other works, dealt with in the Information Society Directive.

                                                                                                                                                12
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


     While proponents arguing for an extension of exhaustion to digital intangible products point
      to the possibility of technology which would enable copies to be “forwarded and deleted”,
      the reality is that a verifiable and secure version of such technology does not exist. If it did, it
      would have to cover also the additional copies made available for consumers’ convenience.
      Such technology would also have to discriminate between “sold” copies and licensed access
      and be made applicable within the EU borders.

     One purchased digital copy could potentially be resold millions of times on the secondary
      market, which would - as a direct effect - destroy the first market and therefore be in conflict
      with normal exploitation and unreasonably prejudice rightholders’ interests. While
      secondary markets for physical goods generally do not adversely impact primary markets for
      such goods within the Union, the same would not be true in the digital world, where
      redistribution cannot be controlled, and secondary goods are clones and could easily
      substitute for primary goods.

     Existing and emerging models of licensed access to digital content offer a variety of benefits to
       consumers, such as multiple copies and content access portability. These benefits, predicated
       on secure distribution platforms, would be adversely impacted if exhaustion were to be
       imposed on intangible products.

     Such limitation would have consequences beyond the EU borders, which would need to be
       studied carefully.



Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
works and other subject matter?
X NO
16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A separate identifier registration system for the EU may unwittingly complicate efforts aimed at
constructing global identifiers, which would seem better suited to deal with essentially global
networks.

Should EU focussed work registration be pursued, it should however remain voluntary and not
become a direct or indirect condition of copyright protection. Copyright protection cannot in fact be
subject to formalities, under established international Treaties that bind the EU and its Member
States.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector,
and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases? [Open question]



                                                                                                       13
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


The role of the EU should be to continue to facilitate discussion and encourage the marketplace,
through cross-industry efforts, to evaluate the need for a flexible, global identifier to assist in the
identification and licensing of audio-visual works. Such an identifier could better support new
distribution models and digital formats and extend new capabilities not available with current
registries such as ISAN.

Substantial progress has already been made through the good and promising work of EIDR
(ENTERTAINMENT IDENTIFIER REGISTRY). Led by a board of two industry associations (Movielabs and
Cablelabs), and industry representatives, EIDR is a not-for-profit industry association that includes
among its participants more than 45 members, including audiovisualproducers, internet distributors,
metadata businesses, infrastructure and media services companies and several key industry and
standards organizations. EIDR is intended to be a global, interoperable registry solution for movie and
television content, is designed for automated communication and allows for flexible data hierarchy
(including edits, clips, encoding, composites, etc.).

While no such project would benefit from regulation or mandates, a unique global identifier for film
and TV content such as EIDR can be a big step forward. It is easy to join and allows for the various
participating industries and standards organizations to best customize solutions through multi-
stakeholder feedback. We would be pleased to participate in presenting this project to the EU
authorities as it holds promise for identifying audiovisual content internationally.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

X YES -

We see no reason to modify (limit or extend) current terms of protection applicable at EU level.




III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

X NO – Please explain
The extensive debate over article 5 of the InfoSoc Directive within and among the various EU
institutions is testimony of the fact that the ultimate choice of an exhaustive list of mainly optional
exceptions was the result of a complex debate aimed at achieving the following objectives:
- harmonize exceptions; and
- leave Member States enough flexibility so as to maintain, eliminate or add over time to their
existing list of exceptions and limitations, according to their needs and cultural traditions, but within
a common framework.



                                                                                                      14
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


The list is therefore rather long (20 optional plus one mandatory) and deliberately flexible to allow
for the maximum level of choice. A mandatory list of exceptions would inevitably have taken much
longer to negotiate and would have been shorter as a testimony to the reluctance of Member States
to import notions that do not fit with their national system and traditions.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

X NO – Please explain
We are not aware of difficulties arising from the flexibility Member States enjoy under the current
regime. Incorrect implementation of existing rules can create difficulties and departures from the
overall structure put in place under existing EU law.


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue?
Please explain by referring to specific cases.
X NO
In so far as the list remains optional, we don’t think it needs to be shorter. Any addition to the list
would have to be debated on the basis of solid evidence, to date missing. We look forward to the
publication of relevant studies funded by the European Commission and to reviewing them and
discussing their findings with the EU Institutions and other stakeholders.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

X NO – Please explain why
We are not aware of difficulties arising from the high level of flexibility given by the current regime.
Flexible definitions and optional adoption seem to have amply passed the test of time and be
consistent with better regulation and subsidiarity principles at EU level.


25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (E.g. interpretation by national
courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in
flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain
indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as
its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]
We believe that courts at national level and the CJEU have greatly contributed to a general
understanding of key concepts in the area of exceptions and limitations. Fair use, on the other hand,
is a highly foreign/unknown notion in Europe.

It relies on litigation and may unwittingly favour those who have the necessary resources to litigate;
in the US, for example, it is based on nearly 200 years of jurisprudence. In fact, fair use has a specific
significance in common law jurisdictions. It is a fact that the overwhelming majority of EU Member

                                                                                                       15
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


States are civil law countries. Substituting fair use for, or adding fair use to, the current long list of
exceptions under EU law would be unwise and inevitably bring chaos to the system, including
undermine the extensive case law developed at national and EU level. Would European Courts be
asked to start anew or take on board principles and rulings established in foreign countries?
Generally speaking, we are concerned that not enough evidence is being produced as to the need for
further flexibility (this question) or to the need for less flexibility (question 21). While we remain
ready to discuss specific issues with other stakeholders and the European Institutions, it seems rather
clear that not enough evidence exists for intervention in either direction.

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?X
X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Territoriality of copyright inevitably brings territorial exceptions. We do not see problems in the
territoriality of either.


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

We are not sure how cross border exceptions could possibly be envisaged, apart from a few instances
where (like in the case of orphan works) the exception relates to specific items/works, whose
identification is indispensable as a pre-condition for its application and that rely on a harmonized
framework at EU level.

On the other hand, the cross-border application of exceptions established at national level would
lead to a proliferation of exceptions and their application and their export to countries whose
legislation, legal tradition and culture refuse them. Furthermore, we do not see how remuneration
attached to an optional exception could be honoured in “importing” countries where such exception
may not be applicable, remuneration may not be due or not due to the same categories of
rightholders. Indeed, who pays whom and where would be questions leading to chaos and very
possibly expropriation of copyright protection.



Mass digitisation


41 Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of
content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
X NO – Please explain
The aim of the Memorandum of Understanding on key principles on the digitization and making
available of out-of commerce works signed in 2011 was to facilitate agreements between the parties,
mostly authors, publishers and libraries, on collective licensing schemes to digitize and make
available by public cultural institutions offline “out-of-commerce” printed works (books and journals)
which were published for the first time in the Member State where the agreement is intended to be
signed.


                                                                                                       16
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


As the Commission recognizes in the Frequently Asked Questions24, this Memorandum is a very
specific and targeted-sector driven agreement which cannot be simply extended to other types of
copyrighted works. We are not aware of evidence or impact assessment studies showing that there
are similar needs in relation to the European audiovisual sector.

Due to its specific characteristics, we seriously doubt that the circumstances that justified the MoU in
2011 for the print publishing sector correspond to the audiovisual sector.


User-generated content

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems when
trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,
including across borders?

(b)       [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
          publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
          through your service, including across borders?
(c)       [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the
          way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content
          on the Internet, including across borders?
X NO

These, as well as further questions relating to UGCs are difficult to answer in the absence of a given
definition of what UGC means for the purposes of this consultation. And yet the expression is used in
natural language to refer to very different situations and scenarios, which call for very different legal
analyses. We believe that users should have enough incentive to create original works that would
trigger ordinary protection under copyright.

UGC, to our understanding, do not include scenarios where a user creates new works and at the
opposite end where a user merely distributes pre-existing works (by uploading for example onto a
UGC or social network site).

With regard to the specific issue of UGC as defined in the DEWOLF study, (i.e., including mash-ups,
parodies, incidental use, that consist of quotations etc.), the EU Copyright Acquis provides sufficient
flexibility for UGC to flourish in the EU, as demonstrated by the success of UGC platforms such as
Daily Motion.

Moreover, there are already various mechanisms put in place by various stakeholders such as
content-sharing platforms as well as increasing micro-licensing possibilities addressed in the Licensing
for Europe discussions. We are supportive of initiatives to look at industry-led initiatives and
“solutions” to UGC issues. We note that industry has in the past been constructive also in this area.25

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


With respect to the copyright acquis, Articles 5 (3)(d), (i) and (k) of the InfoSoc Directive already
provide the necessary tools for the Member States to enable UGC creators to quote protected
works, engage in caricature, parody and pastiche as well as rely on exceptions for cases of incidental
inclusion. Collectively, these exceptions coupled with new micro-licensing schemes provide ample
breathing space for UGC. Indeed, there is no evidence of significant problems and hardly any case law
in the EU or even internationally.

59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you experienced
problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)

X NO

(a)        Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you
           have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
X NO


Q62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?
We are not aware of a problem in need of a solution. This view is shared by the De Wolf study26.

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

We take the view that there are no problems that require a legislative solution. The industry,
however, is undertaking several approaches to work across sectors to develop services and
technology while at the same time protecting copyright. One example is the “UGC Principles”,
available in full at www.ugcprinciples.com and which call for a broad range of constructive and
cooperative efforts by copyright owners and UGC services.



IV. Private copying and reprography

64.   In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

X NO – Please explain

No, there is no need for further clarification since the 2001 InfoSoc Directive already sets the main
principles applicable to the private copying exception27. These principles have been further clarified

   In its Article 5(2) (b), the corresponding recitals 35, 38, 39 and 52, the recitals dealing with exceptions and limitations in general (recitals 44, 45 and
52) as well as those on technical protection measures (recitals 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and 53). Moreover, Article 6 paragraph 4, subparagraph 4 is crystal-
clear on the interrelation between private copying and DRMs in case of interactive delivery of copyrighted content on agreed contractual terms.

                                                                                                                                                          18
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


by the CJEU in several cases(28 29 30 31) with 4 important pending decisions32 expected to shed light
over questions such as fair compensation in relation to mobile memory cards or fair compensation
for reproductions made using different sources such as files where the use is approved by the
rightholders and paid for by the customer; files where the use in question is approved by the
rightholders and not paid for by the customer (for example marketing purposes); the user’s own
DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer, etc.; where effective technological measures are not applied, the
user’s own DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer, etc.; where effective technological measures are applied;
third party’s DVD, CD, MP3 player, computer etc.; unlawfully copied works from the Internet or other
sources and files copied lawfully in some other way.

Article 5(2)(b) of the InfoSoc Directive establishes as an option the possibility for Member States to
provide for exceptions or limitations to rightholders’ reproduction right for copies on any medium
made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are not directly or indirectly commercial.
Member States providing for such an exception should establish a system to ensure that right holders
receive fair compensation for the act of copying, taking into account the application or non-
application of technological measures.

Moreover the three steps test, enshrined in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works and other international instruments, applies to all exceptions and limitations (Article
5(5) of the InfoSoc Directive) and constitutes an additional set of conditions that need to be met for
any of the exceptions (including private copying) to occur. The compliance with the three steps test
shall ensure the legality, within the EU framework and also internationally, of the national measures
adopted in the implementation of the InfoSoc Directive. The test has been used by the CJEU and by
national courts as a key interpretative element [on the speciality of cases in which exceptions and
limitations should occur, the guarantee of non-interference with the normal exploitation of works
and the respect for the legitimate interest of rightsholders]33.

The clear flexibility of the system has allowed Member States to adopt and adapt the private copying
exception to their national traditions and to technological change, within common boundaries. While
certain Member States have not provided in their national law for such an exception (UK and Ireland)
or have not opted for a compensation system (Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta), other Member States
have implemented the exception along with a compensation system in the form of levies applied to
recording devices, media and/or equipment (exception made for Spain which since 2012 has
established a compensation system directly allocated to the annual State budget)34.

As indicated above, the role played by the CJEU has been crucial to the uniform interpretation and
application of the exception across Member States that have opted for such an exception under their
national law. In its judgments, the CJEU had the opportunity to look into the main elements of the
private copying exception, such as the notion of fair compensation, the criterion of harm, the liability
of the final users and manufacturer or importers of recording devices or equipment for the payment
of the compensation, etc.

In particular, the CJEU has considered that fair remuneration must be interpreted uniformly in all
Member states that have introduced the exception (Padawan paragraph 37) and that it has to be
necessarily calculated on the basis of the criterion of the harm, even a possible harm, caused to rights
holders (Padawan 42 confirmed by Amazon paragraph 47 and Padawan paragraph 57).

In the Padawan case, the Court clarified the incompatibility of private copying levies applied to
professional uses with EU law by stating that the “indiscriminate application of the private copying
levy, in particular with respect to digital reproduction equipment, devices and media not made
available to private users and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying, is incompatible
with Directive 2001/29”.

The CJEU also stated that the final user who caused the harm by reproducing for private use a
protected work without the authorization of the rightsholders should be the one responsible for the
payment of the compensation and that the collection of levies should be done in the Member States
where the final user resides (Padawan paragraph 42 and Stichting de Thuiskopie versus Opus
paragraphs 29 and 35). Nevertheless, and due to the practical difficulty of identifying and collecting
the levies from every single end-user, European jurisprudence has also recognized the possibility for
Member States to charge the levies to the manufacturer or importer of the media or device for
reproduction of protected works under certain conditions (Padawan, paragraph 46).

In currently pending cases, the Court is expected to make further steps in providing us with updated
and uniform interpretation of the exception. For example, in case C-435/12 ACI Adam and Others,
the Advocate General (AG) Cruz Villalon has already outlined the very important issue of the legality
of the source. In his reasoned opinion, presented on 9 January 2014, the AG unreservedly confirms
that the private copying exception only applies to reproductions made from legitimate sources and
consequently a Member State can only collect levies on reproductions of protected works made from
legitimate sources.

In conclusion, we are convinced of the sufficient clarity of the private copying exception as defined in
the InfoSoc Directive and uniformly interpreted by the CJEU.

65.    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?35
 YES – Please explain
 NO – Please explain

We consider that this question is unclear since the scope and objective is not sufficiently delimited
and can cover multiple cases and different kind of licensed services, where private copying does not
necessarily apply and therefore levies would not apply either. If there is no private copying, levies do
not apply; if the exception applies, levies generally apply and vary according to factors such as the
application or non-application of TPMs.




35
   This issue was also addressed in the Recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and reprography
levies, January 2013.

                                                                                                                                          20
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


A reproduction act of a licensed service should not, in principle, be considered as a private copy
under the exception or limitation regime. If the licensing agreement of a digital service between the
right holder and the service provider or the user includes/authorises individuals to make
reproductions for their private use, the license already covers reproduction and compensation to the
right holder and should not generate the payment of a levy which can only result from application of
the exception. In that sense, the InfoSoc Directive gives relevant and appropriate clarification to that
question.

First of all, recital 35 excludes the possibility for levies when right holders have received previous
payment in some other form such as a licence fee36. Recital 45 of the Directive establishes that
exceptions and limitations referred to in articles 5(2), (3) and (4) should not prevent contractual
relations designed to ensure fair compensation for the rightholders insofar as permitted by national
law. Mr Vitorino arrives at the same conclusion in his Recommendations37 when he states that
“licensed copies should not trigger the application of levies. The opposite view would pave the way for
double payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double payments”.

The CJEU has stressed the importance of the absence of the rights holders’ authorisation when
defining the fair compensation due for an act of private copying (Case C-467/08 Padawan paragraphs
39 and 40 or Joined Cases C457/11 to C-460/11 VG Wort paragraph 3138). In other words, one can say
that when authorisation of the reproduction act lawfully occurs there is no case for further
compensation or, as Mr Vitorino indicates, there is no additional harm to compensate via levies.

Licensing agreements and private copying can co-exist according to the CJEU (VG Wort case Joined
cases C-457/11 to C-460/11 paragraphs 36 to 40), depending on national law and EU principles39. In
such instances, if no license is required or possible under the law to authorize reproduction for
private purposes by a natural person, from a legal source, under the 3 step test, with the exclusion of
instances under Art. 6.4 par. 4 of the InfoSoc Directive and outside the direct or indirect channels of
commerce, the surviving exception would trigger levies, commensurate to the application or non-
application of technical measures. According to Advocate General Sharpston, where fair
compensation is provided for (as it is for the private copying exception as established in the Directive
itself) Member States have the possibility to “provide that rightholders may either renounce any claim
to fair compensation or make their works available for copying subject to contractual arrangements
(such as an appropriate increase in the basic price) which enable them to receive fair compensation
for future copying from those who acquire their works”40. Therefore levies must be calculated in such
a way as to provide fair compensation only to rightholders who have not opted for this option.



36
    Recital 35 of the Directive 2001/29/EC reads: “In certain cases of exceptions or limitations, rightholders should receive fair compensation to
compensate them adequately for the use made of their protected works or other subject-matter. When determining the form, detailed arrangements
and possible level of such fair compensation, account should be taken of the particular circumstances of each case. When evaluating these
circumstances, a valuable criterion would be the possible harm to the rightholders resulting from the act in question. In cases where rightholders have
already received payment in some other form, for instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may be due. The level of fair
compensation should take full account of the degree of use of technological protection measures referred to in this Directive. In certain situations
where the prejudice to the rightholder would be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise”.

38
   In these cases, the CJEU stated that “the purpose of fair compensation is to compensate authors for private copying, without their authorisation, of
their protected works, meaning that it must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by authors, resulting from such a copy which is not
authorised by them
39
   In the same line of thoughts, Advocate General Sharpston concluded in the opinion to the VG Wort case that it is for the Member States to define the
co-existence between contractual arrangements and exceptions/limitations (paragraphs 19 to 21).

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services
based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact
the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’
revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Cloud computing services or other relevant services should not be covered by the private copying
exception insofar as the service should be licensed and all other requirements covering private
copying are not present. As Mr Vitorino explains, cloud computing services need to be based on
licensing agreements with rights holders and the private copying exception is limited to non (directly
or indirectly) commercial private uses and was never conceived to be the basis of commercial
activities of third parties.


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to
levies?

X YES – Please explain
X NO – Please explain

Although we agree with Mr Vitorino that transparency is key to ensure that the appropriate levy is
applied and that no double payment takes place in cases of export of recording devices/equipment,
the visibility of the levies on such products should not (mis)lead consumers to believe that they
have acquired a right to copy and to distribute protected works beyond what it is strictly covered
under the exception.

It is important to note as well that the InfoSoc Directive conceives the exception to be applied to
reproductions made on any medium. However, the Directive does not foresee the possibility for final
users to make reproductions under the exception from any medium or device. This is perfectly
consistent with the 3 step test and its applicability. If copies from and to any medium were included,
the 3 step test would not in practice be applicable, the exception would no longer be a special case,
but the rule, there would be a conflict with the normal exploitation of the work by definition and
prejudice to rights holders would be inevitable.

In any case, it is clear that the payment of a levy should not mislead consumers into believing that
otherwise illegal behaviour is legitimized.


68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods
or services?

X NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for

NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW



70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent
could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States
help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
N/A

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how
would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]

Article 5.2(b) of the InfoSoc Directive provides for an optional exception to the reproduction right. As
an exception, and following the three step test, it must be restricted to certain special cases which do
not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not cause unreasonable prejudice to
rights holders.

Bearing this in mind, it seems impossible to justify both the application of the exception or the
collection of levies for reproductions made from illegal sources. An exception cannot legalise illegal
behaviour; the application of the exception to reproductions made from illegal sources would
unwittingly legalize online infringement.

As we already indicated under question 64, Advocate General Cruz Villalon shares the above view in
the ongoing case ACI Adam and Others. He also expresses criticism towards the Dutch legal system
which allows the downloading of copyrighted content illegally available on the Internet under private
copying, subject to levies.

Legislators at national level are moving towards a clarification of the need for a legal source in order
for private copying to apply as an exception.



V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination
of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?
In our experience, the best way to ensure fair remuneration, including in the form of residuals, for
talent in relation to works and performances, are agreements, individual or collective, depending on
the circumstances. We support and honor the objective by which talent should share in the success
of the work they have contributed to as a result of such agreements. Crucial to the system is to
maintain a seamless licensing process whereby the film producer is responsible for remunerating
directors, performers and other relevant rightsholders and retains the ability to license as a one stop
shop the audiovisual work with a view to maximizing returns, to the benefit of all contributors. Any
system that involves additional intermediaries in licensing or in remuneration claims are almost
inevitably destined to slow down and lower, rather than increase, remuneration of authors and
performers.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)

                                                                                                        23
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW

X NO –

We don’t think legislation is necessary. It is perhaps time for the EU to review via an independent
study the various mechanisms in place at national level. Such a study should also look at collective
bargaining agreements (CBAs) in Member States where they are practiced, and explore ways in which
they could also be available in countries where they are not customary or where legal or other
impediments exist.



74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the
shortcomings you identify?

N/A – See answer to question 72.



VI. Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

We think that the copyright system and its enforcement and interpretation via the courts are
maturing steadily. A series of important decisions have been taken by national courts and the CJEU
over a number of years and there are several more pending before the CJEU, which are expected to
shed light on a number of relevant issues. At this stage, we fear that if some of the ideas expressed as
possible ways forward in this consultation were to be pursued, they could unwittingly exacerbate
infringement or legalize it. We believe that the impact of any measure in the field of IPR must be
assessed also in relation to the reality of copyright infringement and the challenge piracy poses.
While commercial piracy is a priority, comparable damage can be suffered in relation to non-profit
infringement activities that nevertheless crucially devalue exploitation in the works they target. For
these reasons, the phrase “infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose” is
misleading. By way of example, whilst infringements of copyright take place on a huge scale between
individuals who share copyrighted content illegally and do not themselves profit from the sharing, an
ecosystem exists to facilitate the sharing in which linking sites and intermediaries such as advertisers,
search engines and ISPs do profit either directly or indirectly from traffic driven by the sharing.

We believe that at this stage, rather than legislating, an effort should be made to ensure uniform
implementation of existing norms. This is still lacking in many respects. We stand ready to cooperate
in confirming and further identifying such instances and look forward to sustained efforts by the
Commission in ensuring that EU rules are being honoured across the region.

Needless to say, should the Civil Enforcement Directive be reconsidered, we have a number of ideas
in relation to its potential improvement.

76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement
of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers,
domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial
purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
                                                                                                      24
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW



X YES

We believe that implementation of crucial norms is lacking as per our answer to the previous
question.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private
life and protection of personal data?

X YES

The question of the consultation leaves the impression that the right balance with the right for
private life and data protection in particular is at risk due to the current enforcement rules. This is
however inaccurate because the balance is ensured by the Enforcement Directive itself and
safeguarded by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Directive stipulates in Recital 32 that
“it respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union”. The Court has clarified in several recent verdicts
(Promusicae, L'Oreal v. eBay and Sabam v. Netlog) that national courts have to apply the
proportionality test and that they have to weigh all fundamental rights. In the pending CJEU referral
in the case of Constantin/Wega v. Kino (C-314/12) which deals with site-blocking, Advocate General
Villalon stresses the following:

“Ordering an access provider to take a specific blocking measure under Article 8 (3) of Directive
2001/29 against a particular website is not, in principle, disproportionate merely because that
measure requires not inconsiderable costs but can easily be circumvented without any special
technical knowledge. It is for the national courts in each specific case and taking all relevant
circumstances of the case into account to weigh the different fundamental rights of the parties
concerned and to ensure a fair balance between those fundamental rights.”

Balancing fundamental rights is something that national courts as well as the CJEU are doing
routinely. Existing safeguards seem fair and suitable to produce just outcomes.


VII. A single EU Copyright Title


78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as
a single framework for enforcement?

79.     Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member States means that this is a longer term project?

These are very important questions, the answer to which requires deep reflection. In any event,
further harmonization is not here considered as answering a need for reform, which we do not

                                                                                                    25
NBCUniversal SUBMISSION TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU COPYRIGHT REVIEW


recognize as established. Rather, it would be considered as a vehicle for a debate on copyright that
looks at the various elements and objectives of copyright protection, its contribution to society, the
economy, growth and jobs, across the EU, holistically, rather than piecemeal. The contribution of all
relevant stakeholders and a debate with and among all democratic Institutions would be a sine qua
non condition, the results of which could give us guidance as to the feasibility, need and objectives of
such an exercise.

Important sub questions need a reflection such as for example: what would be the scope of such
harmonization, its form (a Regulation that takes the place of existing laws or an additional layer of
regulation), the identification of all the issues that are not currently harmonized and an impact
assessment as to the role they play in a Single Market, etc.
