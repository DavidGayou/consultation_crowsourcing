     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of



16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

     NO
     NO OPINION

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.


22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

licensing of works and other subject matter?

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
From the perspective of libraries and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands the
current terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) are too
long. Cultural heritage institutions hold large collections of works that are still under
copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not exploited
commercially anymore. A term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast
with the commercial life of the large majority of copyright protected works that much
shorter. As a result the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents our
institutions from effectively fulfilling our public interest mission in the digital
environment.
In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer in
commercial exploitation exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result
these are not made available online by the right holders or publishers who lack an
economic incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that own such works have an
incentive to make such works available (it is our public task to provide access to our
collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that are prohibitively high
due to the required diligent searches for the right holder(s) of every work (often heirs).
One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’
when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century
are significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of
which are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still
available commercially).
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of out-of-commerce works
that are in copyright and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above.
Given this, the term of copyright protection should be reduced to the minimum
requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). This
could be a first step towards a more significant reduction of term of protection that would
require a revision of the Berne Convention; the European Union should work in the
relevant international fora to further reduce the term. This should include efforts to agree
on a system where extended copyright protection after an initial automatically granted
term would be only granted if the work is registered by the right holder. The duration of
the initial term should be brought into line with the duration of protection of other IP
rights such as patented inventions (20 years) databases (15 years) and industrial design
rights (25 years). Also compare the Lisbon Council Policy Brief by P.B. Hugenholtz and I.
Hargreaves: www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/LisbonCouncil_policybrief.pdf.
In addition it should be examined if it is possible to establish a cut-off date for copyright
protection that ensures that all works published before that date are not protected by
copyright anymore. Such a cut-off date could vary by sector (European Film Heritage
institutions for example advocate 1920 as a cut-off date for cinematographic works).

 III.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


                                                                                          16
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            17
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The purpose of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society was explicitly (as its title shows) to
create more harmonisation within the EU. Ironically, it ends in a situation of non-
harmonisation. Limitations and exceptions vary a lot from country to country. Only one
exception is mandatory today: the exception for temporary copies (whether this
could/should be regarded as an act of reproduction was also discussed at WIPO in 1996).
In addition to this situation of non-harmonisation, the list of exceptions was made
exhaustive, so no exceptions could be adjusted or expanded to similar uses, and no new
exceptions could be added despite the fact that the world and the information market is
ever changing.
It is in the library’s missions to cooperate and share resources across borders. For the
European library community the existence of 28 different copyright regimes with their
own exceptions makes this cooperation more difficult. One example is that the definition
of “non-commercial” differs from country to country. For other differences see K. Crews’
Study on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries and Archives written for
WIPO at www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_17/sccr_17_2.pdf.
The current situation creates an uneven playing field. Users of the same type should be
able to enjoy the same exceptions (user rights) in all member states. Cultural Heritage
Institutions are increasingly working together on digitisation projects (for example in the
context Europeana) and the fact that the exceptions benefitting publicly accessible
libraries, museums and archives have not been implemented (uniformly) in all
member states, creates unnecessary uncertainties and disadvantages institutions in
some member states vis-a-vis institutions in others.
The 'New renaissance' report on bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online specifically
recommended such collaborations between institutions. The lack of harmonization
introduces unnecessary friction costs for institutions engaging in cross border
collaborations.
The lack of harmonisation and the optional character of the list of exceptions creates an
ambiguous situation throughout the EU. Especially when several Member States work
together in cross-border projects such as:
-        Europeana and all the related projects whose missions are to give online access to
         European Cultural Heritage;
-        the European Library;
-        the EU arctic centre, whose mission is, among others to develop knowledge and
         spread information on the region (http://www.arcticcentre.org/InEnglish/ABOUT-
         US/EU-Arctic-Information-Centre) or the Upper Rhin University;
-        all other cross-border projects shared by several Member States trying to pool
         resources to the benefit of their population and to develop mutual understanding
         and reciprocal knowledge. All those structures work with libraries that are
         supposed to give access to their collection (including digital ones), but can be
         forbidden to do so because of different copyright regimes and absence of
         harmonised exceptions in the respective Member States.

In addition, this lack of harmonisation is even more of an obstacle when projects involve
non-EU states.


                                                                                            18
The transition to digital services enables libraries and cultural heritage institutions to
collaborate across borders and make their collections available across all of Europe and
this needs to be mirrored by harmonising the exceptions benefitting these institutions.
The most comprehensive way to address this issue would be to establish a unified EU
copyright title (compare our answer to Q 78).

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
All existing and additional exceptions for libraries museums and archives should be made
mandatory and non-overridable. They should be harmonised to the fullest extent
possible, after they have been broadened and new ones have been added in line with our
response here below. It is not acceptable that citizens in some members state enjoy a
lesser level of access to the collections held by publicly funded libraries and cultural
heritage institutions simply because of an uneven implementation of exceptions and
limitations of the InfoSoc Directive. This issue becomes more pressing as more and more
activities of these institutions are taking place online.
Moreover, a vitally important issue is that contracts should not be able to override
limitations and exceptions.
All the current exceptions in the EU InfoSoc Directive are drafted on the basis that they
do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not
unreasonably prejudice right holders. This means that making them mandatory in all
Member States should have no negative effect on right holders, while in many cases this
will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to
knowledge and culture or inclusive education. Moreover, the current exception for
libraries, archives and museums in Article 5.2(c) is quite open in the way that it allows
“specific acts of reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for direct or indirect economic
or commercial advantage”, but it is an exception for the reproduction right ONLY, and it
does not cover any other library activity that would be considered fair use in a more
flexible legislation. One example is that the transmission of single scanned articles or
other pieces of information (like one single scanned poem) to individual users or other
libraries, on request, is considered as communication to the public and therefore needs to
be licensed. In the analogue world this is covered by an exception in most countries. This
is a case that in our opinion clearly would pass the three step test, as it is a specific case
and do not harm the interests of the author.
Additionally, to address technological change that has already occurred, the revised
Directive should include new mandatory exceptions. With regard to libraries the status of
e-lending should be clarified (see the answers to questions 37 and 38), possibly via a
new exception. Off-premises or remote access for registered users would be one of the
situations which also need to be covered by new exceptions. In addition, cultural heritage
institutions need to be enabled to make out-of-commerce works in their collections
available online for non-commercial purposes, by expanding the scope of the existing
provision in Article 5(3)n of the Directive. Thus, a functional exception (unlike the one in
the Orphan Works Directive) should be created for mass digitisation and making available

                                                                                           19
Out of Commerce Works by libraries, archives and museums for non-commercial
purposes. Moreover, new exceptions are desirable for text and data mining, for non-
commercial sharing for protected works by individuals, for research and education
purposes, plus Open Access legislation. Finally there is a need to introduce an open norm
(see also our responses to Q 32-34).

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
See our response to Q22: All current existing exceptions have to remain. We do not want
to remove already existing exceptions, only add new ones and find a more flexible
solution than the current one. To list any new specific exceptions that will take into
account any new technological development in years to come would not prove to be
useful. The current list should therefore be combined with more general principles like an
open             norm,              “fair           use”           or             “similar
use”.……………………………………………………………………………………………….


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
Referring to our earlier responses, there is indeed a need for more flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions. The exceptions and limitations in
the InfoSoc Directive were not drafted in a technologically neutral manner which is
problematic in times of accelerated technological progress. We repeat the need for a
more flexible and open solution. Most exceptions are too narrow and specific, even for
2001 when they were written. Also see the report of P.B. Hugenholtz and M.R.F.
Senftleben, Fair Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR, Amsterdam, available at
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/Fair%20Use%20Report%20PUB.pdf.
Copyright seeks to balance the rights of authors and rights holders with those of users .
This balance has been damaged in the past years with only the rights holders benefiting.
The main objective of copyright reform at the European level should be to maintain those
rights and re-establish a new balance where innovation, research as well as legal access
to digital content will be encouraged. Therefore, Copyright law shall balance the right to
access, share and use copyrighted works with the author’s right to protection and
compensation.
Now we have a situation of imbalance, with the exhaustive list of non-mandatory
exceptions, increasing terms of protection (the last one was for sound recordings, in
2011), cumbersome, expensive and monopolistic licensing models for libraries for
electronic journals and books. Libraries have always been important contributors to the
revenues, especially for academic and research publishers, and are paying for what they
acquire. More generally, a recent press release of the British Library shows that “The
economic value that the library delivers is now almost five times its costs, representing a
return on investment of 5:1” and therefore that libraries, archives and information
services have an important role to play in boosting the economy. A competitive market

                                                                                         20
can only innovate by relying on well-educated and informed citizens and consistent
investment in libraries, archives and information services. This generates a good return
on investment and stimulates the economy.
However there is a need to establish fair conditions applying to libraries, archives and
cultural heritage institutions as a whole and not only to right holders. Rules that apply in
the commercial environment (especially for films and music) shall apply differently in
public institutions that do seek a direct or indirect economic interest.
Compared to institutions in countries that have a more flexible approach to exceptions
and limitations European institutions face a competitive disadvantage. Compare for
example the scope of the Google books project in the US and in Europe: in Europe
Google and the libraries are only digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the US the
project also includes in copyright titles. As a result citizens of the US have better access
to their recent (20th century) culture than European citizens.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use fits this
description. It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22) and in
addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations. As long as an open norm is
implemented EU wide its effect on the functioning of the single market would be minimal
while it can be expected to improve the competitive position of European market actors
vis a vis market participants in other jurisdictions that have an open norm.
More reliance on court decisions may be a consequence of an open norm and more
flexibility in copyright legislation. Court decisions take time, but as more court decisions
are made, the pattern of the fair use concept becomes more predictable. Court cases
could however be extremely costly and should not be the only way of seeking for a
solution.
Creating new EU legislation would be even slower than court cases, especially, and
couldn’t reply immediately to the need for new exceptions and limitations as the need
arises. But the advantages of an ambitious legislative approach, open to keep pace with
social and technological changes would be a good sign of the European will to contribute
to the building of the 21st Knowledge Society and of the EU not willing to lag behind
American or Asian front runners.
A European Copyright code could be one alternative.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
At present, the EU only obliges EU countries to adopt one exception (regarding
temporary acts of reproduction), while the adoption of the others is optional. As a result,
something that is legal in one country could be illegal elsewhere. In digitisation and
online projects it is unclear whether certain national exceptions also apply in the country
of the partner institute. Many heritage institutions are faced with the fact that right
holders or CMOs are not willing to provide licences to participate in pan-European
projects such as Europeana.
Another example, the UK is the only Member State without a private copying exception,
so an act that is legal in Spain or the Netherlands suddenly becomes a criminal offence in
the UK. Finland hardly has a parody exception, so a work considered legal in Germany
could be infringing copyright in Finland. From a research perspective, this means that
researchers have difficulties working together and sharing knowledge across borders.
Currently, for example, inter-library loans are hampered across borders.
Right owners and service providers based in stricter jurisdictions often do not accept the
wider scope of freedoms in other jurisdictions and attempt to limit it contractually or use
technical measures. Moreover, most licences impose the law of the state of the publisher
and not that of the subscribing institution, and this leads to the paradox that publishers
from different Member States are contractually not subject to national laws (including
exceptions to copyright) even if they are protected by copyright via national laws. This,
coupled with the fact that there cannot be a tender among several competitors for the
provision of copyright protected content that can be provided just by a single company,
often makes it difficult for libraries to obtain licences really suitable to their needs, even
when their national legislation (copyright law, contract law, public procurement law,
privacy law, etc.) could provide solutions.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 Fair compensation should be regulated within the country of origin. The concept of fair
compensation should include that in some cases a fair compensation also can be no
compensation. Compensation schemes with a legal basis should be based only on uses
where there is clear evidence that it harms the author’s economic rights, also compare
the CJEU’s decision in Case C-271/10 (VEWA/Belgium).

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
… The Netherlands have implemented Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive as a narrow
preservation exception in the Dutch Copyright Act (article 16n). This exception sums up
three specific permitted acts of reproduction: restoration, preservation of works under
threat of decay, and format shifting in case software formats become inaccessible.
However, these narrowly defined acts of reproduction do not fully cover the needs of
libraries and other cultural heritage institutions in the digital environment. Firstly, they
wish to be able to digitize works for preventive purposes before they show signs of

41
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
42
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.
43
   Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                           23
decay, in case harm might be done to their collections (compare the Cologne archive
which collapsed into a metro tunnel). Libraries and other heritage institutions should thus
be allowed to digitize not only materials that ‘threaten to decay’, but their entire
collections to prevent any item from loss – regardless the present condition. As format
shifting is concerned, the Dutch exception in the Directive is worded too restrictively,
given that the preservation of e.g. older computer games requires not just format
shifting but also the emulation of both hardware and software.
Secondly, libraries also want to digitize works in their collections to be able to better fulfil
their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many advantages such as
being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and having lower storage costs.
The current Dutch implementation of article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive does not allow
institutions to structurally create digital copies of works in their collection. This prevents
institutions from fully realising the potential inherent to digitisation of their collections.
This is highly detrimental in an environment where, as the 'New Renaissance' report puts
it, “digitization is more than a technical option, it is a moral obligation”. In addition recital
40 of the Directive which states that 'Such an exception or limitation should not cover
uses made in the context of online delivery of protected works or other subject-matter' is
highly problematic. As online communication of works to the public becomes more and
more important for cultural heritage institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in
such a way is simply anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using digitized works
in a meaningful way.
Thirdly, technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting
cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: often CDs and DVDs are protected
by technological measures, the removal of which would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures
are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.
These measures are lacking in most Member States, to the detriment of libraries.
In order to answer even more precisely:
(a) Print and analogue materials. The digitization for preservation purposes carried out
by publicly accessible cultural institutions is implicitly included among the specific acts of
reproduction referred to in Article 5(2) (c) of the Infosoc Directive. In addition, the EU
has repeatedly recommended the adoption of national policies encouraging the
digitization of cultural heritage. However, this exception is optional and it has been
generally implemented in very narrow terms, so that, in many member states, even
format shifting for preservation purpose is still prohibited, or limited to specific formats
and/or number of copies.
(b) Digital materials fixed on support. CDs and DVDs are often protected by
technological measures (TPM). The removal of TPM would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures
are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content. The
strength of the protection of TPMs compared with the weakness of the provision in favor
of legitimate uses has led in many Member States to the absence of effective guarantee
for legitimate users, including libraries. As a result, many libraries are not able to
reproduce CDs and DVDs legally acquired. These materials will become unusable due to
technological obsolescence in a few years.
(c) Subscribed online content. In the case of online works there is no balance at all. All
the weight is on the side of the copyright holders only. Indeed the exception provided by
Art. 5 (2) (c) of Directive 2001/29 does not apply because, according to art. 6 of the
Directive, it cannot be provided any obligation to the removal of TPM to the benefit of
beneficiaries of exceptions for "works or other subject-matter made available to the
public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that members of the public may access
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them". While the exclusive
distribution right is exhausted by the first sale in EU, so that print materials can enter

                                                                                              24
permanently into the library collection, most content provided online are offered as
temporary services, ceasing upon the expiry of the subscription. In such cases, library
will have to pay again every year to ensure access to those content. In many cases,
even when licenses provide for a perpetual right of access in favor of the library and its
users ((“post-termination clause”), libraries cannot obtain back-up files for conservation,
but can only have access through the producer's website, who does not give guarantees
for long-term preservation. Few licenses only, negotiated by libraries or their consortia,
provide for the delivery of files for local hosting and preservation purposes. Some others
contain a simple obligation to transfer the files in case the company will not be able to
host them.
Although a single library does not have the means to ensure the long-term digital
preservation of large amounts of resources, and the payment of an annual fee could be
justified by the fact that publishers and other commercial providers bear the costs of
storage and management of digital content on their own platforms, Recital 16 of the
Commission Recommendation of 27 October 2011, shows that the problem is that: In
spite of progress made across the EU on the preservation of digital material, in several
Member States no clear and comprehensive policies are in place on the preservation of
digital content. The absence of such policies poses a threat to the survival of digitised
material and may also result in the loss of material produced in digital format (born
digital material). The development of effective means of digital preservation has far-
reaching implications that go beyond cultural institutions. Questions of digital
preservation are relevant for any private or public organisation, which is obliged or which
wishes to preserve digital material ( (http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0039:0045:EN:PDF).
Libraries play an important role in the network of cultural heritage institutions in charge
of preserving nations’ history and archives. They play a specific role in the literature and
information sector by receiving in legal deposit, keeping and preserving, buying,
organizing, promoting and giving access to information books and literature as a whole.
Their mission is done on behalf of the general public, education and research. Several
issues are at stake now: private companies that license content do not have the mission
to defend or take into account the “public interest”, “education”, or “open access to
knowledge” in their business/licence models, so that:
-       economic sustainability of private companies that license content doesn’t offer any
        long term guarantee;
-       the evolution of format leads to a quick obsolescence that needs public
        infrastructure to act outside of economic interest to maintain national memories.
All these issues are implicitly defined missions and policy goals for many libraries, both
public and academic.

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific regulation for libraries and
other cultural institutions, and to secure their public mission.
Updating the copyright framework should be done in order that online content is not
considered a service. Under the current terms, the copyright framework considers online
content as a (just temporary) service. This creates a huge risk for libraries and cultural
heritage institutions, much higher than with print material, given the extreme volatility
and perishability of digital formats. It is a fact that long-term strategies such as digital


                                                                                          25
preservation and data curation are at present largely entrusted to the market and its
fluctuations which works quasi exclusively on a very short-term.
Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to archive
complete copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived materials in the
event that access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An exception
should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-term
preservation, regardless of the format of publication.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]

From our perspective the best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in
article 5(2) c of the InfoSoc Directive, so that it allows institutions to make reproductions
of all works in their collection as long as these are not intended for direct commercial
advantage. In line with our answer to Question 22 this exception should be made
mandatory for all Member States.
As the 'Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights
in the information society' (page 301) highlights, […]to make an exception mandatory
could apply in the case of article 5(2) c), as the development of digital libraries is one of
the key objectives of the Digital Agenda, and the digitization of cultural heritage is
promoted by the Council and the Commission […]. Instead of only allowing specific acts
of reproductions it should allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible
libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related
to their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions made as part of mass
digitization efforts, backup copies and reproductions for format shifting and emulation.
Such reproductions should be limited to use which is not for direct commercial or
economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations allowed for by
the directive (such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in article 5(3)n
that we propose in answer to question 34). Additional benefits would be increasing the
operational efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions.
Moreover, Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions
and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works, regardless of
format or mode of dissemination.
The result of making mandatory both Art. 5(2) c and Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive is
that they would support the specific public mission and responsibility of libraries and
other cultural heritage institutions, that is different from most other users of copyrighted
material. As mentioned in our answer to question 28, their main responsibility is to
preserve, organise, make available, and promote information and literature, whose most
of the content is still copyright protected. Short-term economic interests should not limit
long-term preservation of human’s cultural heritage. Subscribed online content can
escape libraries preservation schemes because of the absence of specific exceptions,
creating a huge risk of a 21st century black hole where a large amount of content could
disappear forever. Broadening the scope of the extension along these lines mirrors the
recommendations made as part of the European Commission commissioned 'Study on
the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information
society' from December 2013.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]

(a) Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers, database
vendors and right holders, impacting collection development, duration of access,
permitted uses. Libraries often entrust negotiation and management of contracts to
national or regional institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the use
of consortia for the negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of
large numbers may introduce rigidities in pricing and business models, encouraging the
purchase or subscription of large packages of content (big deal) rather than the selection
of targeted works, a situation which is difficult to justify with all the extra public finances
spent. Currently there are gaps to be filled in the Directives (e.g. in Infosoc and Database
Directives) and even more in national copyright laws. These gaps contribute to enforce
unbalanced power relations. Unbalanced power relations among right holders, and
between right holders and users do not contribute to establish an environment of best
practices for negotiation and contracts.
To be more precise on the current unsatisfactory situation, at present, licensing
practices are not satisfactory for the following reasons:
Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting and other adaptations should
be permitted not only for long-term preservation purposes, but also for remote access
when needed to ensure technical accessibility and usability by print impaired people, or


                                                                                            27
to effectively integrate acquired or licensed materials in Library information systems,
according to international standards of interoperability. But the copyright holder or the
database producer can refuse both to grant a special licence, and, in case of born-digital
content, to temporarily remove the technological protection measures in order to
facilitate the use, and often they refuse. It should be noted that TPMs protect not only
content, but also metadata related to those content, so that the legal protection of TPMs
affects also access and reuse of metadata for integration within library catalogues and
information discovery systems.
Inter-Library Loan and Document Supply: Cooperation between cultural institutions for
the benefit of the public is explicitly encouraged by numerous international, national and
regional standards. Interlibrary Loan and Document Supply are typical library services
based on the temporary exchange of documents between a library A holding the content
a library B temporarily needing the content. As an internal activity between libraries,
interlibrary exchange should be totally irrelevant for the purposes of protection of
copyright. In the digital environment, such exchange requires transmission in a network
by an intermediary (eg. an internet provider and/or a service provider). But there is
uncertainty on these points: digital reproductions made by libraries for inter-library
exchange purposes can or cannot be considered as “specific acts” of reproduction
covered by art. 5(2)c) of the InfoSoc Directive? According to the InfoSoc Directive (Art.
5(2)c) and 5(1)), a digital reproduction made by the library "A" can or cannot be sent
electronically to the library "B", provided that copy will be used by the library "B" for
legitimate uses such as replacement of damaged parts of a volume in its collection, or to
give to an end-user a print copy within the limits of art. 5(2)b), or communication by
dedicated terminals within the (very strict) limits of art. 5(3)n), or utilization for
administrative procedures within the limits of art. 5(3)(e)? An interlibrary electronic
exchange of protected works, or parts of them, can or cannot be considered one of those
"Temporary acts of reproduction” referred to in Article 5(1), “which are transient or
incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole
purpose is to enable: (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an
intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and
which have no independent economic significance”, and therefore “exempted from the
reproduction right provided for in Article 2"? There are different interpretations on this
matter, and in most Member States there are no explicit exceptions for interlibrary
services. For online content subscribed by libraries, the interlibrary exchange is subject
to licences, and only few publishers allow such digital exchange.

Remote access to born-digital content: From the perspective of Dutch public libraries, the
service to make copyright protected digital works available to registered users outside of
the walls of the library (‘home-access’) has hardly developed, contrary to the situation of
university libraries and libraries connected to education and research institutes.
Publishers, licensors and distributors of e-content are generally speaking very reluctant
to conclude any contractual agreements with generally accessible libraries, museums,
and archives with an ‘open users group’. Publishers, licensors and producers refer to the
risk of profit-decrease by effects of cannibalization. In turn, public libraries refer to the
positive effect that the making available of e-content by libraries may have for market
parties, among others by raising the interest for content with quality and through product
differentiation.

Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most publishers do not allow
the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of protected works acquired or
subscribed by libraries or other cultural institutions and their communication to
registered users through e-Learning platforms. It is generally accepted that the exception
provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and distance
education, and that the fundamental rights it protects (freedom of expression, right to be
informed, right to learn) are of crucial importance. The enforcement of this exception at
European level, prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by licences is of
utmost importance.

                                                                                          28
Open Access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their parent
institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the open
access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers allow
this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side - the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly available
such content.
Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is huge, and
has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the
occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Libraries are
interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their
catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking text
and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be
considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is a
lack of legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining of content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.
Post-termination access to online subscribed content: recalling our answers to Q28-30,
most licences do not provide any guarantee for access to subscribed content after the
termination of a licence. Such content is considered just as a temporary service.
Academic and research libraries have negotiated licenses for decades (even though the
above mentioned problems have been rather consistent over the years). Digital material
until now has to a large extent been focused on research and professional information
(mainly journals), reference and news, and not so much on books and mainstream
journals. Public libraries are a newcomer on this arena, due to the rapid development of
e-books for fiction and general/popular non-fiction. Access to e-material is usually
restricted to the inside of the premises of the library. Public libraries are therefore facing
the risk that their public service to society in the digital domain will not keep pace with
and meets the needs, questions and wishes of their users.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

From our perspective, it shall be permitted for a library to provide remote access to
copyright works in digital form to which it has lawful access, to a registered user, also
see Question 34. Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc
Directive needs to be extended in order that it allows institutions to make available their
digital works and other subject matter for private use via online remote access by their
registered individual users using an authentication system.


                                                                                            29

Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive needs to be
extended in order that it is not considered as an infringement of copyright:
-      making works available for remote access for the user’s private use,
-      by publicly accessible libraries and cultural institutions which do not envisage to
achieve a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit,
-      of a digital work (e-content) which is part of the collections of these institutions,
-      to their registered, individual users,
-      via an authentication system.

In the special case of out-of-commerce works, the exception in Article 5(3)n of the
InfoSoc Directive should allow libraries, museums and archives to make digital copies of
out-of-commerce works in their collections available via open electronic networks such as
the internet for non-commercial purposes.
In general, a reform of the InfoSoc Directive should clarify that every kind of utilization
made by libraries and cultural institutions for their public-interest mission are allowed, no
matter the medium of the transmission. Remote access should be allowed for all the
utilizations discussed above (see answers to Q 32). Exceptions and limitations should
apply to online content as well as to analogue materials, and should be mandatory and
cannot be overridden by contracts or TPMs. Exceptions and limitations should be flexible
and updated to new emerging needs, introducing a general free use provision additional
to the exceptions and limitations expressly provided, as it has been suggested with art.
16 of the IFLA Treaty Proposal (http://www.ifla.org/node/5858) and art. 5.5 of the
European Copyright Code drafted by the Wittem Group. Such a general provision should
allow application by analogy of existing exceptions and limitations, provided they are
consistent with the concept of ‘fair practice’, and/or compliant with the three-step-test,
which presently is recalled by the InfoSoc Directive just to limit the application of
exceptions and limitations. Moreover, contracts should not override any statutory
provisions regarding the entry of a work into the public domain.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,

                                                                                               30
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
(a) Currently, significant barriers can be observed both for public libraries and research
libraries: some publishers refuse to supply their products to libraries, or offer them at
higher prices compared to their print equivalents, or impose default selection such as
bundling, or remove content without informing the library. Moreover, multiple licences
and different use models create lack of clarity on the condition of access to content for
users. Deterioration of users’ rights is evident (e.g. crossing a border with a borrowed
book was not a problem). This is impossible with online access to a library across a
border; usually licenses will not in any case allow e-lending to other libraries or patrons
outside of the library’s defined population (e. g. municipality, university, college).
If licences terms and conditions undermine the library’s missions, and the activities
established to fulfill it, then the introduction of and transition to e-material will result in
reduced availability for library patrons.
Moreover, digital content and availability should be based on the economy of abundance.
Access to digital content offers huge potentiality to overcome physical barriers and
permits user to access to content at a time and in a place individually chosen, without
being restricted by opening hours. In this context, also, libraries remain constraint by
acquisition budgets. Each and every library cannot afford to acquire for themselves all
that is commercially available on the market. They rely on sharing resources with other
libraries in order to give good and adequate service to their patrons.
Quoting OECD (2012), E-books: Developments and Policy Consideration,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k912zxg5svh-en, p. 8: “[…] While e-books can help increase
access to information, DRM represents a significant obstacle to lending of e-books,and
challenges the exercise of such rights by libraries which could be considered a public
interest concern in the foreseeable future. The service must not be proprietary, and be
available for different technological platforms and devices. The DRM generally embedded
in many e-books being produced today does not allow for the kind of free and open
access provided by, for example, public libraries. However, most e-editions in scholarly
libraries are free of DRM.[….] Because e-books are generally made available for lending
only to registered users at a particular library, libraries may need to purchase multiple
licences rather than sharing resources through interlibrary loans. Costs may also be
affected if territorial Digital Rights Management (DRM) restricts libraries to purchasing
geographically-specific editions of books […]”.
More generally, the question is whether it is necessary and desirable to negotiate
agreements to enable electronic lending, given that there is considerable uncertainty
about the legal status of e-lending under EU law. The EU Directive on Rental and Lending
does not explicitly exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its scope and some
libraries argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft decision by the
European Court of Justice they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for
download. In the Netherlands the Vereniging van Openbare Bibliotheken (the

                                                                                             31
Netherlands Association of Public Libraries) has brought the matter before the courts.
They have started a test case against the CMO which collects the Dutch lending right fee,
arguing that they should be allowed to lend e-books under the current Rental Directive.
Their ultimate goal is to have the Dutch court ask questions on this issue to the Court of
Justice of the EU.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on the acquisition and access to e-
books by libraries, highlighting among others the following needs:
-       All e-book titles and other intangible media, which have legally been made
available in whichever form, should be available to libraries for acquisition and access
and making available to the public;
-       All e-books titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;
-       Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats, or cooperate with
libraries in making interoperable formats;
-       Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books for a
limited period of time to a user.
-       It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;
-       Authorised users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by
way of remote access via authentication systems.

see: www.eblida.org/Special%20Events/Key-principles-acquistion-eBooks-
November2012/GB_English%20Version%20Key%20Principles.pdf.
N.B.: as mentioned in the principles, a registered user is a user who has registered with
the library and whose identity is known to the library.

Public lending right (PLR) and e-lending
An adaptation of the PLR under the form of a Legal Licence (including a mandatory
exception whenever necessary) could be a path to follow to ensure a fair remuneration to
authors.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
There is no possible comparison between physical and online collection in libraries.
Currently, libraries can buy all physical publications, when they cannot buy licences to all
commercially available digital content because “the rights holders are free to decide

                                                                                             32
whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such
access. The consequence of this is that the collection building policy may be decided by
the publisher and not by the library “ (see EBLIDA. European Libraries and the challenges
of e-publishing. May 2012, www.eblida.org/news/european-libraries-and-the-challenges-
of-e-publishing.html). In the long run this development threatens to undermine the core
function of libraries to preserve the knowledge and culture of our societies and to keep it
available to the public.
Libraries should have a “right to e-lend”, which will give the library users a “right to e-
read”.
The 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in
the information society' that was commissioned by the European Commission and
published in December 2013 contains an interesting observation. At the end of the
section discussing inter alia the exception benefitting cultural heritage institutions, the
authors observe that:
"The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to apply at
distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online transmission of digital
items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc
Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to look at different uses that
some categories of users (libraries or educational institutions) or some objectives (access
to culture and knowledge or education) would be privileged to undertake under a
limitation of copyright. [...] the space of non-infringing uses could be defined by their
objective and some general conditions, including a more open requirement that the use
does not exceed what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this study
has not made. It could make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and
understandable for users and copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each
exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of protection
of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted."

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.     Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries

                                                                                                33
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following) are
too limited. The issue of mass digitization is far broader than what can be addressed with
the 2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan Works Directive (the other relevant European policy
instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitization of collections
and the subsequent making available of digitized works require a comprehensive
approach that cannot be based the principles of due diligence search and licensing. If we
want to enable European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their collections into the
digital age (and there cannot be any doubt that this is both an important policy objective
and a reasonable expectation of users who as taxpayers fund these organisations) we
need a far more comprehensive approach.
Both the 2012 Orphan Works Directive and the 2011 MoU on Out of Commerce Works
are insufficient to address the copyright issues arising from mass digitisation projects.
The Orphan Works Directive is ill-suited to enable mass digitisation projects. While it will
enable publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives to make orphan works
available after a due diligence search has been carried out for specific works, the
requirement of carrying out due diligence search makes it effectively unusable for mass
digitisation projects as this would require an huge additional investments in both time
and money.
The MoU on Out of Commerce Works could have offered solutions but, in addition to the
fact that national laws fail to fully address the needs of digital libraries, the MoU is
severely limited by its lack of implementation and concrete application across Europe, so
that e.g. cross-border effect is not legally enabled. It is most probable that the question
of cross-border access will be better solved by introducing an exception for libraries,
museums and archives to make available content resulting of mass digitisation projects
by an extension of Articles 5(2)c and 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive. Alternatively,
solutions such as Extended Collective Licensing exist that could well be useful, as stated
in the report available at:
www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf. In the

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             34
Netherlands, cultural heritage institutions (including our library) together with Dutch
CMOs have asked the government to investigate the possibility of introducing a Dutch
legal basis for Extended Collective Licensing

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing for mass digitization of out-of-
commerce works. The mechanism should regulate right clearance in line with the
guidelines provided for in the Out of Commerce MoU guidelines. Moreover, The public
has a legitimate interest in having online access to the collections of all publicly
accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe (see article 27.1 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good reason for limiting mechanisms
that create such access to certain types of content. The approach proposed in reaction to
questions 40 and 34 above, would cover all types of works and other subject matter that
are held by these institutions. This solution would also be in line with the relevant
recommendation made in the 'New Renaissance' report of the Commission appointed
'Comite de Sages' that was published in 2011. The report recommended that 'solutions
for orphan works and out of distribution works must cover all the different sectors:
audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
46
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               35

Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with

facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

borders?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
YES      (ad b) Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit
of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for
rather different implementations at Member States level. Within the ETIN initiative,
facilitated by the copyright of DG Market, and in good collaboration with FEP , IFRRO
and the EWC , the consequences of these different national implementations of the so-
called disability exception are directly felt. For cross-border sharing of adapted materials
published under this exception the most progress can be made when we start sharing
within common languages. German is a common language for more than 3 countries, so
is French, and Dutch is shared between the Netherlands and Flanders. There are specific
copyright issues that are making the cross border sharing under ETIN conditions difficult,
and right holders are hesitant to sign the ETIN cross-border licence/agreement for
precisely these reasons. The most striking example of the difference in the scope of what
is lawfully defined as being print disabled can be found in the German situation. Under
German copyright law the disability exception is restricted to those who cannot read print
for sensory reasons, and this excludes circulation of these copies among persons with
dyslexia. In Austria this is not the case, meaning that a copy made under the German
disability exception could legally be distributed among a wider group of beneficiaries in
Austria than in Germany itself. Rights holders claim that this cannot be done, because
such use was never included when permission was granted to produce the adapted copy.
Also German Trusted Intermediaries (TI’s) cannot and will not carry the responsibility for
the use of the adapted copies they export to other TI’s in different Member States, nor
make a distinction how to distribute the adapted copies they have imported. To quote
Elke Dittmer, director of Medibus (the German distributor of all adapted copies made in
Germany):
“Within ETIN it means that all accessible books made in Germany are only for blind and
visually impaired users in other countries. Those libraries (abroad) who are serving also
other print disabled user can’t distribute our books to them. That means that they have
to classify the book which can be lend out to which category of disabled persons. And I
have no idea how to communicate this to a dyslexic person in Denmark that accessible

books from Netherlands are for him but not the German ones. If we would join ETIN our
colleagues in other countries will face problems with different groups of disabled people
and maybe this is also a legal problem because it could be a discrimination to some
people.” [Elke Dittmer in an email to Katja Mutsaers of DG Market, 17th of June 2012]
Between the Netherlands and Flanders there are also barriers that need to be solved
before a full sharing of the collections made in the Netherlands and those in Flanders can
start to flow optimally. The differences here are not on the level of the copyright
exception in the copyright laws, but in the voluntary arrangements that the Dutch TI and
the Flanders TI have with their respective publishers organizations, for instance whether
online distribution of adapted copies can be done or how the lending of these copies
through public libraries is remunerated per lending. So not only differences in national
copyright laws, but all differences in implementing and servicing the beneficiaries in the
various Member States need to be overcome.
On a national level
On the whole one could say that the Dutch copyright law and its “handicap-exception”
provides a good basis for facilitating and implementing a service to the print disabled in
the Netherlands. For decades workable solutions have been found in voluntary collective
agreements with the rights holders and services have been implemented through a
special budget for Adapted reading that is under the control of the Netherlands Institute
for Public Libraries (Sectorinstituut Openbare Bibliotheken). Of course that budget is not
enough. It allows not even for less than 10% of all that is published in the Netherlands.
No wonder we like to be able to import more text books, especially from the US and the
UK to supply to print disabled students at high schools and universities. Many of these
schools teach courses in English and the adapted version are available in mainly in the
US, but are not allowed to leave the country. TIGAR is the beginning of a solution, but is
(much too) slow and title by title clearance is necessary. In many cases the more recent
books cannot be cleared. ETIN is no solution for the US books for obvious reasons. The
WIPO Marrakesh Treaty gives a hopeful perspective, but it could take years before
important exporting countries like the US and UK will ratify it.
The handicap exception clause in the Dutch copyright law is like many other limitations
subject to the three-step-test of the Bern Convention. Meaning that a right holder may
resist the making of a adapted copy if there is an accessible copy on the commercial
market. At the moment that is very seldom the case. With the emergence of eBooks that
might change rapidly. Can the right holders resist making an accessible version under the
handicap exception when they have published an eBook that could in theory and with a
lot of technical dexterity be read through synthetic speech output? That will indeed be big
setback for the beneficiaries of accessible copies, because the eBook and its ecosystem of
ordering, downloading and reading is not nearly as accessible as the Daisy Audio book
services that the TI’s provide.

(ad a) A primary fundamental problem regarding inclusion is that a person with a
disability can only borrow, not buy adapted materials.
An example of European cross-border obstacles: A Flemish person with a disability
wishing to read a Spanish book, addressing him/herself to the library for people with a
handicap in Spain, called ONCE, cannot get this book, neither by becoming member of
this Spanish library, nor by ordering it through the Flemish Adapted Reading Library
Luisterpunt. The situation is the same in case one is interested in reading English or
German titles.

51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
For all target groups of people with a disability in Europe it is of utmost importance that
the International WIPO Treaty (Marrakesh 2013) is rapidly signed and ratified both by
the European Union, as well as by all individual Member States. The effect will be that
the adaption in a readable format becomes a right; that distribution of books in adapted
reading formats to all types of user groups becomes possible; that cross-border lending
goes without problems; that both online distribution and distribution on a carrier (Daisy-
cd, Braille-print) are service-possibilities. Close cooperation with the adapted reading
user-organisations involved like in the Netherlands, the library sector with the
Oogvereniging, can make clear why swift EU-wide ratification of the WIPO Treaty is
necessary.
On cross border sharing: we need a unified/harmonized definition on what is meant to be
print disabled, based on the human rights as explained in the UN Convention on the
rights of persons. The Marrakesh Treaty points the way forward, but implementation
may take a too long time. We need intermediary solutions that can create a better flow
of adapted accessible copies across borders. The difference between ETIN and TIGAR
should be overcome – through an extension of the ETIN MoU? and both should work
along the same legal frameworks.
On definition of print disabled: we cannot discriminate between types of handicap.
On the definition of accessibility: we need to make the definition of accessibility against
the benchmark of normal reading: that means: an accessible version can be searched
for, found and read in a way that is equitable to what sighted people can. This is
sometimes referred to as the ecosystem of reading. The availability of a simple
(unstructured audio, not synchronized), is not enough to justify the label “accessible” .
Sighted people can flip through their book, browse website, order books, use eReaders,
search in eBooks etc. All these functions should become or stay available to the print
disabled readers too.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
As explained in Question 50: In the Netherlands good cooperation exists between the
producers of accessible copies (Dedicon) and the publishers through their national
association NUV. NUV recommends the cooperation between publishers and Dedicon and
in many cases this leads to efficient production. However, re-selling the adapted copy
back to original owner/publisher hardly ever happens. In the future this might be a
workable model however. That all depends if and to what extent the file formats for
eBooks and those for accessible versions such as Daisy will be truly integrated and
embraced by the marketplace. For the time being the two are not integrated. Dedicon
could however upgrade/convert the publisher’s digital file, not only to make the needed
Braille version, but to enrich the eBook with certain navigation markers, or media
overlays to make it more attractive for the publisher to put on the market. The
collaboration between the Daisy Consortium and the International Digital Publishing
Forum (IDPF) on the ePub3 standard is an excellent facilitator for that.
At the European level: It has become clear that a more equitable situation all over
Europe is necessary. Standards are necessary to develop sustainable solutions for
adapted reading formats. ETIN exists already two years but didn’t realise concrete results
for the target groups. The ETIN-project for cross-border lending of accessible materials

                                                                                          40
for print disabled persons is important, but can only be successful if the EU supports it by
project money and give support to a first step in the project in which cross-border
lending between countries with the same language becomes possible.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are

                                                                                           42
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION
YES    In line with our previous answers (see questions 21 and 22) any tool that would
provide more coherence into the EU copyright system would be very welcome. A single
EU copyright title is necessary in order to achieve a fully functioning single digital market
and enable cross-border effect. See the Wittem Group’s European Copyright Code, April
2010, available at
http://copyrightcode.eu/Wittem_European_copyright_code_21%20april%202010.pdf.

current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

Copyright law reform at the European level is absolutely necessary to simplify the current
complicated regime and the overlapping of different directives. Licensing initiatives alone
will not achieve this.
Meanwhile, the EU should develop mechanisms to ensure that licence clauses cannot
override exceptions and limitations. During the previous Licences for Europe dialogue, it
has never been made possible to discuss this issue, hence the need of urgent decision on
that point. For the same reason, the removal of technological protection measures should
be made compulsory for all legitimate uses.
Compulsory Licenses for libraries
The exclusive rights that exist in regards to published works should not include the right
of refusal to sell to libraries, or to limit their services, both in physical and digital
environment. Commercial licences for libraries should include and not override the
utilizations presently permitted by the InfoSoc and Database Directives. In all cases, the
use of the acquired materials should be allowed for the following purposes:
a.       Research. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates together with its
Authorized Users should, from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, be able
to search, retrieve, and display the licensed materials, print or download and save
individual chapters, articles or items of the licensed materials without legal or
technological impediment. Moreover, they should be able to use data and text mining
technologies to derive information from the licensed materials for computational analysis
and other research purposes.
b.       Education and Teaching. The Library and its Authorized Users should be able to
extract or use information contained in licensed materials for educational, scientific, or
research purposes, including extraction and manipulation of information or images for
the purpose of illustration, explanation, comment, criticism, teaching, research, or
analysis. The Library and/or its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates should be able to
use a reasonable portion of licensed materials in the course of instruction and
communicate same material to Authorized Users at a place and time convenient to them.
c.       Scholarly Sharing. Authorized Users should be able to transmit to a third party
colleague in hard copy or electronically, insubstantial amounts of the licensed materials
for personal, scholarly, educational, scientific, or research uses. Authorized Users should
be able to use, with appropriate credit, figures, tables and brief excerpts from the
Licensed Materials in the Authorized User’s own scientific, scholarly and educational
works. When an Authorized User is the Author of an article which is part of the licensed
materials, and which is the result of a publicly funded research, he/she or the Library
staff should be able to put such work, with appropriate credit to the Publisher, in an Open
Access repository after a reasonable time from the date of its publication.
d.       Interlibrary Loan. Licensee’s staff should be able to provide to other libraries or
cultural institutions whether by post or fax, or secure electronic transmission, whereby
the electronic file is deleted immediately after printing, for the purposes of research or
private study and not for Commercial Use, a single copy of articles, chapters, or other
individual documents from licensed materials.
e.       Technical Accessibility, usability and interoperability. Format shifting and other
adaptations should be permitted for long-term preservation purposes, or to ensure
technical accessibility and usability by visually impaired Authorized users, or to effectively
integrate Licensed Materials in Library information systems, according to international
standards of interoperability. Within the limits of these purposes, the Licensor should
agree to temporarily remove the technical barriers that may prevent adaptations.
f.       Administrative and Judicial Proceedings. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff,
affiliates and authorized users should be able to transmit and/or upload individual articles
to secure electronic systems for judicial and administrative use, including any national

                                                                                            51
research quality assessment (such as RAE in UK or VQR in Italy) and the selection
procedures for academic and professional careers.
g.      Archival Availability. The Library should be granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
perpetual right to use any licensed materials accessed during the License term. The
Licensor should permit the Library to archive one complete copy of the Licensed
Materials, and permit use of the archived materials in the event that access is
discontinued or suspended. Such use should be in accordance with the provisions of the
agreement, which provisions shall survive any termination of it, provided that the
contractual terms of the License agreement will not override any statutory provisions
regarding the entry of the work into the public domain. This means that the archival copy
should be free after the termination of copyright terms, when it enters in the public
domain. It should be prevented the revival of exclusive "sui generis" rights.. Once a work
is out-of-commerce in its all versions, Libraries should be entitled to give unrestricted
access to licensed materials.
We would like to quote some excerpts of the report of P.B. Hugenholtz & M.R.F.
Senftleben (2011, November). Fair Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR.

-       Page 10: “The current lack of flexibility in copyright law undermines the very
fundamental freedoms, societal interests and economic goals that copyright law
traditionally aims to protect and advance. This is the case particularly in the area of
limitations and exceptions – an area where more than elsewhere in the law of copyright
rules have become detailed, rigid and connected to specific states of technology.
Examples abound. Whereas social media have in recent times become an essential
means of social and cultural communication, current copyright law leaves little or no
room for sharing ‘user-generated content’ that builds upon pre-existing works. By the
same token, current limitations and exceptions rarely take into consideration current
educational and scholarly practices, such as the use of copyright protected content in
Powerpoint presentations, in ‘digital classrooms’, on university websites or in scholarly e-
mail correspondence. Existing limitations and exceptions in many Member States’
copyright laws also find it hard to accommodate such essential information tools as
search engines. By impeding these and other uses that should arguably remain outside
the reach of copyright protection, the law’s overly rigorous structure impedes not only
cultural, social and economic progress, but also undermines the social legitimacy of
copyright law proper.”
-       Page 17: “The EU acquis, in other words, contains flexibilities that may be
invisible at the national level because of an overly cautious and restrictive
implementation.”
-       Page 29: “There appear to be good reasons and ample opportunity to
(re)introduce a measure of flexibility in the national copyright systems of Europe. The
need for having more openness in copyright law is almost self-evident in this ‘information
society’ of highly dynamic and unpredictable change. A historic perspective also suggests
that, due to a variety of circumstances, copyright law, particularly in the civil law
jurisdictions of Europe, has lost much of its flexibility in the course of the past century. In
other words, making copyright law in author’s rights regimes more flexible would not go
against the grain of legal tradition. (…) We would therefore recommend to introduce a
measure of flexibility alongside the existing structure of well-defined limitations and
exceptions, and thus combine the advantages of legal security and technological
neutrality.”
To conclude, we would like to ensure that any Copyright review will not lead to EU
legislation which is less progressive than the current regime. A comparative study of the
current 28 copyright regimes identifying the most up-to-date and progressive solutions
developed in Member States could be a good work in parallel to this consultation.
Identifying where citizens and public institutions’ rights benefit the most would open up
new legislative opportunities and would support the need of social harmonisation.
