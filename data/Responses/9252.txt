     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

In the European Audio Visual (AV) industry, film, TV series, and any AV work directors and
scriptwriters, as authors of their work, assign their rights to the producer financing the film,
who licenses the exploitation rights for various types of distribution.
The main issue for directors is to ensure that their work is properly distributed and licensed,
and to be properly remunerated for it.
The current legal framework allows distribution of AV works on a multi territorial basis, but
the market does not demand it.
The European AV market is fragmented, both linguistically and on the types of exploitation
rights actually licensed.
Setting aside linguistically unified territories (i.e. Germany and Austria), multi-territorial
licensing is therefore quite uncommon: AV media services, online or offline, address to
specific markets.
Even online global players (such as iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, etc.) are mostly targeting
national markets through localized versions of their services.
If it were the case, the main issues for AV authors would be:
- to ensure that this type of licensing allows their work the best exposure possible
- to be involved in schemes facilitating the clearance, guaranteeing the fair remuneration of
those rights and a reasonable taxation of their cross border royalty payments.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
- harmonize and enforce authors’ moral rights at the European level (e.g. preventing the
alteration of the film experience by the audience through aggressive advertising practices)
- strong implementation of legislation, enforcing exposition of European AV works, both
through offline and online audio visual media services (AVMS), i.e. enforcement of AVMS
Directive, art. 13
- depending on the multi‐territorial licensing process, harmonized guarantee for authors of a
fair remuneration of the online exploitation of their work, a stronger bargaining position by
the harmonization of European contract law, and transparency and proper representation in
collective managing schemes
- answer from the Commission on the issue of double tax treaties if cross‐border availability
of works must be achieved.
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
- Licensing for a purpose: no distributor in Europe can exploit AV works in all countries for
all type of exploitation; the online global players mentioned in answer to Q.3 promote their
catalogue by editorializing it differently, according to the local market and on a limited

                                                                                              9
number of languages. Why should right holders license multi‐territorial rights if the
exploitation prospects are slim? We moreover believe that rights that have been licensed
should be exploited or reverted.
- Coproduction/financing European AV works: while financing coproductions, some local
partner usually acquires exclusive rights; if their exclusivity was undermined by
multi‐territorial licensing, these splits would be devalued and European coproductions greatly
weakened.
- Undermining European coproduction of AV works would have a negative impact on
cultural diversity.
NO
NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 YES – Please explain
- EU legislation must guarantee a fair remuneration for authors’ work online
distribution, regardless of its country of production or exploitation. A good solution
would be a sort of one‐stop‐shop to clear and make available a full bundle of online rights. It
would also facilitate the payment of European AV authors.
- As licensing in itself is insufficient to achieve proper distribution of the AV works,
100autori is in favour of a legislative obligation of rights exploitation in a given period of
time. If not exploited in that timeframe, rights would revert to the authors.
EU legislation should also allow Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate for all AV
works, regardless of the way they are distributed (in theatres, on TV or online).
- Cross‐border availability of AV works can moreover be achieved quite simply by
investment in production by the companies interested in multi‐territorial licensing.
- We wish also stress the fact that Article 56, TFEU, indeed sets freedom to provide
cross‐border services as central to the functioning of the Internal Market, if the market
demands it; but the population target for cross-border media services has already been

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

of computer programs.

   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.

   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES

It is, though it could be clarified by the introduction of an inalienable authors’ right to
remuneration for their making available right, even when exclusive rights have been
transferred.

NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

 NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
 YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

The recognition of film directors, authors’ rights, remuneration and enforcement of those
rights are handled through legislation and contract law. Harmonization and strengthening of
authors’ rights in legislation are the only comprehensive approach to address these issues.


NO OPINION

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Reproduction right and making available right are usually handled by the same entities in
the AV sector.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
- If the hyperlink is a digital reference to content that can be found on the Internet, it simply
fulfils one of the basic functions of the Internet and does not warrant authorization from the
rightholder.
- Embedded links within a website to legal or illegal sources requires such authorization,
though, especially if there is commercial gain involved. The digital service operator is
considered in this case as “interven[ing] in full knowledge of the consequences of its actions
to give access to protected work to its customers” (CJEU Dec 7 2006 C‐306/05). We expect
CJEU to provide further insight shortly (CJEU “Svensson case” C‐466/12).
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Temporary reproductions such as described in this question are covered under a mandatory
copyright exception and if the rightholder has agreed to the availability of the work on a
webpage, it does not require separate authorization.
Nevertheless, when the reproduction is generated by an illegal platform, the temporary
reproduction should be prohibited.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples

 NO
 NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Allowing the resale of previously purchased digital content would generate severe problems
for the rightholders and the financing of the European AV sector.
- How prevent the first owner to keep a copy of the work purchased? Even through the
“forward and delete” technology, how to ensure rightholders a fair share of the proceeds of
the resale? How to obtain authorization from the rightholders for it?
- The exhaustion principle is not allowed in the current Copyright Directive, to prevent the
resale market to have a detrimental impact on its primary market.




27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              15
C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 YES
 NO
 NO OPINION


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
If such a registration system aimed only at the identification of the work itself, standard
identifiers would be useful to the distribution management and transparency and they would
have to become a single entry point to existing database of information about rights (public
registers, CMOs, etc).
As pledge 9 of the “Licenses for Europe” states, such scheme would facilitate rights
management, discoverability and distribution of AV works.
17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
If such a registration system was to be considered an obligatory formality to exercise the
rights, it would contradict the international treaties (Berne Convention). But if it was based on
simple declaration or claim, it would provide no legal certainty. Would such a registration
system public or private?
To stay in line with Berne formality prohibition, simply keep a record of the contractual chain
would be the best option, and yet a registration system would be costly, time consuming, and
hard to keep up to date.
It seems more realistic to build on existing local database through a set of common standards
and indexes for identifying the works.




29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             16
18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
The attribution of public funds could systematically be accompanied with the attribution of
such an identification number.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The EU should encourage the interoperability norms for rights database, by using the existing
tools: Identification systems for AV works such as the International Standard Audiovisual
Number (ISAN) that is currently being progressively integrated to CMOs database, or the
International Documentation on Audiovisual Works (IDA), the worldwide rights management
system used between CMOs to get accurate information on the works and their right owners.
The EU would also need to help Member States in a common effort for standardization of
national systems, to avoid major discrepancies.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain
The very point is if the terms of copyright protection described here are to establish a legal
environment enabling the harmonious development of artistic creation in the EU.
The compromises found by Member States in the frame of the 1993 Directive harmonizing
the term of protection of copyright are sustainable.
They allow the AV works to join the public domain when their cultural value exceeds their
economic value as the digital environment actually allows the works to be distributed without
degradation during much longer period of time, therefore enhancing their potential economic
lifespan, the current framework seems perfectly adequate.


NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.




36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                            18
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Making the list of exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive mandatory would severely
undermine author’s rights.
This list is comprehensive; the flexibility shown in its implementation in the Member States
correspond to specific demands of national markets and cultural structures. CMOs have been


38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19

exceptions to be implemented without prejudice to the rightholders.

 NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Given the context and the evolution of the use of our works, 100autori is open to discuss the
possibility of exceptions being made mandatory, in the general interest of both the audience,
the authors and their work.
The private copying exception system and the fair compensation relevant to it could be further
harmonised and become mandatory.
Some existing exceptions (quotation, parody) could also be accommodated to new use and the
Internet.
The list of exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive is exhaustive and should remain so as it
has a harmonizing effect, Member States not being able to introduce random new exceptions.

NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
The current framework is the result of a sustainable compromise, and Member States have
had flexibility to implement it. 100autori is not in favour of adding new limitations to the
exhaustive list of exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive, sharing the view of the study De
Wolf & Partners on the application of the Copyright Directive on the matter.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

                                                                                           20
NO – Please explain why
As stated before, Member States already benefit of an important degree of flexibility in
implementing the current framework limitations and exceptions.
The level of protection of authors’ right would potentially be severely hindered. Greater
flexibility would also go against harmonisation and the proper functioning of the Internal
Market.
Furthermore, the concept of “fair use” is alien to the EU Directives and has no basis in
international copyright law (as analysed in the May 2011 Hargreaves report in the UK).
NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
As fervent believers in cultural diversity, 100autori considers that territoriality of limitations
and exceptions actually allows the Member States to develop the necessary legal and cultural
specificities. It moreover matches the territoriality principle of copyright.
It can be noted that, in practice, the discrepancies between Member States in that regard are
small, in particular in the digital environment. Moreover, the management of those limitations
and exceptions are managed by CMOs increasingly collaborating across borders.


NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Fair compensation should indeed be due where the exception is enforced, e.g. where the end
user benefits from it (private copy exception).

                                                                                               21
That compensation must then be provided to the rightholders in their country of residence;
reciprocal agreements between CMOs have made it possible.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

[Open question]
100autori members are deeply committed to the preservation of EU film heritage and to the
opportunities and challenges both preservation and distribution of those works are subject to
in the digital era.
The 2001/29/EC Directive provides carefully crafted exceptions addressing the needs of the
institutions involved, allowing them to fulfil their missions. The CMOs are working with
those institutions on the issue of the use of their collections and their related author’s rights.
As a signatory, through FERA, of the Statement of Principles and Procedures for facilitating
the digitisation of access to an increased interest of European Citizens in European
cinematographic heritage works (WG3 Licenses for Europe), 100autori encourages the
Commission to act as a facilitator in drafting further sustainable agreements between AV
authors’ organisations and film archives institutions on the national and EU level.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?

                                                                                               23
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with

[Open question]
Those agreements are usually and should be handled by licensing. Online remote agreements
should consider the issue of access to the intended beneficiaries and not beyond, to prevent
leakage of protected works online.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?


                                                                                             24

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
The difference between the management of physical and online collections and e-lending is
obviously huge, given the scope of potential users. Therefore, the conditions under which
those activities can be undertaken must be discussed with rightholders. Solutions for the
development of those activities and for remuneration of the authors could be found through
licensing, e.g. via CMOs.

4.     Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries

                                                                                                25
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

 NO – Please explain

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
 YES – Please explain
As stated in answer to Q30, 100autori members are deeply committed to the preservation of
the EU film heritage; as signatories of the WG3 Licenses for Europe Statement through
FERA, 100autori is committed to the roadmap to discuss the terms of restoring, mass
digitising and making available the European film heritage to the public through clearance of
online uses of older AV works.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             26
B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

100autori is a strong supporter of image education, which is an essential tool to familiarise
young audiences with diversity of AV works. We therefore consider that the EU legal
framework should support the showing of AV works in schools and universities by strongly
encouraging national framework agreements between ministries in charge of education and
CMOs.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

[Open question]
Framework agreements managed by CMOs are usually effective and could be widespread.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

51
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
Creative work, both amateur and professional, is subject to copyright rules: the use of existing
protected work needs to be authorized by the rightholder unless an exception can be invoked.


53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

As AV works directors and scriptwriters, 100autori members are familiar with using pre-
existing work in the creative process (e.g. use of music in fiction features, extract of older
works in documentaries): they are therefore aware that the authorization to the use of pre-
existing works ensures the respect of their author’s moral rights.
As it happens, this kind of “professional courtesy” does not necessarily extend to author’s of
user generated contents (UGC).
We are therefore appalled by the formulation of the Q59(a) and Q60(b): users seeking
acknowledgement for property and remuneration of works, and yet falling to recognize the
same of the original rightholders?
A practical solution is needed: collective licensing schemes could be imagined between the
social media platforms and the rightholders representative.

61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
100autori believes more reflection is needed on the UGC issue, and shares the conclusion of
the De Wolf and CRIDS study on the application of the 2001/29/EC Directive that a UGC
exception is a premature option. The relevant existing exceptions to the use should be
properly identified and enforced, and the rest handled through licensing solutions (see answer
to Q58).
We wish to stress that Internet UGC platforms should not remain the main beneficiaries of the
success of UGC, and proper licenses with those platforms should be agreed upon, as well as a
reflexion on their legal status of hosts of contents generating revenue and yet very limited
responsibility regarding the respect of authors and users rights alike.

 IV.           Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of

55
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              34
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
 YES – Please explain
During the latest discussion on the issue of private copy levies (Vitorino report, Mrs Castex
MEP draft report), 100autori, along with FERA, other authors organisations and CMOs, has
insisted on the importance and the need to enforce several key principles:
- private copying must be fairly compensated to the rightholders
- levies on devices and media making private copies is the best way to compensate them
- to be cost-effective, such levies must be collected at the earliest stage of the sales chain
- to be fair, the importance of the compensation must be linked to the works being copied, not
the price of the devices
- private copying levies must be properly adapted to the digital era, as the users copy more on
more connected devices and services.

 NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
 YES – Please explain
Private copies are covered by a statutory exception to copyright under the 2001/29/EC
Directive and therefore cannot be licensed.
Licensing and fair remuneration are two separate issues; the levies are not compensating the
rightholders for a prejudice against their rights, they are providing them with fair

remuneration as a share of the economic success of their works in the market, and for the
benefits generated by offering the copying devices the user needs on protected works.
The private copying levies system corrects inequalities between rightholders and ensures a
fair share of the value to every category of rightholders (e.g. authors who have transferred
their rights to producers for a lump-sum payment).

 NO OPINION

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Levies apply under Member States’ legislation to all recording/storage devices allowing the
making of private copy. 100autori does not consider that they could in any case hinder the
developments of new sustainable business models: levy rates have no impact on the price of
products, why should they have on online services?
True, the uses have changed and copies are more than ever being made by online users
(transfer of AV files or music on hard drives, phones, tablets, computers, etc. by the same user
from his personal library). The point of the levies being sharing economic benefit, fairness
and economic justice, we believe the principle of technical neutrality should apply.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
 YES – Please explain
Stakeholders have stated on many occasions that they agree the amount of the levies should
be visible on contracts, bills, consumers’ invoices and receipts (as it has been recently
implemented in Belgium and France).
100autori actually considers such transparency would help demonstrate how minimal those
levies are in comparison to the overall retail price of the products or services concerned, and
is in favour of better information of the end users (compensation of the freedom of copy
provided by the private copying exception).

 NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

 NO – Please explain
100autori is favourable to further harmonization of the private copying levies to ensure no
undue levy payments occur; the levy should be due in the final user Member State.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Fair remuneration is a key issue for AV works writers and directors. As authors of an AV
work, they should be interested in its economic success, and they need to make a living in
between projects, as a basis for further creative work.
- Strengthening authors’ bargaining position in contract law actually helps strengthening the
entire creative “ecosystem”.
- Collective bargaining is a key tool to organize the remuneration, especially in the digital
exploitation of their work, when the revenue recoupment is difficult to handle by producers
(e.g. 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive) or in case of break in the chain of intermediaries.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
 YES – Please explain
Abolish buy out contract: the majority of Member States prevent their authors by receiving
fair remuneration by allowing their weak bargaining position in their national contract law. In

62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                            38
the absence of legislation to reinforce their rights, they stand in a weakened bargaining
position assigning all their rights to the producer against a one-off fee (buy out contracts:
excessive transfer of rights both in scope and duration, transfer of rights to remuneration).
Standards for fair and enforceable contractual terms in individual contracts are needed:
- harmonization and strong enforcement of moral rights at EU level
- require any waiver of moral rights to be delineated explicitly in writing
- presume the author’s first ownership of copyright, even when a work is created in the course
of employment or on commission, unless expressly agreed otherwise
- require that rights can only be licensed, not assigned, an that licensing only be valid if put
down in writing, including all the terms as agreed between the parties
- require mention of each specific right granted by license
- require the exercise of any right to be specific as to extent, purpose, place, duration and
remuneration
- allow authors to revert rights that are never or no longer used over a certain period of time
- prohibit the licensing of rights that cover exploitation by means not known or reasonably
foreseeable
- allow licensing of rights in future works only under certain conditions
- prohibit sublicensing of rights without the creator’s consent
- require any rights of equitable remuneration to be inalienable and unwaivable
- provide an accounting to the creator and revert rights when it is not done
We consider that any harmonisation of copyright at the EU level must be based on standards
which enforce a strong conception of authorship of the AV works.

 VI.       Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has


64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

                                                                                                      39
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO OPINION
All infringements of copyright should be penalized, and infringements with commercial
purposes more heavily so. The 2004/48/EC Directive remains general and needs
clarifications.


76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Recent Member States regulations (e.g. long-awaited online copyright regulation enforcement
issued in Dec 2013 in Italy) and court decisions (e.g. in France) are clarifying the role of
intermediaries in the IP enforcement infrastructure. Cooperation between rightholders and
providers should be promoted, as it is essential to provide databases of protected content.




65
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           40

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
 NO
 NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
As stated in FERA’s reply to Q14 of the 2011 Commission Green Paper on the online
distribution of AV works, 100autori considers that a unitary title would further complicate the
current situation. 100autori is not in favour of it, as the benefits of such an instrument are
entirely unclear.

matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important

copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
CREATORS AT THE CENTER OF EU COPYRIGHT POLICY
The latest discussions on copyright at EU level showed deep distrust between users’ and
consumers’ group and rightholders representative; in this context, the legitimacy of EU
copyright system that promotes creativity, freedom of expression and dissemination of
European culture in all its diversity must be strengthened.
To achieve this, it is necessary to reconnect the copyright system to the creators and to
author’s rights: let’s remember that, in the European AV sector, people, rather than
corporations, create works.
Film and AV writers and directors, the primary creators of AV works, must be recognized by
the EC copyright policy as the first rightholders and main beneficiaries of the success of their
work as they reach the audience.
We are in need of developing a healthier relationship in the current debate at EU level
between creators and their audience: 100autori believes that further dialogue is needed
between the different stakeholders and the EU institutions. We therefore call for more
collaboration on this fundamental topic for film directors, AV creators and authors in general.
