Bonus Copyright Access is the Swedish RRO (Reproduction Rights Organisation)
licensing copying (reprographic and digital) and making available of works and other
subject matters for education and for internal information within public authorities,
enterprises and organisations.




                                                                                        1

                                                                                         2
  II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
 NO
 NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or
to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
 NO
 NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
Bonus Copyright Access is very rarely asked to grant multi-territory licenses – maximum 2-3
inquires per year. The inquiries come from Swedish educational establishments with students
abroad and from large Swedish companies with subsidiaries abroad. Bonus Copyright Access
is for the moment having discussions with the National Library of Sweden about digitizing
newspapers in the library’s collections and make them available online also for users in
Finland.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
Bonus Copyright Access licences are in most cases based on the Swedish Copyright Act’s
provisions on extended collective licences which provides for a full world repertoire for users


                                                                                             3
in Sweden. Bonus Copyright Access believes that possible problems with multi-territorial
licences are best solved by agreements.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples
The rightholder is at liberty to limit the scope of the mandate granted to Bonus Copyright
Access including limitations on the basis of territoriality and Bonus Copyright Access would
of course have to respect such limitations of the mandate.
    NO
    NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples
    NO
    NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain
In the text and image sector, current legislation is of no hindrance to the development of
multi-territorial solutions. This is also confirmed in documents from the European
Commission (EC)1. Commercial users can generally ask for permission to use a work directly
from the publisher or author and obtain it on a contractual and up to worldwide basis. Equally,
RROs are used to administering rights for secondary uses across borders on the basis of
different legislation and models of RRO operation. Rights for foreign authors and publishers
are generally administered through the network of bilateral agreements between RROs. The
IFRRO-recommended Repertoire Exchange Mandate (REM) for digital licensing by RROs2
does not impose any territorial limitations.

1
  For instance, the Reflection Document on “Creative Content in a European Digital Single Market: Challenges
for the Future”, 22 October 2009, page 12, second paragraph, lines 5-7, states that: “the present legal framework
does not in itself prevent rightholders from commercialising their works on a multi-territory basis”.

As noted by the EU Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston in her Opinion (case C-351/12)3,
typically in the EU, CMOs operate (whether by virtue of a statutory or de facto monopoly)
within the territory of a single Member State and may be required to accept as members any
rightholder resident or established within that State. In such cases, they monitor and grant
licences to users within the same Member State. A user may obtain a licence for a repertoire
managed by a CMO established in another Member State by means of reciprocal
arrangements between CMOs, each of them acting on behalf of the other(s) within its own
territory.4 The principle of copyright territoriality has also been reconfirmed in the Court of
Justice of the European Union’s (CJEU’s) “Premier League” case (C-403/08)5.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
1.        The act of “making available”
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
    YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach6)
    NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief7)?
    YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
    NO
    NO OPINION

   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
7
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

2.       Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
    NO
    NO OPINION


3.       Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Hyperlinks are essential tools for online content delivery and form a part of the
communication process. Specifically, where a hyperlink is comprised of or includes text
protected as the whole or part of a copyright work (see The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd
& Ors v Meltwater Holding BV & Ors [2011] EWCA Civ 890), the ‘provision’ of a hyperlink
would involve the making available of the whole or part of a copyright work. In such
circumstances, the authorisation of the rightholder would be appropriate. This is especially
relevant to the provision of paid-for services to business users, which would otherwise
substitute for services, which currently generate important income streams for content owners.
Bonus Copyright Access understands the purpose of the question as being that of providing
relevant user access to copyright works. There are licensing mechanisms in place to enable
legal user access, so there is no reason to exempt the act of hyperlinking to a copyright work
or other subject matter from the requirement of rightholder authorisation. This view was also
held by the District Court of The Hague when it ruled in the case of Buma/Stemra against the
operator of radio streaming websites ‘Nederland.fm’ and ‘Op.fm’, that a website, which is
embedding or linking to radio-streams without a licence, infringes copyright8. Nevertheless,
not all linking should necessarily be made subject to authorisation. There might be an implied
licence to link in a loyal manner to other websites, as long as the material that is being linked
to has been made available with the consent of the copyright holder.
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
    NO OPINION

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an authorised act should not require
additional consent from the copyright holder. This does not mean that all “cache” memory
copies are to be considered “temporary” or strictly “incidental” ones. The facts of the case
need to be analysed and that is best left to the courts.
Technological development has had the effect that copyright content is increasingly viewed or
listened to (“streamed”) through computer browsers rather than by the making of downloaded
copies. Streaming services are one variety of “on-demand” service, which is specifically
referred to in Recital 10 to Directive 2001/29/EC as requiring protection.
It would not be compatible with common sense of justice that essentially the same act –
making a copy of the monitoring report for the purpose of reading its content – should not
require a licence in one case (when accessed online), while it does in the other (when accessed
by e-mail). If viewing and streaming were not subject to rightholder authorisation, this
anomaly would exist in the online environment generally, where the problem of piracy is
notorious.
Accessing the same content by the easy alternative of visiting the website of an unlicensed
website (claiming to avoid the payment of a licence fee) obviously conflicts with the normal
exploitation of the works and unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the copyright
holders, thereby infringing the three-step test in international conventions that the EU
Member States are party to, as well as Article 5(5) of European Union Copyright Directive
(EUCD). The computer user deliberately creates a copy of the work on his computer screen. It
is his very purpose in opening his browser and going to a webpage for a book or article,
and/or streaming a sound recording or film. The end user must therefore be obliged to obtain a
licence to access the underlying work. This does not prevent a user from reading, viewing or
listening to content that has been made legally available on the web with the consent of the
copyright holder. Any further use is, however, subject to authorisation or licensing.
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
 NO OPINION


4.     Download to own digital content
13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
 NO
 NO OPINION


                                                                                             7
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The creation of a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content
would have many negative business effects. If users were to be allowed to sell e-books or
articles of the same quality as the initial copy, and without wear and tear, it could eventually
lead to the destruction of (parts of) the primary market. This risks, in turn, impacting
negatively on the EU’s foreign relations, given that EU publishers would be less interested in
making low-cost digital content available in countries that cannot afford to pay the full EU
price.
From the perspective of rightholders, by confirming the possibility for sole owners of a digital
copy to invoke successfully the exhaustion doctrine, this might incentivise the drafting of
relevant terms and conditions as mere rights of use, rather than transfers of ownership.
Licences, purporting to grant rights of use without conveying ownership, would likely
become more prevalent.
Large-scale digital retailers, Apple and Amazon, have both obtained patents for systems of
resale for digital items9, which indicates that these retailers may be thinking about setting up
their own marketplace or lending library for the transfer of user-owned digital content. Unless
these marketplaces allow original content creators to benefit from the resale of their goods,
reduced earnings prospects could seriously reduce the creators’ incentive to create.
The ownership of digital files and the possibility of their resale are linked to the application of
the principle of exhaustion to the distribution of tangible copies of works. The answer
provided by CJEU’s case law in the Oracle vs. UsedSoft decision, Case C-128/1110, is limited
only to the specific case of software.
According to the German Regional Court of Bielefeld, the CJEU’s UsedSoft decision is not
applicable to the resale of other digital content.11 More specifically, the German court held
that, because of the nature of the Software Directive 2009/24/EC as lex specialis to Directive
2001/29/EC, the reasoning in UsedSoft could not be applied to other subject-matter. In this
vein, the Landgericht Bielefeld concluded that the EUCD does not permit the application of
the principle of exhaustion to works in non-analogue form.



C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
    YES
    NO
    NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. A registry could be
established on a voluntary basis. The possible advantages of registration, provided it is
established on a voluntary basis, include the identification and proof of rights and the
facilitation of copyright licensing. However, authors and publishers cannot be required or
expected to monitor notifications in the EU and its Member States. Also, in the print sector,
there are already identifiers being used to identify the text, the publication and the author and
publisher, in the form of the ISO standard identifiers ISBN, ISSN, ISTC, ISNI and DOI.
18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?



D.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
Identifiers are crucial for the efficiency and transparency of CMO operations. EC-sponsored
projects such as ARROW and ARROW Plus include references to the desirability of using
international identifier standards such as ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier, ISO
27729) and ISTC (International Standard text Code, ISO 21047). This could be facilitated by
the transposition of ISO 21047 and ISO 27729 into European standards.
EC support could also be given for projects to populate vital databases being used by EU
Projects with agreed international standards. In particular the TEL (The European Library)
database, used also for the ARROW project, could be funded to acquire ISNIs and ISTCs, for
the free use also by other databases, such as those of CMOs and Books in Print. There is a
need for CMOs to be able to use such standards to optimise their distribution activities, as
required under the EU CRM Directive. A feasibility study is desirable to see how the
international standards ISNI and ISTC can be interfaced with the private databases of the
CMOs, for instance, in the text and data field, so that distribution of revenue can be better
automated. Such a study could be financed, totally or partially, by the European Commission.

E.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain
Whether the environment is digital or analogue is irrelevant to the question of term of
protection. Bonus Copyright Access sees no need for a change of the term of copyright at this
stage.
 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
 NO OPINION




                                                                                               9
    III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
    YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
    NO – Please explain
The European Union model is based on the various legal and other models and traditions of
its Member States. They vary substantially and encompass those of civil and common law
countries. This poses challenges to the European Union but it also represents its strength.
There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory exceptions and limitations would have led to
a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen by the EU, based on optional exceptions
and limitations, combined with the development of practical solutions on a case-by-case basis
to enhance harmonisation, when required and appropriate. To the contrary, it has allowed
European countries to play “a major part in shaping a modern and balanced system of IP
rights which not only guarantees innovators their due reward but also stimulates a
competitive market”, as noted by António Campinos, the President of the Office for
Harmonization of the Internal Market (OHIM), and Benoît Battistelli, the President of the
European Patent Office (EPO).12 It has also allowed Europe to take the lead in the
development of innovative solutions, such as Viber, Skype and Spotify, and enabled that
European “IPR-intensive industries account for more than 56 million jobs, or 26% of total
employment, in the EU” compared with, for instance, 19% in the U.S.13
Moreover, copyright legislation remains but one of several elements in the package that
makes up the framework for the creative industries on a national basis. The mix of elements is
carefully chosen to address national requirements and traditions. Flexibility can only be built
on general principles, which leaves implementation to the Member States and the parties
concerned. In the field of copyright, exceptions and limitations in national legislation are
subject to compliance with the three-step test of the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD
Article 5.5, and adapted to the special needs and legal and other traditions of the individual
Member State. In the EU, this general principle is combined with a mandatory and several
optional exceptions and limitations. Bonus Copyright Access does not see how more detailed
norms on a Community level could serve the purpose of improved access to copyright works
or enhanced competitiveness in a changing technological and media environment.
Any further limitations or exceptions would cause a serious risk to publishers’ existing
business models and to the development of new digital business models. This would
ultimately lead to a threat to the publishers’ ability to continue fulfilling their democratic
mission in society, and also place media diversity at risk.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
 NO – Please explain
In accordance with our response to Question 21, Bonus Copyright Access does not see any
particular issue with the exceptions and limitations in the EU Directives being optional. There
does not seem to be a need for existing exceptions to be made mandatory. Flexibility is
important to ensure that the copyright framework is fit to the need of the individual Member
State. Those needs may vary from one Member State to the other and flexibility is needed in a
fast changing environment.
 NO OPINION




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Bonus Copyright Access does not see the need to add new limitations or exceptions to the
existing catalogue. New limitations and exceptions should be the answers to market failures
and the inability to serve users with licensing solutions. Licences are the most flexible
instruments available in order to meet users’ individual needs. The system with extended
collective licences in the Nordic countries makes it possible for rightholders to react fast to
the users’ needs and has proved to serve users, rightholders and the society at large in an
excellent way. New exceptions set prematurely in a fast moving world where technologies
evolve rapidly would certainly stifle business innovation and the ability of rightholders to
develop offers to serve new needs.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
 NO – Please explain why
The fact that the exceptions and limitations in the EUCD are optional provides for a sufficient
degree of flexibility.
 NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.




                                                                                            11
26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
User requests related to rights administered by Bonus Copyright Access are to a large extent
confined to uses and users within the territory of Sweden; demands for cross-border or multi-
territory licensing are extremely limited; only 2-3 per year.
 NO OPINION



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
1. Preservationa and archiving
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by

purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
Bonus Copyright Access is at the moment having discussions with the National Library of
Sweden concerning licences allowing the library to provide remote access, including across
borders, to works in its collections for the purposes of research and private study.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
No problems have been identified so far. Any problems that may arise are best solved by the
negotiating parties.

3. E – lending
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain with specific examples
Bonus Copyright Access has not negotiated agreements with libraries on e-lending. However,
our member organisations and their members have negotiated such agreements, in order to
enable libraries to lend books electronically.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

                                                                                             13
38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
Libraries remain, also in the digital world, important institutions for readers. There is a
difference between genres of publishing, especially between academic and trade, where the
former business model is about licensing 99% of the content to academic libraries, and the
second, of which libraries represent at best 5% of its revenues, which means that in most
countries 99% of the publishers’ revenues are sales through bookshops. As selling access to
copyright works, rather than physical copies, is an essential part of the business model in the
digital environment, in particular in trade-book publishing, library e-lending will more easily
conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
interest of the rightholder. Also, it may no longer be seen to represent a special case, and thus
easily conflict with all three criteria of the three-step test in international conventions that EU
Member States are party to.
E-lending from libraries can, and should, nonetheless, take place, on the basis of contractual
arrangements with copyright holders or their representatives. Arrangements already exist in
several EU Member States. Various models are being explored, and the main challenge now
is to identify and communicate best practices on the range of models that best serve the
assortment of purposes.
One should also note that the e-book market is only at a nascent stage (with 15% in the UK,
but between 2 and 3% in Germany, France, Italy, Scandinavia and Spain and less than 1%
everywhere else), and that sale to consumers represent the majority of the trade-book market.

4. Mass digitisation
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
 NO – Please explain

B.     Teaching
42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for

 YES – Please explain
 NO
The concept of “illustration for teaching” internationally often causes uncertainties, which can
also result in litigation. Bonus Copyright Access began its activities in response to requests
from educational institutions for the facilitating of large scale reproduction of chapters and
other fragments of the world’s scientific and cultural heritage for teaching and research
purposes. Educational institutions continue to be among the main beneficiaries of our
services.
Bonus Copyright Access understands the exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a narrow
exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it reads: to illustrate; which
is far from being the same as planned producing of teaching material. The underlying
rationale for the concept of “illustration for teaching” is to cover minor acts of copying, for
instance a teacher writing something down on the blackboard or a whiteboard, or a student
copying a passage of a text for revision or exam purposes. This understanding of the concept
is in accordance with its wording as well as of the opinions expressed by the foremost experts
on it. Teaching material in whatever format, including multiple copying for classroom use,
cannot and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it would definitely undermine
the normal exploitation of these works.
The licences of Bonus Copyright Access, based on the provisions on extended collective
licences in the Swedish Copyright Act, functions very well to the benefit of educational
institutions, rightholders and the society at large. The licences result in the avoidance of
uncertainty regarding the understanding of the concept of “illustration for teaching”.
It should also be noted that textbook publishers take a proactive role in offering their books in
paper and digital formats to educational establishments.
 NO OPINION

43.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Clarification that “illustration for teaching” does not comprise the reproduction, making
available and distribution of teaching material, such as in the form of arranged, planned or
structured multiple copies for classroom use, compilations, e-reserves and the sort would be
appropriate. Such access to works is offered by authors and publishers directly, or through
rights administration by Bonus Copyright Access and other CMOs.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Scientific and research communities already make extensive use of individual licensing
schemes offered by publishers, combined with collective schemes offered by Bonus
Copyright Access, also for online use of works for teaching or research purposes.

                                                                                               15
Bonus Copyright Access offers legal uses of copyright works that complements licensing by
authors and publishers. The licences of Bonus Copyright Access include scanning of books,
journals, magazines, etc., copying from electronic carriers and Internet downloads for a
variety of uses, including for the printing out of a hard copy, posting to internal networks
accessible to authorised users specified in the licence, inclusion in course packs, and other
relevant uses. The arrangements encompass and clarify the use of works for “illustration for
teaching”.

As the licences are based on the provisions on extended collective licences in the Swedish
Copyright Act they provide the users with the world repertoire to the benefit of users,
rightholders and the society at large.

45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

46.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The preferred option is to encourage solutions and to protect market-based offers by ensuring
that: any limitation for the benefit of teaching is limited to small parts; copies made under the
limitation remain in the hands of the teacher; rightholders are named and receive fair
remuneration; certain categories of works can be excluded from the limitation or exception;
educational material is promoted as crucial to a sound education, providing cultural vitality
and economic prosperity; interoperability is an important criterion when providing for e-
reading possibilities and/or e-reading material in education.
The EC’s and EU Member State’s support, as required by national legal traditions and
requirements, to individual and collective rights management schemes would be appropriate
and welcome. Entering into individual and collective licensing schemes offered to educational
establishments by rightholders and RROs such as Bonus Copyright Access is what provides
the broadest and most adequate legal access to intellectual property to the teaching and
research communities. In a fast changing world, where technologies move with an
unprecedented speed, regulations do not have the ability to offer the required flexibility.
Licensing agreements do. They offer comprehensive tailor-made solutions to access scientific
and literary works to meet the needs of educational institutions. This is the safest, simplest,
fastest, most innovative, most convenient and most cost efficient way to seamless access to
high quality teaching material from multiple authors and publishers. What’s more, flourishing
local cultural industries and a healthy educational system with broad access to local resources
contributes significantly to the nation’s economy and employment.

48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
The use of copyright material for research purposes is commonly comprised in the licences
offered by publishers. The licences all Swedish higher education establishments have signed
with Bonus Copyright Access supplement these licences. Also private enterprises can sign
licences with us covering the use of content for research purposes.

The licences of Bonus Copyright Access include scanning of books, journals, magazines, etc.,
copying from electronic carriers and Internet downloads for a variety of uses, including for
the printing out of a hard copy, posting to internal networks accessible to authorised users
specified in the licence, inclusion in course packs, and other relevant uses. As the licences are
based on the provisions on extended collective licences in the Swedish Copyright Act they
provide for use of content for research purposes from the world repertoire.


D.     Disabilities
50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across

51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?


52.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
Publishers are increasingly publishing books in the e-Pub format, which can be directly
converted into files accessible to persons who are print disabled.14 Those files can be sold to
users directly or to institutions serving the community of the print disabled.

Exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights in favour of persons who are blind, visually
impaired, or otherwise print disabled, exist in the Swedish Copyright Act.


E.         Text and data mining
53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
 NO – Please explain
There are no impediments to Text and Data Mining (TDM). Authors and publishers are not
blocking access for TDM. Rather, they are offering solutions, and, to this end, for instance,
the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical publishers (STM) has
issued a statement and a sample licence15. Through this statement, signatory publishers
commit to granting the necessary copyright licences to permit the text and data mining of
copyright-protected works and other subject-matter on reasonable terms for non-commercial
scientific research purposes in the EU. They will work with rights clearance agents as
necessary, implement licensing systems to facilitate easy “one-to-many” rights clearance and
platforms, and continue to develop relevant technological solutions to facilitate the access in
an efficient way. Bonus Copyright Access has not received any inquiries about licences for
TDM.
 NO OPINION

54.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Question 53 is presented in a way that requires a “No”-response from us. This does, however,
not mean that there are no problems linked to Text and Data Mining (TDM) from the side of
the rightholders or their representatives. The main ones are the need for clear and agreed
definitions of text mining and data mining; right of the rightholders to control access to their

databases; protection against unfair competition linked to commercial exploitation of text and
data mining; and the lack of constructive dialogue with some key user groups, in particular
those who walked out of the European Commission Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue
initiative. The preferred way to solve this is to clarify that there will be no exception for
TDM.

elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

There is no need to change articles 5.2 (a) and 5.2 (b) of the EUCD. In particular, it must

is provided to the rightholders.
There is, however, a need for clarification that, in respect of text and image levies,
rightholders eligible for fair compensation comprise both authors and publishers.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
Wider legal access to works can only be achieved through appropriate mechanisms which
include direct licensing by authors and publishers and collective management of rights,
combined with financial incentives, protection against infringement and copyright
enforcement, including efficient combating of piracy and other forms of unauthorised
reproduction. CMOs play an indispensable role in assisting authors and publishers to enable
wider legal access to their works and in awareness raising and enforcement of rights.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
Collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to address copyright infringement and
enforcement issues is welcome. The Commission could facilitate initiatives in this respect
through financial contributions to awareness-raising campaigns. The use of systems to inform
about authorised use (e.g. through search engines using the ACAP19) is also highly welcome
and should be encouraged. These actions help in enforcing contractual terms and preventing
the networks from being used to infringe intellectual property.

The Commission should also encourage the investment in new business models. The
establishment of a sustainable legal offer, reflecting the cultural diversity of the European
written sector, can only take place in an environment ensuring the full respect of copyright
and, therefore, the – financial – independence of creators. Against this background, we
request that the Commission maintains a stable and predictable legal framework, promoting
its rationale and its enforcement by all players.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
The right balance of protection of copyright with other fundamental rights, such as privacy
and protection of personal data, needs to be found on the basis of the principle of
proportionality, in the discretion of Member States (see the cases Productores de Música de
España (Promusicae) v Telefónica de España SAU (C-275/0620) and LSG-Gesellschaft zur

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
In respect of the copyright legal framework, the EU should continue to pursue a pragmatic
approach. Rather than emphasising on a single EU Copyright Title, the focus should be on the
adoption of an overall intellectual property (IP) strategy. Several studies have documented the
importance of the IP sector to the EU economy and employment: For example, IPR intensive
industries contribute to 39% of the EU’s GDP and 26% of the EU’s employment; 90% of its
export comes from IP intensive industries. Within the IP sector, the copyright sector
contributes with a positive trade balance. On a short, medium and longer term, an overarching
EU IP strategy is required and urgent to maintain this situation.
Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources and unnecessarily
distract focus from the important work on an overall EU IP strategy. Also, it is difficult to see
how it could be established on the basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The
different traditions and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit
from being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst EU Member
States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is difficult to see that an overarching EU
Copyright Title is required.

VIII.     Other issues

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
Bonus Copyright Access suggests that the creation of a specialised panel of judges,
responsible for copyright legal matters, is created at the CJEU. More and more cases on
copyright issues are decided by the CJEU. This requires a stable institution with copyright
experts.
