             I. RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET


A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?


3. How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of
requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
concerned.


The Austrian Filmmakers Association represents interests of filmmakers, so we do not grant
licences, because rights are transferred by our members to the producers. So there is
practically no request for multi-territorial licences at all.
The works of our members are exploited by their producers who can license the exploitation
rights. Audiovisual authors are unable to control the distribution and the remuneration for the
exploitation of their works. They are interested in developing a model for the collection and
distribution of audiovisual authors’ remuneration for the online exploitation of their works.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the best way
to tackle them?


The European legislator should provide audiovisual authors with a harmonized guarantee of
remuneration for the online exploitation of their works. This should be implemented by a
unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration.
Collective management should guarantee actual remuneration for the online exploitation of
audiovisual works for the authors, and be helpful to users who know where to get the
licences from.


5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?


YES - Please explain
Of course audiovisual authors want their works to be available all over Europe as long as all
required authorisations have been regularly acquired from the producers. In fact there is no
distributor in Europe that is able to exploit audiovisual works in all countries for all modes of
exploitation. Even audiovisual media services, who could technically exploit audiovisual
works on a worldwide basis, target specific markets and promote their catalogue only in a
limited number of languages.


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are
needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


NO - Please explain


                                                                                                                   1
There is no need for legislative changes to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the internal market. The Commission should consider legal initiatives to ensure a
system of higher protection for rightholders and fair remuneration for the usage of their
works.


B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in
   digital transmissions?

1. The act of “making available”


9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief)?


NO
There is no problem with the “territorial scope” of the making available right. We do not think
that a clarification of the territorial scope would have any impact on the recognition of the
authors’ rights, the possible transfer of rights and their remuneration.


2. Two rights involved in a single exploitation


     10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment
     (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


NO
The “reproduction right” and the “making available right” are two different exclusive rights
provided by international, European and national copyright laws and their separate
application has never created any problems. Usually rightholders cooperate with each other
to provide services with the relevant rights.


3. Linking and browsing


     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
     copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
     rightholder?


YES – under certain circumstances

Austrian Filmmakers Association does not want at all to prevent the usage of the Internet.
But of course it has to be considered, that there are many technically different ways of
linking. A hyperlink as such of course should not need the authorisation of the rightholder,
but for embedded or framed links within websites, authorisation is needed, especially if the
linking generates commercial gain.




                                                                                                            2
4. Download to own digital content


14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


The exhaustion of rights concerning “digital distribution” is not the right way to handle the
resale of digital files such as films or other audiovisual works, as digital distribution varies
from physical distribution in many significant ways.


C. Registration of works


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
works and other subject matter?


NO

There is no need to create a new “registration system” for the identification and licensing of
works. The existing systems already administer lots of information about rightholders, their
works and the usage of works on a national, European and international level and grant
relating licenses.



     17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


There is in fact no need to develop new systems. Such a registration system would be
extremely costly, time consuming and would likely never be reliable since it would constantly
have to be kept up-to-date.


D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


         19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector,
         and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
         databases?



There are approved systems: “International Standard Audiovisual Number” (ISAN),
Entertainment Identifier EIDR) and International Documentation on Audiovisual Works (IDA).
The European Union could help in building a portal giving some public information and
visibility to these tools and how they work together.


E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

         20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?




                                                                                                              3
Yes - Please explain
Austrian Filmmakers Association thinks that the term of protection should neither changed
nor be shortened. This would have negative impacts on the ability of rightholders to exploit
their works during the period of the exclusivity of their rights.



III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.     Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


NO - Please explain
The current EU law and international treaties provide sufficient flexibility for copyright and
exceptions and limitations. There is no need for any new exceptions. The list of 20
exceptions and limitations of the Copyright Directive includes all possible exceptions in the
EU, but not for direct implementation by all Member States. Making this list mandatory would
undermine the protection of authors’ rights.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of
harmonisation of such exceptions?


NO.


23.     Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue?
Please explain by referring to specific cases.


There is no need for new limitations, therefore we are against any additional exceptions.


24.     Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility
in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


NO - Please explain
We are against the introduction of a US-type “fair use” exception in Europe, because this is
based on a different judicial system. A higher number of disputes and court cases would be
fundamentally in contradiction with the Single Market objectives.


26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?


NO - Please explain
The territoriality of exceptions and limitations matches the “territoriality principle” of copyright
and respects different legal and cultural specificities in the member states. So we do not
constitute any problems.

                                                                                                            4
27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border
effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Fair compensation is due in the place where the end user benefits from the exception and it
is crucial that remuneration is provided to the rightholders in the country where they live.


F. User-generated content


58. (c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other
subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?


YES - Please explain
Whether amateur or professional, creative works are subject to the same copyright rules.
That means that the use of existing protected works needs to be authorised by the
rightholder. The European legislator has not harmonized “moral rights” which of course is
very important. The author has to dispose of his work.
The solution to user-generated content could be in licensing schemes concluded between
rightholders’ representatives, the social media platforms as well as micro-licences for small
users.


61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


The use of pre-existing protected works to create user-generated content needs the
authorisation of the authors or their representatives.
A Commission Communication on user-generated content to clarify what uses are allowed
and give an opinion on what exceptions are relevant may be useful.



IV. Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and
reprography exceptions in the digital environment?



NO - Please explain
The copyright directive has given interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of
private copying exception, there is no need to deal further with the scope and application of
the system at EU level.


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been
licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying
levies?


                                                                                                               5
YES - Please explain
The private copying system corrects inequalities between rightholders and guarantees that
each category of rightholders benefits from a fair share of the value.
Rightholders, such as audiovisual authors who transferred their exclusive rights to the
producers, do not have any direct relation with digital services and therefore, no other
possibility to be paid directly.
Private copies cannot be licensed since they are covered by a statutory exception to
copyright under the copyright directive.
Therefore “licensing” and “fair compensation for private copying” can only be separate
issues. Moreover, if the private copying exception was questioned and private copies
inserted into licences, the ones that would suffer most from such a change would be
consumers and authors, the consumers losing their freedom to copy and the authors their
fair compensation.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on
cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development
and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


We are convinced that the application of levies to online services is justified and would not
interfere the development and functioning of new business models.
Consumers transfer songs and videos from computers to various media (hard drives,
phones, tablets, online lockers) in order to save and access their personal libraries whenever
and wherever they want. All of these processes are acts of private copying.
In addition, in line with the principle of technical neutrality, copies made via “cloud services”.
Many have the same purpose (private use) as the copies made by private individuals on their
phones, tablets, etc. so they should be included in the private copying system.



V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate
remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?


Fair remuneration of authors is a very important issue for us; adequate remuneration should
relate to the use made of the authors’ works and should in particular reward the success of
works. This is why “buy-out contracts”, which prevent fair remuneration, would never amount
to mechanisms guaranteeing adequate remuneration.
Contractual practices in the vast majority of European countries deprive audiovisual authors
of their rights and prevent them from receiving fair remuneration, not only but in particular for
the online distribution of their works. Audiovisual authors in most countries are forced,
because of their weak bargaining position and the absence of legislation to protect them, to
assign all their rights and receive a one-off fee at the production stage with no further
payments linked to the exploitation of the work, except for collectively managed rights such
as “cable retransmission” and “private copying”.
These further payments linked to the exploitation of the work are however essential for
authors to make a living in-between projects. The characteristic of this profession is that it
can take years to prepare a film and enter into production.
Therefore we propose to by-pass these unfair contractual practices and to develop a
sustainable remuneration system which would secure audiovisual authors’ remuneration for
their making available right in the digital market, taking advantage of the new technologies.
                                                                                                        6
It has to be clarified that this proposal does not interfere with the producer’s role. It aims at
organising the remuneration due to authors, once the producer has decided to make the
work available to the public in such a manner and at the time he chooses. It therefore means
that any on-demand exploitation of an audiovisual work will continue to have to be cleared
with the producer or with the making available right holder appointed by the producer or
subsequent contractor.


73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?


YES - Please explain
We support fairer contractual terms and practices, knowing that this will not solve all the
problems, in particular the remuneration issue of audiovisual authors for the exploitation of
their works. Any initiative in this field should therefore at least complement the introduction
into EU legislation of an unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their
making available right, based on the revenues generated from the online distribution of their
works.

74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the
shortcomings you identify?


Audiovisual authors governed by unfair contractual terms imposed by producers or
broadcasters in the individual negotiation of their contract. On the other hand exist European
initiatives to ensure fair remuneration of authors, consideration should be given to developing
key standards for fair and enforceable contractual terms in individual contracts, including the
prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.
One way of ensuring the enforceability of fair contractual terms would be that producers
applying for public funds for the production of films and audiovisual works should be obliged
to provide a copy of authors’ contracts among the documentation. This would be a strong
incentive for producers to better respect authors’ rights as it would become a pre-condition
for obtaining public financial support.


VII. A single EU copyright title

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a
consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for
enforcement?


NO


79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of
difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


In terms of copyright protection, the Berne Convention prohibits any formality such as
registration as a condition for the enjoyment and exercise of rights. Authors are very much
attached to this prohibition which guarantees their rights in all circumstances as far as their
creation is original and therefore deserves protection. Consequently, authors are very
reluctant to see any system based on registration as it endangers their authorship of works.
                                                                                                          7
The Commission should either undertake to revise the Berne convention or to define the
nature of the title out of the copyright sphere.



VIII. Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain
and indicate how such matters should be addressed.



We expect that creators be placed at the centre of EU copyright policy. The best way to
provide legitimacy to the copyright system is to reconnect it to creators and ensure that
creators are the first and main beneficiaries of the licence fees and remuneration paid by
users.
The current European copyright law does not provide for such a guarantee. Therefore there
is a need to rebalance European copyright policy in favour of authors and other creators as
original rightholders. This needs to be the focus and priority of any copyright reform.
