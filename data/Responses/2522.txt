The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) welcomes
the opportunity to comment on the European Commission public
consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules. In
general, SIIA notes that EUand its Member Stateshave
appropriate legal frameworks for the protection of copyright,
although there are many challenges with respect to enforcement.
Wehighlightoursupport for continued protection of computer
programs and databases. We emphasize the crucial importance of
licensing in today’s digital environment. Contractual freedom
and the non-applicability of theexhaustion limitationto
licensed works are indispensable elements to the continued
viability of this increasingly important business model.

SIIA is the principal trade association of the software and
information industries and represents over 800 companies that
develop and market software and digital content for business,
education, consumers, the Internet, and entertainment.1

A list of the more than 800 SIIA member companies may be found
at: http://www.siia.net/membership/memberlist.asp.

We have many membersestablished in the EU and who have made
significant investmentsfirms which employ many EU citizens.
SIIA’s members range from start-up firms to some of the largest
and most recognizable corporations in the world. SIIA member
companies are leading providers of, among other things:

• software publishing, graphics, and photo editing tools

• corporate database and data processing software

• financial trading and investing services, news, and
commodities exchanges

• online legal information and legal research tools

• protection against software viruses and other threats

• education software and online education services

• open source software

• and many other products and services in the digital content
industries

One of SIIA’s primary missions is toprotect the intellectual
property of member companies, and advocateforalegal and
regulatory environmentthat benefits the software and digital
content industries. Consistent with these goals, for over
thirty yearsSIIA has engaged in a comprehensive, industry-wide
campaign to advocatefor globallegal regimesthat adequately and
effectively protect the intellectual property rights of its
software and content industry members.

SIIA is notcommenting on every single question in the
consultation, preferring to focusourcomments on those questions
of greatest interest tothe software and information industries.
Our silence on a number of questions should not, however, be
interpreted as signalling an SIIA positionor lack of intereston
those matters.

Comments on selected questions follow.

EU Consultation Draft Responses.

Question 10(Two rights involved in a single act of
exploitation):Does the application of two rights to a single
act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you? (Note:the two rights refer
to the reproduction and making available rights.)

SIIA Response:

No.

There are times when a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment implicates two of a copyright owner’s
rights – the reproduction right and the making available right.
For example, when digital content is digitally transmitted from
one person to another, a copy of the original digital file will
be retained by the sender and a completely new copyof the
identical file will be created on the hard drive of the
recipient. Consequently, this one act implicates the digital
copyright owner’s reproduction right and making available
right. Even though this act may be perceived as implicating
only the making available right it is important that both
rights are considered since the transmission has created a
totally new copy that prior to the transmittal did not exist.
This is not a problem at all. Quite the opposite, this is a
necessary interpretation of the copyright law and must not be
altered. This issue arises in the context of theexhaustion
limitation.  When the person in the above example transmits a
copy to the other person,the act of transmission –standing
alone–implicatestheexhaustion limitation. However, since
theexhaustion limitationonly applies to acts involving the
distribution right and not toacts of reproduction, the fact
that a new copy now resides on the recipient’s hard drive would
not fall within the purview of theexhaustion limitationand thus,
would be considered to be an infringement, as should be the
case.  (Note:Werecognize that in the European Union, the
exhaustion limitation only applies to acts involving the
distribution right and not to acts of reproduction. For more on
the inapplicability of theexhaustion limitationin certaincaseswe
direct you to our response to question 14. Also, we recognize
that in the European Union, the distribution right only applies
to physical copies of works, although as a result of the
UsedSoft case, there is a different legal regime for software.)

Question 14 (Download to own digital content): What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale
of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per
market (type of content) concerned.

SIIA Response: It is of critical importance that we not simply
heedlessly import theexhaustion limitationinto the digital
environment without first asking whether doing so is necessary
and desirable. Trying to force today’s digital works to behave
like physical works of the past would be a step in the wrong
direction and would have a chilling effect on the development
of new business models and innovation.

It has been suggested that, as the marketplace moves toward a
born-digital model – one where there is no physical version of
the copy – theexhaustion limitationwill lose its vitality and
consequently theexhaustion limitationshould be broadened to
create a so-called digitalexhaustion limitationthat would allow
the transmission of digital copyrighted works. There are several
problems with this view.

First, to enact a so-called digitalexhaustion limitationwould
require the creation and implementation of “forward-and-delete”
technology that automatically eliminates all copies owned by the
original purchaser – no matter where such copies reside –
simultaneously upon the digital transfer of the copy by the
purchaser. No such technology exists today or in the
foreseeable future. Even if such technology were to be
available, it would be just a matter of time before it was
hacked, allowing anyone to easilycircumvent the law and
burdening copyright owners with complex, costly and impossible
problems of proof.

Second, even if such a technology were feasible in the future
this argument fails to account for the inherent differences
between physical and digital copies that dramatically affect
the function and implementation of theexhaustion limitation.For
example, physical works degrade over time, whereas digital
copies do not. Similarly, the more frequently a physical copy
is used, the quicker it will degrade, whereas the frequency of
usage has no bearing on a digital copy.

Transferring a physical copy is also significantly more
difficult than transferring the digital copy. Transferring a
digital copy is instantaneous and is unaffected by the identity
of the transferee or transferor or by the distance between them.
On the other hand, transferring a physical copy may take
significantly more time, effort and money and is highly
dependent on the identity or location of the parties. The
manner in which physical copies are transferred acts as a
natural inhibitor on the effect of re-sales on the copyright
owner’s market. For these reasons, a digitalexhaustion
limitationwould allow “used” digital copies to compete directly
with “new” digital copies on the secondary market. This is not
the case with physical goods.

Not only would it be inappropriate to incorporate a
digitalexhaustion limitationdefense into the current copyright
regime and harmful to rightsholders, but it would also harm
consumers. Consumers are enjoying unprecedented access to
copyrighted works. Today’s online marketplace offers consumers
more opportunities to access copyrighted works anytime,
anywhere than ever before. Many of the opportunities consumers
engage in the analog world made possible by thedoctrine of
exhaustion as established by the European Unionare being made
available without that exception in the digital world, as
illustrated in the following examples.

For several decades, the software industry has relied on a
licensing model for the distribution, maintenance, and updating
of its software products and services to and for its customers.
Today, licenses govern most software transactions. The software
licensing model permits a wider range of users to access and use
software. A publisher need not reduce or degrade the function of
its product in order to provide it at a reduced price
appropriate for a particular market of users. Rather, the
publisher can simply vary the rights of using it. So, for
example, a software publisher may offer a fullyfunctional
“academic” version of its product to students at a deeply
reduced price, but the rights granted do not permit use for
commercial purposes. Similarly, “OEM licenses” bundle software
with, or install software directly on, specific hardware, such
as a scanner or desktop computer, and require the software to
be used and distributed only with that hardware. Often, the
hardware manufacturer was granted a deep discount as part of
the OEM license terms. Another example is “site licenses,”
which are defined by some geographic restriction on use, such
as a specific company, area, or even department or floors of a
building.

Because software is virtually always licensed and not sold,
theexhaustion limitationshould not apply to these transactions.
Making theexhaustion limitationapplicable to these software
licenses would cause a very significant problem and would
jeopardize the future availability of discounted software to
those markets.

These examples are not limited to the software industry. The
textbook industry is rapidly moving to a licensing model for
online and digital versions of their textbooks. The new digital
textbook licensing model provides numerous benefits to students
and teachers. Digital textbooks often come with special
features, like embedded quizzes, electronic flash cards, the
ability to share notes online with fellow students and/or
embedded links to videos and articles from a professor’s
lectures. These digital texts may also allow the teacher to
monitor a student’s progress, the amount of time the student
spends reviewing the material, and the student’s performance on
the embedded quizzes and then use this information to determine
what material the student may be struggling with and develop a
personalized study plans to keep the student on the right
track. Because these textbooks are digital they can be updated
and edited much more quickly than analog texts and distributed
to users almost immediately.

These are the new generation of textbooks for a new generation
of students and teachers. The difference between traditional
textbooks and the offerings in new digital and online textbooks
is astonishing. But that’s not all that is different. The
distribution and pricing model for these textbooks is also very
different.

The average eTextbook costs significantly less than a new
version of that same print textbook. For example, the digital
version of the widely used textbook, “Biology” by Sylvia Mader
and Michael Windelspecht, publishedby McGraw-Hill Education,
costs $120. Its traditional print counterpart is priced
significantly higher at $229. Many eTextbooks are also
available for rental by students – a business model that
further lowers students’ textbook spending and has begun to
reduce the market share of the traditional used book market.
(Note: We are aware that there is a specific rental right in
the European Union that pertains to physical copies. The CJEU
has confirmed that the exhaustion limitation does not apply to
rental. We note also that the model of renting eTextbooks would
implicate the making available right, also not subject to
exhaustion. We would not favor any change in this legal
framework.)

There is one other trend that is further lowering students’
textbook spending — campuses and professors increasingly want
course materials delivered “inside” their digital classrooms so
they can ensure that all students have access to the same
materials and they can see how each student is performing. This
leads to increasing situations where the institution is the
customer. The result of all these evolving business models has
been a dramatic drop in student textbook spending from $192 in
the fall of 2008 to $138 in the spring of 2013. These business
models, and the resulting drop in student textbook spending,
might not be possible if textbook publishers were not able to
rely on licensing models and the inapplicability of
theexhaustion limitationto their digital textbooks.

Textbook publishers are able to offer their digital textbooks at
lower prices because they save on printing, shipping and
processing of returns. But another significant factor in the
reduced eTextbook price is the secondary market. Because the
publisher of a print textbook has to factor in the likelihood
that the book will be resold by the original student buyer,
either directly to another student or indirectly through a
campus bookstore offering used books, the publisher has to set
a higher price for the new print book in order to recoup its
investment. Because the new features of these digital textbooks
support a more personalized and interactive relationship between
the publisher and students and teachers than a traditional
textbook and because the publisher may continue to innovate and
update these features more quickly than the traditional print
cycle would allow, publishers license these materials. The
license allows a more flexible, nuanced relationship between
the publisher and consumers of the book. It enables teachers
and students to use only the features they need, and pay only
for what they use and for the time period for which they use
it.

In this model, license terms generally do not permit transfer to
another user, though, if there were demand, it might be
reasonable for publishers to offer a transferable license for a
higher price. It is important to consider that the publisher has
higher development and operating costs in offering rapidly
changing, personalized features, such as embedded dictionaries
or glossaries, highlighter and markup features, support for
multiple electronic reader platforms, videos, testing with
online scoring, testing analytics, and data storage so it can
track and support each user’s individual experience. To recoup
these higher costs, publishers structure their licenses to
restrict the downstream distribution of their textbooks so they
can offer digital books to each of their users at a reduced
price. If they did not restrict the resale of these books
publishers would be forced to raise their prices. By licensing
the textbooks at a lower price, students benefit from the lower
cost and increased functionality of the digital textbooks and
textbooks publishers are able to secure a reasonable return on
their investment.

As is the case with software, discussed above, theexhaustion
limitationshould not apply to these licensed digital textbooks
as doing so would jeopardize the future availability of these
materials.

If a consumer obtained a set of rights to a copyrighted work
under license, and the consumer resells the work and asserts
theexhaustion limitation, the focus of theanalysis should be on
the terms and conditions of the agreement itself. If there is an
agreement between the copyright owner or its agent and the
consumer and that agreement makes it clear that a license is
being granted (or the copyright owner otherwise reserves title)
and that the license contains certain restrictions on transfer
and use that are not usually present with ownership, the
transaction should be construed as a license and theexhaustion
limitationshould be inapplicable to the transaction.
SIIAopposesrestricting contractual rights which would have the
effect of undermining the success of the licensing model.For
example, software licensors typically limit their conveyance of
rights to a licensee in a number of ways: by location of use,
term of use, type of user, field of use (academic,
non-commercial), use with certain hardware (“OEM”),
transferability, and reverse engineering, to name just a few.
In contrast to a licensee, a purchaser who becomes an “owner,”
would have no such limits by contract and could use the copy of
software however he/she wanted consistent with applicable laws,
statutes, ordinances, etc.

While consideration of the types of restrictions that a licensor
places on transfer and use within the agreement is important, it
is not necessary or appropriate to also consider the types of
restrictions that a licensor does not place on transfer and
use. It should not be necessary that a license include certain
terms to avoid conveyance of ownership, such as multiple
payments or return of a worthless plastic CD. It is the code,
content and associated rights that are valuable, not the
vehicle of delivery or conveyance (whether CD, DVD, or data
transmissions on the Internet). While a licensor theoretically
could require destruction of the disc or erasing the data file,
the transaction costs to enforce that restriction would in many
cases dwarf the license fee and serve to do nothing more than
inconvenience the customer, and thus it makes no sense to
penalize licensors that omit such a requirement.

Consumers will be able to take advantage of new technologies and
business models only to the extent that the laws do not inhibit
the creation and use of new technologies and business models.
If the law creates undue burdens on providers, the result will
be increased transactional costs, without producing any
corresponding tangible benefits to users, and in the end, both
the providers and the users’ interests will be harmed. This is
especially true where the legal requirement on the provider is
one that the user cares little about or has the ability to
secure in the absence of any legal requirement.

If undue restrictions are placed on either the ability of
publishers to license or the manner in which publishers license
it will be more challenging for publishers to recoup the
investment they have made to develop new products and update
existing ones and to widely distribute their products and
services to the public in the manner that consumers enjoy
today. This is especially true with mass market click-through
agreements and products offered through the cloud. Certain
informational products can only be distributed through the use
of license terms and conditions. If these terms could not be
enforced, these products may not be distributed, and in some
cases, the incentive to create certain products may have been
reduced so significantly that these new products would never be
created.

The economic foundations of the software and information
industries depend upon a licensing business model. “Overriding”
such licenses would have far-reaching, adverse effects on
everything from the availability of educational software and
content, to warranties and support services, to the development
of new products. It is therefore essential that the
basicprinciple of freedom of contract be recognized and
preserved by any legislation. Nothing in the law should
restrict the rights of parties to enter freely into licenses or
any other contracts with respect to the use of copyrighted
works. This is more important now than ever before because in
an increasingly digital knowledge economy it is almost certain
that software and information publishers will make their
products and services available subject to critical contractual
terms that are essential to ensuring the widespread access to
innovative new digital products and services.

Question 15(Registration of works and other subject
matter):Would the creation of a registration system at EU level
help in the identification and licensing of works and other
subject matter?

SIIA Response:

Yes.

Markets operate most efficiently when buyers and sellers can
easily find one another. Yet the current copyright system does
little to promote this concept. There are benefits to copyright
registration that provide some incentive for copyright owners to
accurately and timely register their copyrighted works. However,
because registration is not mandatory (as necessitated by
international norms, such as the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works;we are not advocating
for mandatory registration though – SIIA considers voluntary
registration to be the correct approach) and creation of
copyrighted works in the digital age is so easy, a great many
copyrighted works are not registered,often making it extremely
difficult to identify, locate and contactcopyright owners.

This problem is exacerbated due to the failure to
recordtransfers of ownership incopyrighted works.Thisof course
undermines the accuracy of any recordation systems currently in
existence. Moreover, often even when the copyright owner has
timely and correctly registered his work and recorded any
transfer of the work,it is possible that a reasonable and
thorough search of catalogs and records will not reveal the
work. For example, a work may be difficult or impossible to
find if it was registered under a different title or as part
ofa larger work. Also, because registration records may not be
updated in a timely manner, any search for a recently created
copyrighted work may be unsuccessful.

For these reasons SIIA supportsthecreation of an improved
copyright infrastructureon a voluntary basisthat enhances the
ability of potential licensees and licensors of copyrighted
works to find one another for the purposes of negotiating
licensing agreements. EU law should more effectively promote
the creation of new tools, technologies, databases, systems and
processes for identifyingand locating copyright owners on a
voluntary basis.The SIIA also suggests consideration of a tax
credit to businesses that create new tools for identifying and
locating copyright owners. The provision of financial
assistance tosmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that
create new copyright owner identification and location tools
should also be considered.

Question17(Registration of works and other subject matter):What
incentives for registration by rightsholders could be
envisaged?

SIIA Response:SIIA is not sure what incentives would be
appropriate in the EU context. Should new mechanisms be
considered, we offer the following suggestions.

Transfer of Ownership Database: An easily searchable database
designed to facilitate the tracking of information that
identifies successors in interest whenever changes in copyright
ownership occur with respect to copyrighted works, for example
due to corporate mergers, acquisitions or dissolutions,
inheritance, bankruptcy or divorce, other transfer of
ownership.

Owner Identification and Location Database: A database that
tracks the identification and location of copyright owners. The
database would document changes in information regarding the
identity and location of the copyright owner, such as name
change due to marriage, divorce or otherwise, newly revealed
attributions or authorship (e.g., due to ownership originally
being misattributed, anonymous or pseudonymous) and change in
residence.

These databases could be automated to enable copyright owners to
easily update their records online. The operators of these
databases could also push notifications to copyright owners to
remind them to update their records at certain intervals or
when inaccurate information in the database is discovered –
much like what domain name registrars do under the ICANN2013
Registrar Accreditation Agreement.2

See2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement
athttp://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/raa/approved-with-specs-27jun13-en.htm(requiring
domain name registrars toconduct an investigationupon receipt of
a complaint filed relating to inaccurate WHOIS contact
informationand,ifthe registrardetermines that the WHOIS contact
information is inaccurate it must take steps to correct the
inaccuracy).

While submission of information to these databases would be
strictly voluntary, strong incentives should be created to
prompt copyright owners to keep their records up to date.We
note that establishing databases as described above could well
be a costly proposition. Tax credits and other mechanisms
should be explored if the idea is to incentivize rightsholders
to establish databases.

Because rights information and licensing are global in nature,we
believe that the Commissionshould engage in discussions with
other countries through multilateral and bilateral discussions
and through international bodies, such as WIPO, to determine
how other countries are addressing online licensing database
issuesto ensurethat everybody’seffortsare compatible and
interoperable.

Question19(How to improve the use and interoperability of
identifiers):What should be the role of the EU in promoting the
adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting
the development and interoperability of right ownership and
permissions databases?

SIIA Response:SIIA believes that the EU should promote
market-based solutions in encouraging the adoption of
identifiers in the content sector and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases. Tax credits for database creators might
be an option. Minimum or increaseddamages for copyright owners
that avail themselves of identifiers and permissions databases
might also incentivize owners to establish permissions
databases.We note also that in large measure, the identifier
issues is really a standards-development matter. SIIA considers
that identifier solutions must be found with a view to
international operability, especially for digital works. The
full involvement ofall relevantindustry stakeholdersis also
indispensable.

Question 20 (Term of protection):Are the current terms of
copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

SIIA Response:Without espousing any view on what is or is not an
appropriate term of copyright protection, we strongly believe
that whatever termis provided under a country’s or region’s
copyright law, that the term should apply universally to all
copyrighted works, without regard to or discriminating based on
the type of copyrighted work, the format (analog, digital or
other) of the copyrighted work or other characteristics of the
work or how or whether it is made available to the public.

Question 55 (Text mining): If your view is that a legislative
solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?

SIIA Response: We have noviewas to whether legislation is needed
or appropriate here. However, if the Commission determines that
legislation is necessary in the area of text mining we urge the
Commission to proceed extremely cautiously. Text mining, data
mining and data analytics is adynamicindustry. We are concerned
that any legislation in this areais premature in the absence of
a well defined problem andcould have detrimental effectson the
discovery of knowledge that stands to benefit society as a
whole.

In the event that legislation is considered by the Commission,
then we urge that a distinction be made between public domain
data and data that is not in the public domain or is protected
behind firewalls or other types of anti-circumvention
technology.  With public domain data, text mining should be
permittedif in accordwith the law.   Where data is protected or
proprietary, the authority of the data provider should be
necessary and any circumvention of that protection should be
viewed as a violation of the law.   (Note: Protection does not
necessarily have to come through copyright law.)   Where access
to the data is obtained by a license between the data provider
and the data user, which contains use restrictions, any
restrictions in that license on systematic copying techniques
or text mining should be respected.  Where the law permits text
mining, the text miner is not obliged to seek permission to
perform the mining, but is obliged to abide by any licensing
terms and conditions prohibiting mining.

Question 72(Fair remunerationof authors and performers):What is
the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure
that you receive an adequate remuneration for the existing
exploitation of your works and performances?

SIIA Response: This is a complex question, particularly given
the fact that the European Union has 28 members with differing
legislation and practices. For example, the Commission itself
notes in Chapter V that Member States have had broad leeway in
determining who owns rights when a work is created in the
context of an employment contract. We note that particularly in
the software sector in Europe, employment contracts have been a
successful mechanism in the creation and dissemination of new
software.

Question 73 (Fair remuneration for authors and performers): Is
there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

SIIA Response:

No.

See the response to question 14.

Question 75(Respect for rights):Should the civil enforcement
system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Yes.

SIIA Response:SIIA considers that, yes, the civil enforcement
system in the EU could be rendered more efficient, although we
are not persuaded that legislative change is needed at the EU
level.We do notbelieve that Directive 2004/48/EE should
necessarily be amended. Our view is that many Member States
have made goodeffortsto transpose the Directive in ways which
allowrightsholders to make use of the Directive in a practical
sense. However, we know that Article 8 of the Directive has
been interpreted differently in different Member States.For
example, Spain has interpreted the Directive’s Article 8 on the
“right of information” to require commercial scaleof
infringementon the part of both the intermediary and the
intermediary’s customer. The Directive does not, however,
require this dual scale commercial requirement – it only
requires the intermediary to be engaged on a commercial scale.
We think that the Commission’s 2012-2013 public consultation on
the functioning of the Directive was a worthwhile initiative.
SIIA encourages the Commission to review theinformation
provided through the lens of determining which Member States
have transposed the Directive most successfully with a view to
encouraging all Member States to adopt similar regimes.

There needs to be a combination of strong criminal and civil
enforcement mechanisms to ensure respect for copyright. This is
particularly important in the context of the Internet. The sheer
volume of infringements occurring over the Internet require
timely notice and takedown procedures, consistent with
appropriate safeguards for intermediaries, for infringing
content. Respect for contracts, particularly in the context of
licensing, is especially important for the software and
information industries. Besides appropriate laws and active
enforcement, the European Union might also
considerfurtherpromotion ofvoluntary arrangements among
stakeholders. Such arrangements can complement, but not
substitute for, good law and enforcement. For example, SIIA has
supported the creation of payment processor voluntary best
practices to cut off payments to websites dealing in infringing
materials.

Question 76(Respect for rights):In particular, is the current
framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries (such as Internet Service providers,advertising
brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars,
etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

SIIA Response:There is a different level of intermediary
involvement in different EU Member States in inhibiting online
copyright infringementswith a commercial purpose. Based on
SIIA’s experience in the United States, there are two
essential factors in getting the involvement the Commission
refers to. First,a liability regime that incentivizes
intermediaries to play a role. Appropriate limitations on
liability (safe harbors)are needed in orderfor online companies
to thrive and incentivize them totake meaningful steps to
address, for example,Intellectual Property
Infringements.Second,aliability regime that incentivizes
intermediaries to actvoluntarily.SIIA hasparticipated in the
creation of a set of voluntary best practices whereby five
major payment processors – Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
Discover, and PayPal – agreed to come together and work with
rightsholders to establish practical and timely mechanisms to
terminate payments to infringing websites.(Note: The comment
does notmean that SIIA considers that the Enforcement Directive
requires modification.)
