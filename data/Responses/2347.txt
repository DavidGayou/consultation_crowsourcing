     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of



16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               11
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.


22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?

problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The provision of a hyperlink leading to copyrighted content should not be treated as “making
available” or otherwise communicating that content to the public. A contrary rule, making the
provision of hyperlinks subject to rightholder authorization, would severely damage the
ability of the World Wide Web to continue to serve as a uniquely rich forum for free
expression and the robust exchange of information.
The act of linking does not make content available – it merely informs users about content
that is already available online. A link is best understood as a pointer or navigation tool. It
adds no new copyrighted material to the body of what can be found online, just as maps or
street signs add no new locations to the physical environment they help travelers to navigate.
Indeed, the actual availability of the copyrighted content to which a link may point is entirely
independent of the link: the content can remain available even if the link is removed, or the
content can cease to be available (because the original poster has removed it) while the link
pointing to the content’s former location remains online.

                                                                                                         13
Reflecting this reality, the party who is treated as making content “available to the public”
within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC should be the one who uploads the
content to an Internet-connected server that allows public access and responds to requests.
The act of providing hyperlinks to content that has been uploaded by others should not be
treated as requiring rightholder authorization.
A contrary legal approach, under which linking to content could be deemed to constitute
making that content available to the public, would jeopardize the widespread practice of
hyperlinking and ultimately the utility of the Web. People and entities link to websites and
materials they judge to be useful, informative, funny, or otherwise noteworthy. But the linkers
generally lack any ability to verify the copyright status of those websites or materials. They
simply do not know whether the unaffiliated websites to which they link truly own or have
acquired the rights to the content they feature. If linkers faced potential legal responsibility for
the copyright transgressions of all the sites they linked to, then each decision to add a new
link would carry with it a new area of legal exposure and risk. Websites, bloggers, and all
other users of the Web would have a strong incentive to sharply curtail their linking.
That would greatly undermine the usefulness of the Web. Hyperlinks are central to the Web’s
nature; they are what enable users to navigate and discover a virtually endless universe of
websites and content, based on what other people and entities have identified as relevant,
noteworthy, interesting, or funny. Hyperlinks enable a rich form of free expression, giving
depth and context to online commentary and debate. They also promote competition and
diversity of expression, by enabling formerly little-known speakers or websites to “go viral”
and become popular quickly. But if linking carried liability risk, few Internet users would be
willing to take the risk of linking to any but the most trusted and well-known sites. Any legal
rule that discourages the practice of hyperlinking would constrain the Web’s ability to serve
as a robust forum for free expression and competition.
As the Commission’s Public Consultation questionnaire notes, however, EU law is not clear
on this crucial legal point; Directive 2001/29/EC does not specify precisely what acts
constitute “making available,” and there are several cases relating to hyperlinking pending
before the CJEU.
Moreover, some courts have suggested that if the provision of hyperlinks substantially and
intentionally increases the size of the public accessing the copyrighted content, then the
linking may constitute communication to the public. The problem with this line of reasoning
is that hyperlinks always increase the audience of the content to which they link. Any link
offered in a publicly read blog, website, or online news source has the effect of referring a
new public to the linked content. Just as important, linkers can direct a new audience to online
content only if the persons who uploaded the content have chosen to allow uncontrolled
access to it. There are ample technical tools for limiting online access to authorized persons
(such as paid subscribers). If content owners instead choose to upload content to publicly
available websites with no form of access control, courts should not treat the linkers as having
made the content available. And where other parties upload content to publicly available
websites without authorization from the content owners, it is those parties who should be
deemed to have violated the making available right.
Nor should the provision of embedded links be treated differently from regular hyperlinks.
There is no reason why the precise manner in which linked content is displayed – on a
separate website, or in a window on the website that provided the link – should have any
bearing on the legal question of who made the content available. Providers of embedded links,
just like providers of regular hyperlinks, generally have no way to assess the legal status of
the online content to which they wish to link. Treating embedded linkers as the persons who

                                                                                                 14
make the content available would sharply discourage embedded linking, which has become a
significant communicative aspect of the online medium. The legal framework should not
needlessly constrain the expressive options and features of online communication.
An appropriate, EU-wide legal rule would establish that the provision of hyperlinks to
copyrighted content does not require rightholder authorization.
Such a rule need not excuse truly culpable behavior. For example, in cases where linking is
deliberately aimed at promoting and profiting from large-scale infringement, it may be
appropriate to consider some form of secondary liability – that is, liability for intentionally
and systematically assisting or enabling infringement. But any such liability would need to be
clearly premised on demonstrable bad intent, whereas the right of communicating or making
available to the public does not depend on intent at all. The fact that there may be occasional
instances in which linking activities may seem far from innocent is no justification for the
legal framework to confuse the mere act of linking with the act of making content available in
the first place.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
The principle that temporary reproductions associated with viewing webpages should not
require rightholder authorization is essential to the daily activities of Internet users
everywhere.
Browsing the Web requires the temporary reproduction of text, images, and other content that
websites make available. Because these reproductions are incidental byproducts of the
technological process of viewing a website, they should fall squarely within the exception set
forth in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
Requiring rightholder authorization for website browsing would fundamentally disrupt the
ability of Internet users to take advantage of the wealth of information that the Web offers.
Internet users have no way to evaluate whether the websites they want to visit have lawfully
acquired the rights to the content posted there. Thus, even if Internet users could assume that
each website operator authorizes website visitors to make temporary reproductions of the
content found there, users would always face the possibility that the mere act of visiting a
website would make them liable for copyright infringement. All it would take would be the
failure of a website (whether intentionally or not) to acquire the rights to an image or article it
posts, and its visitors could be deemed to infringe the reproduction right.
This is not a tenable result. One of the great virtues of the Web is that it gives users wide
latitude to sample and serendipitously explore information, opinions, and ideas from a nearly
infinite range of sources. This freedom to read and research widely and casually cannot exist
if every visit to every website exposes the reader to unknown legal responsibilities and risks.
For their part, website operators, as well as bloggers and Internet speakers of all stripes,
expect and hope that the material they post will be widely viewed. Speakers are not well

                                                                                                15
served by a legal regime that discourages Internet users from browsing widely. And where
website operators do wish to limit their audience, they have ample technological tools for
imposing restrictions such as paywalls and limiting access to authorized users. They do not
need to rely on copyright law for this.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

 NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Resale markets for digital content could generate significant benefits. There are also
significant questions that would need to be worked out regarding their appropriate scope,
operations, and safeguards against abuse. Providing a legal framework for the resale of
previously purchased digital content would be useful and important, because it would enable
innovators to begin the work of developing the systems and technologies that could facilitate
and operationalize an appropriate digital resale market. Without a stable legal framework,
companies are unlikely to invest in exploring “forward and delete” or other creative solutions,
to make digital resale markets a workable reality.

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              16
To be clear, some of today’s digital content distribution models do not lend themselves to
resale. Where consumers buy access to large libraries of content – for example, via cloud-
based subscription services such as Spotify or Netflix – the consumer may not acquire an
ownership interest that is properly subject to resale. A legal framework may need to
distinguish those scenarios where resale rights should apply from those where they should
not.
But failing to provide any legal framework for digital resale would mean that, as commerce in
copyrighted works increasingly goes all-digital, the substantial benefits of resale markets
would be lost. That would be an unfortunate result. In the market for physical goods, online
resale markets, far from being a minor economic phenomenon, have become a thriving and
durable part of the consumer economy. For creative works in particular, resale markets offer a
number of distinct benefits:
•     They provide lower-priced options for consumers.
•     They spur innovation in the marketplace. Exhaustion and the possibility of resale
      enables third parties to develop new distribution models (such as, for example, video
      rental) that generate new options for consumers and prompt rightholders to compete
      more effectively.
•     They help preserve access and availability. If the original distributor ceases to distribute
      a work – due to commercial decisions, going out of business, or for any other reason –
      resale markets allow interested parties to find alternative sources for obtaining copies of
      the work. This function has flourished online thanks to new tools that make it practical
      to locate and obtain even obscure, rare, or far-flung copies of works.
•     They help limit the amount of control rightholders can exercise over how downstream
      users engage with works, because they prevent rightholders from having privity of
      contract with all downstream users or purchasers. This means more freedom for users
      and more full enjoyment of copyrighted works. For example, rightholders cannot force
      e-book purchasers to agree to read chapters in a specific order, or prohibit purchasers of
      artworks from framing or mounting them as they see fit.
•     They protect privacy by making it impossible for rightholders to track the identities of
      all consumers who have obtained copies of their works. The “right to read
      anonymously” is protected by the ability to obtain works via resale.
•     They reduce consumer lock-in with respect to technology platforms. For example, users
      might have been more reluctant to upgrade to CDs if they were not allowed to resell
      their vinyl records and thus recoup some of their investment in earlier technology.
Developing a suitable legal framework could help encourage the innovation necessary to
ensure that these various benefits are not sacrificed as content delivery goes digital.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                     17
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide

30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
The phrasing of the question assumes that existing terms of protection are appropriate. It is
worth recalling the objectives for which copyright protection terms were originally
introduced. The goal was to create incentives for creative and intellectual production by
granting the creator a temporary monopoly on the work and exclusive exploitation rights.
When first introduced in the early 18th century, the copyright term was 14 years with option
to renew. Although copyright protection involves considerations other than provision of
economic incentives, it is also clear that protection terms should ideally be only long enough
to provide an optimal level of incentives. Monopoly ownership involves cost to society as a
whole, and the cost should not outweigh the benefits.
After a series of extensions, most of them retroactive, terms of protection in Europe and other
parts of the world now exceed 70 years (+ life of the author).

As late as 2011 (http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/term-protection/index_en.htm)
the European Union adopted legislation to extend the term of protection for performers and
sound recordings from 50 to 70 years. The extension was enacted retroactively.
The rationale and arguments for repeated term extensions have been carefully examined by
researchers and academics. In 2006, the UK Government undertook an extensive and
thorough review of copyright and IP legislation – known as the ‘Gowers Review’
(http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-
treasury.gov.uk/d/pbr06_gowers_report_755.pdf). The conclusions from this review – and
other economic analyses – are quite unambiguous and unequivocal. The long terms of
protection in force in Europe today cannot be justified based on their potential to stimulate
creative production, and they impose overall economic loss to European societies. A further
review of IP legislation was completed by the UK Intellectual Property Office in 2011 (the
Hargreaves Review, http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf) confirmed these
conclusions.
The transition to the digital environment increases the potential negative impact of excessive
terms of protection. New technologies are expanding the pool of creators, empowering
creative output by citizens and entities outside the traditional media and entertainment
industries. Digitization offers new flexibility to combine, incorporate, and interact with
creative works in useful and entertaining ways. These trends mean that the opportunities for
society to use and benefit from a robust public domain of works not protected by copyright
are greater than ever before.
Overlong copyright terms unduly constrain the public domain without meaningfully
increasing incentives to create new works, and thus represent poor public policy. On this
basis it is clear that a review of European copyright legislation should under no circumstances
include proposals to extend protection terms even further. On the contrary, there are powerful
arguments for proposing a significant shortening of terms of protection. Some researchers
have presented ideas and proposals for how such reform could be brought forward whilst
respecting                obligations          under             international          treaties
(http://www.cippm.org.uk/publications/Kretschmer-term-reversion.pdf). Such innovative
approaches should be part of the European Commission’s reflections.



 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal


36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                            20
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
See answer to question 22.

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           21
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The Internet is a borderless platform for communication that by its very nature continually
raises novel questions relating to copyright. Communication on the Internet necessarily
involves copying – on servers, router buffers, and individual computers, etc. Thus, services
ranging from user-generated content sites to distance education systems to search engines can
implicate copyright, even where their impact on creators’ and rightholders’ reputations and
the market for their works is minimal. In the Internet environment, limitations and exceptions
are therefore not insubstantial “extras” added onto copyright's framework of rights and
incentives for largely extraneous, non-economic reasons; they are essential.
Because of how important exceptions can be, the harmonising of rights and licensing alone is
not sufficient to facilitate the development of a single European market for Internet-based
services and technologies. Where a particular service relies on one or more exceptions in
order to operate, its ability to offer services across jurisdictions will be impeded by
differences in the availability of exceptions from one Member State to the next. Promoting the
growth of the European single market thus requires both rights and protections for
rightholders and harmonised imitations and exceptions to those rights.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
As discussed below, there is a need for a more flexible limitation or exception that can
accommodate future technology innovations that cannot be anticipated today.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES – Please explain why
Limitations and exceptions facilitate much more than criticism, teaching, and creative re-uses
of works. They are also crucial to technological innovation and the development of Internet-
based services in Europe. A flexible approach that creates space for new uses and
technologies to improve accessibility of creative works is essential for spurring such
development, identified as a flagship goal of the Europe 2020 Strategy in the Digital Agenda
for Europe.
By definition, the currency of innovation is new ideas. On the Internet, where copying is
commonplace and any new service can raise unpredictable questions related to the application
of copyright, a lack of flexibility will be obstacle to innovation. No matter how
comprehensive a static list of exceptions appears at the time it is written into law, there will be
no way for legislators to predict all future uses and applications, especially in a sector that is
developing and evolving so quickly. A static list of exceptions removes any incentive for
entrepreneurs and developers to try anything that doesn’t appear on the list. This is true even


                                                                                                22
of uses that pose no threat to the market for protected works, but which nonetheless implicate
the strict letter of copyright law because they involve some measure of copying.
The US fair use doctrine is replete with examples of the benefits of a flexible approach. In a
1984 case observers have called “the legal foundation of the digital age,” fair use’s flexibility
created the space for private non-commercial copying that allowed the VCR to remain on the
market. The US growth in the technology sector over the past 30 years is attributable in no
small part to this decision. In subsequent cases, the doctrine has explicitly enabled search
engines and mass digitization and indexing projects. Without fair use’s flexible approach to
novel applications of technology, these innovations and countless others would not have taken
hold in the US and succeeded to anywhere near the degree they have.
Some European courts, seeming to recognize the value in a flexible approach, have attempted
to inject a modicum of flexibility into the current EU framework, for example by engaging in
rights-balancing analysis or applying the safe harbors of the E-Commerce Directive. But these
approaches are likely to be inconsistent and incomplete, and will not solve the problems of
cross-border inconsistency discussed above. An EU-level review of copyright presents the
opportunity to establish a more harmonized approach to flexibility that will help spur the
development of Europe’s digital economy.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
Some form of built-in flexibility, in the form of a concrete and durable legal provision, is
important to technology innovation and the growth of Europe’s digital economy. A company
considering launching an innovative technology or service – and the investors considering
backing such a company – must be able to make a reasonable assessment of the legal viability
of its proposed project under existing legal provisions. In fast-moving technology markets, it
is not sufficient to force innovators to wait for periodic revisions of the directives or
interpretations by the Commission. If European innovators are forced to rely on such ad hoc
proceedings in order to get permission to go ahead, the European technology sector will face a
perpetual disadvantage.

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective

Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

B.      Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from

45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that

55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
A flexible copyright exception targeted at text and data mining could remove obstacles to
potentially beneficial applications of these practices. As the Commission notes, the copying
of text and data sets required for mining may not qualify for the temporary copying exception.
Nonetheless, there are likely to be non-consumptive mining activities that do not prejudice the
rights or economic interests of authors or rights holders, for which copyright should therefore
not be an obstacle. For example, linguistic and lexicographic research on textual works
would typically have no impact on traditional markets for copyrighted works. Other mining
activities may simply involve the extraction and analysis of facts, which are not covered by
copyright. The literal acts of copying required to carry out activities irrelevant to copyright
protection should not in such cases trigger liability.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users

                                                                                            33
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

 IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
 YES – Please explain
For several years, the European institutions, Member State governments and courts have
wrestled with the problems associated with the concept of fair compensation for private
copying in Directive 2001/29/EC. The difficulty in applying the Directive is illustrated by the
large number of court cases that come before the Court of Justice of the EU on this matter.
There is little consistency in Member States’ application of the Directive on these issues,
which gives rise to serious Single Market problems. These problems have been well

   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on

documented over the past decade, not least by the Commission                                           itself
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/levy_reform/index_en.htm).
A fundamental problem is that the copyright levies system was designed for an environment
where there were few legitimate sources of copyrighted audio/video/written content, and the
few types of equipment that could be used to make copies, were dedicated to one type of
recording/copying. For example, audio tapes were the medium for making copies of music
and video tapes were the medium for recording broadcast TV.
In today’s environment, digital devices from PCs to smartphones store and hold any type of
content, much of it professional or personal without any relevance for compensation, and
content in digital form is available from a myriad of sources. It is therefore virtually
impossible to estimate with any precision the value of the storage of copyrighted digital
content on any on class of device, let alone by any particular user. In addition, the rapid shift
in consumption of entertainment content from purchases of physical items (which can then in
some cases be legally copied for private use, unless fitted with technical protection measures),
to streaming and rental of works – subject to direct licensing and accounting – means that the
concept of a private copy is often not relevant. In addition, consumers and businesses now use
remote (cloud) storage, and in this scenario, they do not themselves own the storage medium.
The copyright levies systems operated across many European countries are fundamentally not
well-suited to today’s digital environment, and they can be seen to be a rather arbitrary tax on
the technologies that Europe needs to improve competitiveness, innovation, commerce, and
education.
There is no question that the current state of affairs creates legal and economic uncertainty
both for rightholders, consumers, and the manufacturers of products that may or may not be
subject to copyright levies in one or some or no EU Member States. A more harmonized,
consistent, transparent, and efficient system would surely be to the advantage of all
stakeholders.
The Commission has consulted with stakeholders repeatedly and conducted several reviews to
ensure a better level of consistency in application across the EU. The latest instalment was the
mediation undertaken by Antonio Vitorino, former Member of the European Commission for
Justice and Home Affairs. Mr. Vitorino delivered his recommendations in January 2013
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-
recommendations_en.pdf).
Mr. Vitorino brought forward several significant and sensible ideas, which should form the
basis for the Commissions future policy reform.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
 NO – Please explain
The copyright system should not discourage private copying that merely enables or enhances
an end user’s private use and enjoyment of content lawfully acquired via licensed services.
Such private copying ultimately benefits rightholders as well as end users. It increases the
utility and hence the appeal, value and demand for licensed content, which translates into
increased revenues for content providers. As no harm is occurring to the rightholder, no
59
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          37
justification for additional compensation arises. Any concerns over private copying from
subscription services that does not result in users’ obtaining ownership of particular copies of
digital content would be best addressed in the licenses for the service in question, not through
levying.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

 NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

CDT does not engage in such cross-border transactions. However, the subject has been
addressed by Mr. Vitorino in his report.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 VI.        Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?


For purposes of responding to this question, we will distinguish between Internet
intermediaries (companies that directly enable online communication, such as content hosts
and “mere conduit” access providers) and financial intermediaries (companies that enable the
business or financial arrangements for online communication, such as advertising networks
and payment platforms).


Internet Intermediaries
The legal framework should not be altered to require or pressure Internet intermediaries such
as content hosts and Internet access providers to play an increased role in online copyright
enforcement. The existing framework offers sufficiently powerful tools to combat
infringement, and is at times already in tension with important provisions of the E-Commerce
Directive that are essential to maintaining the Internet as a robust platform for innovation,
European economic development, and free expression.
Policies protecting intermediaries from liability or gatekeeping responsibilities – as embodied
in Articles 12-15 of the E-Commerce Directive – have been a tremendous success, driving
investment in innovative services and communications networks. Society benefits from these
empowering technologies in the form of increased opportunities for expression, access to
information, collaboration, civic engagement, and economic growth. (CDT discussed these
benefits in a 2012 paper, https://www.cdt.org/paper/shielding-messengers-protecting-
platforms-expression-and-innovation) In contrast, mandating new policing obligations would
create new barriers to innovation and competition in European communications offerings and
force existing service providers to focus on gatekeeping and surveillance functions instead of
investing in valuable new services.


At the same time, the existing enforcement framework, including the notice-and-action
system of the ECD, offers strong and expedient tools to combat infringement. In addition to
lawsuits, rightholders can demand that Internet intermediaries remove or disable access to

                                                                                            41
infringing material without pursuing legal action – indeed without any court oversight at all.
The structure of the liability protection offered by the ECD creates strong incentives for
intermediaries to comply with takedown requests. And the scale of many intermediaries’
operations and the volume of notices they receive mean they have little opportunity to
scrutinize notices, which means that in most cases notices are quickly honored – even those
that may not be justified.
In addition, it is already possible under the existing framework for courts to issue injunctions
against intermediaries whose services are used for proven infringement. Some national courts
are indeed already moving in this direction, having issued blocking injunctions against access
providers              (e.g.,          http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/379.html,
http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=&lgrec=en&nat=or&oqp=&dates=&lg=&language=e
n&jur=C%2CT%2CF&cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%2
52C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&num=C
-314%252F12&td=ALL&pcs=Oor&avg=&page=1&mat=or&jge=&for=&cid=297210).
Such injunctions already raise serious concerns regarding the protection of fundamental
rights. Given these concerns, the Commission should avoid any action that would invite or
require greater policing responsibilities by Internet intermediaries.
First, blocking injunctions are in direct tension with Article 15 of the ECD, which expressly
prohibits Member States from obligating intermediaries to monitor the information they
transmit or store or to seek out indications of illegal activity. This provision is essential to the
ability of intermediaries to offer robust online services without ongoing, broad-based
surveillance features that would jeopardize user privacy and can be expensive if not entirely
impractical to operate at Internet scale. Yet to implement even a targeted blocking order, an
access provider must monitor all traffic in order to ferret out requests for the blocked site. It is
therefore impossible to reconcile blocking orders with the prohibition on general monitoring
obligations.     The CJEU has overturned content-filtering mandates on Internet access
providers and social-networking sites on the basis of Article 15. See SABAM v. Scarlet, ECJ
C-70/10           and          SABAM            v.          Netlog,         ECJ          C-360/10
(http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=115202&pageIndex=0&do
clang=EN&mode=doc&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=996022).
In addition, blocking by access providers can be dramatically overbroad, thus posing serious
risk to free expression and raising questions of proportionality. Many blocking methods,
including IP-address and domain-name blocking, can inadvertently block more than just the
intended site. Moreover, blocking is a very blunt instrument. Rather than enabling targeted
action against specific infringing content, it targets entire platforms, which may well contain a
mix of lawful and infringing content. Issuing blocking orders for such platforms – even those
that may have come to be commonly used for infringement – can impair the ability of some
users to access lawful expressive material. Domain-name blocking poses additional risks to
the       security      and      stability       of      the       domain      name       system
(http://domainincite.com/docs/PROTECT-IP-Technical-Whitepaper-Final.pdf).


Indeed, in an advisory opinion in an Internet-blocking case currently pending before the
CJEU, Advocate General Pedro Cruz Villalon concluded that injunctions ordering blocking
by access providers require a careful balancing of fundamental rights, including the access
provider’s freedom to operate its business and its customers’ free expression rights
(http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=144944&pageIndex=0&do
clang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=330161). Moreover, he found that
general injunctions to stop infringement, without specifying the precise steps to be taken, are
                                                                                                 42
incompatible with the balancing of fundamental rights required. For more specific injunctions,
the Advocate General concluded that “it is for the national courts to balance, in each
particular case, taking into account all relevant circumstances, the fundamental rights of the
parties concerned and to ensure a fair balance between those fundamental rights.” Notably,
the Dutch Court of Appeals recently overturned court-ordered blocking of The Pirate Bay,
holding the because the measures ordered were easily circumvented and ineffective at
stopping             infringement,            they           were            disproportionate
(http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:GHDHA:2014:88).
Internet intermediaries are simply not suited to conducting a full analysis and balancing of
fundamental rights on their own, without guidance from courts. Thus, we believe it would be
unwise for the EU to mandate or press for a more active role for Internet intermediaries that
may limit or eliminate court oversight.


Financial Intermediaries
Approaches to copyright enforcement focused on financial intermediaries such as advertising
networks and payment processors could be preferable in some respects to measures relying on
Internet intermediaries, but would also carry significant risks for free expression and online
innovation.
If a criminal website cannot make money – either through payments from users or from
advertisers – then it likely cannot operate at a substantial scale. Moreover, financial blockades
are likely to be more difficult to circumvent than blocking or filtering by Internet
intermediaries.
Focusing on the business relationships that enable sites to profit from illegal activity may
avoid some of the negative side effects of focusing on the communications infrastructure. For
example, “follow the money” remedies do not interfere with the Internet’s addressing system
or other technical architecture, and therefore can avoid unintended technical consequences
such as undermining cybersecurity or splintering the global Internet.
If applied too broadly, however, even the threat of financial sanctions could pose serious risk
for online free expression and the operation of legitimate platforms and businesses. The
impact of cutting off a website operator’s revenue can be severe. For example, in October
2011, Wikileaks announced that it was suspending all publishing because of the financial
blockade against it, illuminating the significant speech implications of allowing financial
intermediaries to decide such difficult questions. The threat of financial cutoff could also
prompt substantial self-censorship. For example, for a brief time in 2012, PayPal threatened to
cut off its services to an e-book platform unless it removed books with certain categories of
sexual content. This would have forced the platform and its authors to censor lawful content
in order to avoid losing access to an important sales channel. PayPal wisely changed course,
but the episode demonstrates that threatening websites and online services with private
financial sanctions based on their users’ behavior can chill online speech in much the same
way as threatening to impose liability for it.
These risks would need to be carefully addressed as a part of initiatives to enlist financial
intermediaries to take action against infringing content. At a minimum, there would need to
be precise standards to ensure that financial sanctions were used only against true bad actors
in egregious and straightforward cases, while carefully avoiding more complicated situations
where lawful and unlawful content are comingled. There would also need to be ample legal
process and safeguards to protect against mistakes.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES
 NO
 NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
