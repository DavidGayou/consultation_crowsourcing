     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the

effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the


16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?

21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to

                                                                                                              13
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

C.       Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

licensing of works and other subject matter?

emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
        Any initiative seriously intending to re-cast copyright at the European level must take
into account the extent to which, in the last two decades or so, the social and technological
basis of creation of works, including music, text, photographs and audio-visual content, has
been transformed.
The time has come to become aware that, in our post-post-industrial age, the long route which
used to lead the work from its creator to the public by passing through different categories of
businesses is gradually being replaced by a short route, which puts in direct contact creators
and the public and even leads to an increasing overlap between these two categories.
        On the production side, perfect digital copies often make “factories” of physical,
material copies of works redundant; the same development is now reaching the movie
industry. On the distribution side a similar. This is so because digital goods which are
distributed through the net are light rather than heavy, and use up a limited amount of storage
space. But even more so because the technological endowment held by the public at the
receiving end has in the meantime deeply changed. Here we have enormous excess capacity
residing with the public at large at the receiving end; and this excess capacity can be
mobilized to create distributive networks of extraordinary scale, scope and effectiveness.
        In this novel context, it would seem that the setting up of a relationship between
creator and business no longer has the same compelling rationale it used to have in the past.
Therefore both the production and distribution functions migrate from business to the public
and there they can rely on excess resources available at each consumption unit.
        What are the implications of this upheaval for the frame of reference of a EU
legislative agenda in the field of copyright? We can anticipate with some confidence that also
in the future production and distribution of works will continue to originate from two different
segments, the one relying on business and markets, the other on the production and
distribution mode which is based on decentralized non-market decisions, often referred to as
“social sharing”; that the latter segment, currently encompassing creations which go from the
open content made available by Wikipedia and Flikr, from free music and pictures to blogs
plus the massive volumes of user-generated content proceeding along the “short route” just
sketched out, will exponentially grow, dwarfing the market segment based on the “long
route”; and that the two components of creativity will not be mutually exclusive but will
interact.
        This is why any agenda for law-making for the digital environment which intends to
avoid being obsolete at the very moment it is adopted should today be so designed that, in a
not distant future, at least three requirements are met. First, the agenda should make room for
the step by step incorporation of rules which are appropriate not only for the long route but
also for the short route. Second, it should plan for the “peaceful coexistence” of the two sets
of rules, making them mutually compatible in such a way that the continued existence and
specific contribution of the two sectors is maximized. Third, obstacles inherited by the past
which unduly inhibit the emergence of the short route should be gradually phased out in ways
which should minimize the disruption of the workings of the old route.



                                                                                             15
       Against this background, let us think for a moment about the set of rules which would
appear to be appropriate, in the medium to long term, to meet the demands of creators
operating along the short route.
        In the market based model it was essential for creators and even more so for
businesses to control and restrict access to works, as the monopoly granted by expansive
exclusive rights enabled them to charge whatever price the market would bear. However, this
would not appear to be the goal of creators currently operating along the short route. The great
majority of them, be it 9 out of 10 or 95 out of 100, do not make a living out of “sales” of
“copies” of their works; they earn their livelihood in another activity or business and devote a
portion – often a very large portion – of their spare time to creating. In the new paradigm,
creation may consist in contributions based on cooperation, where each novel input is
intended to link with other reciprocal inputs to form a greater unit; it may give the contributor
a bit of extra income, professional credit, recognition or just fun (or a combination of the
three). Even when the creators operating along the short route are professionally engaged in
the creation of works, their business model usually is based on income flows different from
the sale of copies as such. Thus, it would appear that there is a shift whereby even singers and
songwriters increasingly rely on performances, tours, endorsements, merchandising and their
likes rather than sales of albums and tracks.
        If this is so, then what may currently be needed is a new kind of copyright, which
sometimes is labelled Copyright 2.0. The new system would have just a few basic features.
Old copyright, or Copyright 1.0, would still be available; but it would have to be claimed for
by the creator at the onset, e.g. by registering in a global copyright Registry. If no registration
is made, Copyright 2.0 would apply; and this would give creators just one right, the right to
attribution. In this model, Copyright 1.0 should survive; and we may anticipate that this is
likely to be resorted to by creators (and businesses) choosing to operate along the long route.
Indeed, the ultimate goal is not to displace old copyright, which seems to be alive and well in
many situations, but to add to the menu a second possibility, Copyright 2.0, which should be
better tailored to the characters of production and distribution of works prevailing in the
current digital environment.
However, creators should opt-in for Copyright 1.0 at the time of the original release of their
work; otherwise the new and more flexible Copyright 2.0 would operate as a default set of
provisions. This is why this approach is sometimes characterized as “Creative Commons by
default”. The idea behind the approach is that the very successful uptake of Creative
Commons licenses and other copyleft licenses by creators operating along the short route
shows that out there, in the digital prairies and wilderness, there is a very large number indeed
of creators who prefer to reserve only some rights rather than all rights; and that the time has
come for legal systems to recognize this fact of life by creating a regime in which downstream
freedom is the rule and a system under which creators may have the option to reserve some
rights or, if they like, all the old Copyright 1.0 rights, only if they wish and say so, by
resorting to a global registration mechanism.
       Coming to the question, the advantages of such a system would be numerous:
      i) it would greatly reduce transaction costs as licensing activity would be limited to
works which have been registered;
       ii) it would enhance circulation and dissemination of works;
        iii) it would reduce controversies in regard to the works, as there would be much more
certainty on circulation regime of each work and on identity of rightholders;
                                                                                                16
       iv) it would solve the problem of orphan works, already addressed by dir. 2012/28/EU.
        The defining feature of smart legislation is that it incorporates in its current
components which are already acceptable today but are designed to fit also in the next stage
of legislative development. Along these lines, the current exercise of recasting EU copyright
law should on the one hand strive to gain widespread acceptance and recognition already in
the current state of the play and on the other lay the ground for a second, more ambitious
legislative development, where EU action in the field of copyright becomes the initiator of an
overall revision of international copyright.
      In this perspective, the current exercise should more particularly incorporate a limited
number of features such as:
1. The phasing in of the machinery for a global digital registration system;
2. Updating limitations and exceptions, also in the light of the boundaries between the old and
the new and of the goal of contributing to their mutually advantageous coexistence. A first
point should tackle the issue of the mandatory nature of limitations and exceptions. In the
1886 Berne Convention only the right of quotation under Art. 10(1) is clearly mandatory.
Probably the time has come to ask ourselves whether there are other copyright limitations and
exceptions which should be made mandatory, in the meaning of being dictated rather than
enabled, in order to achieve a certain re-balancing of the expansion of copyright protection
and also in order to provide the wherewithal which may enable the new paradigm to grow and
become robust. We also should ask ourselves whether limitations and exceptions should be
made mandatory in another meaning of the world, that is by provisions which cannot be
contracted away; which is probably indispensable, taking into account that, while real-world
transactions did not imply written agreements (you do not need to sign a contract to purchase
a book), there is no economic transaction going on online which is not governed by written
terms and conditions, which always do away with limitations and exceptions. Another point
has to do with DRMs. Limitations and exceptions enabled by law should not be disenabled by
technology. Downstream users should have not only a claim to circumvent technological
restrictions, but also to have them removed by the entities which originally resorted to them.
Redress mechanisms, from ADR to class actions, should be put in place.
3. Special attention and care should be given to infrastructure which is used both by works
created under the new and the old paradigm. Just to make an example, enforcement towards
ISPs should take into account the impact the possible adverse effects this may have on the
emergence and diffusion of user generated content and other forms of creation under the new
paradigm.
4. The very welcome idea of introducing a EU-wide, unitary copyright should be devised in a
way to design it as a blueprint for the future international copyright. The time for Berne II has
come; and Europe has a chance to take once more the lead.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member

36

States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
        The EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions is flexible, but in the
wrong way. Instead of listing a few mandatory exceptions that all users could rely on and
leaving the judiciary authorities of the member States free to apply in certain special cases an
open-ended fair use clause, it lists a number of exceptions and limitations which are neither
mandatory nor entirely harmonized. As a consequence, we haven’t achieved neither legal
certainty nor harmonization, making the functioning of the internal market a chimera.

disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
        Preference should go for a list of mandatory, unwaivable exceptions and limitations,
coupled with a fair use clause that should be applied in certain special cases according to the
three-steps-test and subject to the prejudicial interpretation of the European Court of Justice.
         The advantages of such a system would be legal certainty and complete harmonization
around a common core of exceptions and limitations. This, in turn, will free the forces of the
market, making cross-border services possible – including educational services and research
activities. At the same time, there is no real cost to be afforded, since the freedom left to the
member State by the current EU framework has been used mainly to accommodate the
interests of local lobbies more than to pursue the common good.
       The introduction of a flexible, fair use clause would make it possible to accommodate
smoothly issues which are clearly de minimis or, if need be, to update current limitations or

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     X YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.


         [Italy; University; libraries and archives]
       CRUI is the association representing Italian public and private universities. In the
following, CRUI will represent the problems faced so far by the libraries and archives of such
universities in their attempt to take advantage of modern technologies.
         1. Digitization.



41
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
42
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.
43
   Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                           23
       Academic libraries and archives have been almost entirely prevented from digitizing
their collections by current copyright legislation without even any consideration to the
purpose of their endeavour.
        Generally, they are not allowed to make digital copies of protected materials hosted in
their collections although libraries and archives owned by public universities can make digital
copies of phonograms, cinematographic, or audio-visual works and moving images. Apart
from unduly discriminating private universities, this exemption is clearly ineffective. On the
one side, it does not allow the digitization of protected materials (such as books and
photographic works) which are no less in danger of getting lost due to their characteristics
(e.g. perishable or obsolescent media) or to their intensive use. On the other side, the
exception covers only the making of one copy (which is clearly not enough). As a matter of
fact, digital preservation typically requires multiple acts of reproduction, either for the sake of
format-shifting, backing-up, updating, migrating, or merging the databases of the library or
archive.
       2. Archiving and preserving digital-born copies.
        For the very same reason, academic libraries and archives are prevented from
effectively managing their collections of digital-born copies of protected works. As already
mentioned, the law allows them to make just one digital copy of works and protected
materials that fall into specific categories; outside such limits, libraries and archives cannot
simply make another digital copy lawfully. As a consequence, they cannot transfer a database
(or the visual or textual materials contained therein) or a multimedia work from a DVD to the
hard-disk containing the entire digital collection of the institution. Moreover, making
additional copies for the purpose of format-shifting would amount to making new,
counterfeiting copies.
       3. Acquisition v access.
        Academic libraries are increasingly investing part of their budget in digital
subscriptions. By doing so, they obtain a right to access a database for a limited period of time
instead of a permanent copy of books, journals and other sources of information. Sometimes
they are forced to do so because of the sky-rocketing prices of books and journals or the non-
availability of a paper substitute. However, in the long run this practice is likely to produce
adverse effects on one of the functions traditionally performed by such institutions, namely
harvesting copies of works, preserving the cultural heritage of the academic community, and
passing information on to future generations.
         Sometimes this effect can be mitigated when a service provider assumes a contractual
obligation to guarantee a permanent access to all or some of the information contained in his
database. However, problems may still arise. For example, if the service provider becomes
bankrupt, it is very likely that the dissolution of his enterprise would also take away the right
of the library to remotely access its account. Given the above, a far better solution would be to
make permanent copies of the pieces of information obtained through such services (i.e.
individual works, not the entire database) and archive them as a part of the collection owned
by the library. However, none of the existing exceptions to copyright seem to apply and, at
any rate, they would most probably be displaced by contractual terms forbidding such
activities.
       4. Open access.



                                                                                                24
        Since 2004 CRUI has promoted the Berlin declaration on Open Access among its
members and today more than 70 Italian universities have already adhered. As a result, many
of these universities have set up a digital, online repository to collect the scientific works of
their researchers. Furthermore, some institutions have enacted regulations to provide strong
incentives for the researchers who consent to making their works available online, free of
charge, through an open access academic archive.
        It is too soon to assess the full outcome of such initiatives as their implementation has
only just started. However, a few problems have already emerged. Building a repository and
setting up an open access archive requires the cooperation of both the researcher and the
publisher. In particular, the former should do two things: i) evaluate if the contracts he has
already signed would allow him to upload his works in the academic repository (i.e. without
making them publicly accessible) or, eventually, make his works available to the public
through the open access archive of his university (with or without a licence which would
make his works re-usable and not just freely accessible); and ii) ensure the publishing of his
new works are under contractual terms and conditions which give him such freedom.
        The first task is not an easy one since very often the publishing agreement is not in
writing or does not clearly state which rights are transferred or licensed by the author. Even
though this uncertainty could possibly be solved by relying on rules and principles contained
in our copyright law, it is very likely that the researcher (and his university) will not take the
chance of violating the rights transferred or licensed to the publisher. As a consequence, the
academic open access archive (and the public interest justifying its creation) suffers an
unwarranted deprivation.
        If one looks at the second task, more reasons of concern arise. The market for
academic publications is getting more and more concentrated since almost all major national
publishers have been absorbed within very few multinational companies or groups. As a
matter of fact, these multinational companies control the most prominent journals and book
series, which in turn allows them to determine unilaterally terms and conditions of publishing
agreements offered to researchers and universities. Frequently, these contracts buy-out all
copyrights in the would-be-published works, therefore giving the publisher the last word
about if and when the works will be uploaded in the academic repositories and, eventually,
made available to the public free of charge. Accordingly, researchers and universities are
forced to look after the cooperation of their publishers, which has proved far from enthusiastic
outcomes. After being invited to declare their «open access policy» - meaning, the conditions
that they would like to see applied to works published on their journals or books series – in
the majority of cases they have either remained silent or declared conditions too restrictive,
requiring long terms embargos if not prohibiting entirely such re-uses.
       5. Archiving and making available for evaluation purposes.
        In the last years, public funding of academic institutions has been made increasingly
conditional on the evaluation of the quality of their research output. To this end, researchers
have been required, inter alia, to declare periodically if they have published new works and,
in that case, to provide for a digital copy, which in turn will be circulated for peer-review
purposes. Given the number of academic institutions and researchers to be evaluated, putting
in place such a system has not been an easy task. However, one thing has made it
overwhelmingly complicated: the strenuous opposition of many publishers to provide their
authors with a digital copy of their published works and let them communicate these files to
the independent authority in charge of the evaluation procedure. Apparently, they were afraid
that their file could leak out one way or another, thus destroying the market for legitimate
                                                                                               25
copies. To avoid such risk, they volunteered to feed directly a database set up on purpose by
the evaluating authority and, by doing so, they complicated even further the entire procedure
and delayed its completion.
        It goes without saying that building digital academic repositories and making them
accessible online would be highly beneficial also in this respect, speeding up the pace of
evaluation procedures and, hopefully, fostering the quality of academic research. However,
this won’t happen if the obstacles to digitization (no. 1) and to the feeding of academic
repositories (no. 4) won’t be removed soon, together with the ambiguous wording of the
exception provided by Italian copyright law for administrative procedures.
       6. Consultation services.
        If they are not allowed to digitize their own collections (no. 1, 2 and 3), the the
academic libraries are also prevented from organizing their services in a modern way. Firstly,
they cannot take advantage of the exception for on-site, digital consultation services [art.
5(3)(n) Infosoc directive]: if the content is not available, it does not make sense to put
computers in the libraries. Secondly, they cannot offer printing services (i.e. printing – to
paper or to .pdf files – a digital copy of the book) which has the same effect as photocopying
but does not damage the original. Thirdly, they cannot reply to inter-library requests by
simply sending a digital copy instead, therefore being forced to lose time and resources with
mail services. Fourthly, they cannot lend digital copies (hosted by a physical support – like a
CD or DVD or e-book reader – or «liquid») of fragile or rare originals which may be lost and
therefore, many times are simply not made available for lending.
       7. Participation to European networks.
        The aforementioned constraints have another side effect which is particularly odious
for institutions who are have been used traditionally to openness and participation to wide,
international networks. Being incapable of digitizing their own collections, Italian academic
libraries and archives are prevented from cooperating with other European cultural institutions
and share the costs of building digital repositories which, sooner or later, could be made
accessible to the public as a source of information or as an instrument to elaborate new
information (i.e. for big data analysis).

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


       The problems that were mentioned in the reply to Question 28 can best be solved
through a legislative reform of directive 2001/29/CE (Infosoc directive).
        It is true that some of these problems are caused by Italian law and could be solved
locally, taking advantage of the freedom given to national legislators by art. 5(2)(c) of the

                                                                                            26
Infosoc directive, which allows Member States to exempt specific acts of reproduction made
by archives and publicly accessible libraries. However, there are uncertainties on the exact
meaning of this rule, particularly in respect to what a «specific act of reproduction» may be
and as to the purposes of the reproductions that could be exempted. Moreover, reforming
Italian copyright law would neither solve the problem of lack of harmonisation [confirmed
recently by the Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related
Rights in the Information Society (the “Infosoc Directive”), commissioned by the EU
Commission and published in 2013, at 272 ff.], which prevents partnerships and joint
initiatives among European academic institutions, nor lead to the introduction of new
exemptions going beyond the exhaustive lists of art. 5 Infosoc directive.
       Additionally, there are issues (e.g. those relating to open access) which are relatively
new and, therefore, not taken into account by the Infosoc directive. It may be argued again
that some of them can be solved by national legislators, however, it does not seem wise to
allow national laws to go their own way since this would curtail the ability of the European
Union to realize some of its core policies [see, also on this point, the Study on the Application
of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society (the
“Infosoc Directive”), commissioned by the EU Commission and published in 2013, at 285].

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]


       1. Digital libraries and archives.
       Art. 5(2)(c) Infosoc directive should be clarified, extended and made mandatory.
       Firstly, archives and public accessible libraries should be allowed to make all digital
copies necessary to digitize and preserve their collection of works, including works acquired
through digital subscription services and digital harvesting.
        Secondly, they should be authorized to use such digital copies to perform their
traditional services, namely i) providing access on site, ii) lending individual copies, iii)
allowing their patrons to make private copies, and iv) sending copies to other libraries upon
request (inter-library lending).
        Thirdly, they should be allowed to provide additional services, namely access to their
digital collections for data mining purposes.
       Fourthly, they should be allowed to distribute digital copies of their works to archives
and publicly accessible libraries which already possess an analogic copy of the same works
(thereby sharing the costs of digitization).
        Lastly, they should be allowed to make available online works which are already out
of print or out of commerce, subject to the payment of an equitable compensation to the right
holders [on this point, see also the reply to Question 40].

                                                                                              27
       2. Open access.
        Open access policies may have a chance to reach their goal only if the law takes care
of protecting researchers against buy-out contracts increasingly offered by major scientific
publishers. To this end, a viable solution could be to give researchers who have assigned or
licensed the exclusive right to publish their scientific works, the unwaivable right to make
such works available to the public through academic open access archives when a reasonable
period of time (i.e., 6 or 12 months) has lapsed from their publication by the assignee or
licensee.
       Additionally, it could be expressly stated that a contract assigning or licensing
exclusive rights in a scientific work which has been created in the fulfilment of a publicly
funded research project is null and void, given that such work should be made available to the
public according to open access principles (see, for example the rules governing Horizon
2020).
       3. Archiving and making available for evaluation purposes.
        Universities should be allowed to store all works published by their academic staff and
distribute them for peer-review purposes. By the way, this seems a good example of a result
that could have been achieved smoothly if only European law had provided for an open-ended
fair use exemption similar to the one provided for by US copyright law, on top of the specific
exceptions and limitations listed in art. 5 Infosoc directive.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in


                                                                                            28
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]


       32.a [Institutional user: universities]
        Generally speaking, Italian academic libraries have not invested in extensive
digitization projects and, therefore, have not accumulated enough experience with the
application of the exemption for on-site consultation through digital means. As already
mentioned, this may be due to the absence of a reasonable exemption covering the digitization
of analogic collections. In this regards, it should be added that the wording of art. 5(3)(n)
Infosoc directive – which refers only to the «communication or making available» without
expressly allowing the digitization that would make them possible – has not helped.
        Being prevented from using the exemption, Italian academic libraries have, thus far,
relied almost entirely on subscription services, sometimes covering both on-site and remote
consultation.
        Generally speaking, publishers have been collaborative and, when requested, have
allowed remote access. However, some issues have still arisen. Firstly, remote access has
been made available – frequently, though not always – with spatial limitations, typically only
to registered users connected to the institution’s network (i.e. within the university’s premises
and not from home). Secondly, it has also proved difficult to provide access to former
members of the academic staff who continue to collaborate even after their retirement or to
temporary users (e.g. external researchers participating to specific projects) after the end of
their contractual relationship.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


        Art. 5(3)(n) Infosoc directive should be amended to state clearly that libraries,
museums, and archives can i) digitize their collections, ii) make them available for
consultation to their patrons (all of them if consultation takes place on-site, or registered users
only if consultation takes place off-site), iii) who are allowed to use to this end their own
devices, and iv) print or save excerpts for offline, off-site consultation.
       Additionally, it should be clarified that the exception cannot be contracted out in
purchasing or licensing agreements, even if they relate to analog or digital copies of the work.


                                                                                                29

3.      E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
X     YES – Please explain with specific examples


        36.a [Library: academic libraries]


       In Italy, e-lending has so far proven quite unsuccessful. The reason lies in the
widespread, though disputable [see European Court of Justice, C-128/11, «Usedsoft»], idea
that digital distribution does not lead to the exhaustion of IP rights in the copy being

                                                                                             30
distributed coupled by the perception that such copies cannot be lent to the public at the same
conditions applicable to loans of tangible copies (i.e. payment of an equitable remuneration
or, in certain special cases, free of charge: see directive 1992/100/EEC). This, in turn, has led
to the necessity of negotiating complicated licensing agreements with publishers and service
providers (or «aggregators»), instead of simply acquiring a certain number of digital copies
for each work and making them temporarily available to the end users (e.g. through online
services or distributing new files that can be used for a limited period of time). Moreover,
publishers and service provider have been negotiating such agreements from a relatively
strong position which allows them to impose licensing terms that appear quite unreasonable
for several reasons.
         Fearing the lost of control over the number of copies being distributed, many
publishers do not licence genuine e-lending rights. Instead, they offer (directly or through
intermediaries) libraries services which, in turn, can be passed on to end users, allowing them
to access a website where the works are hosted and/or download a copy protected by a DRM.
By doing so, they tend to offer a pay-per-access service which is expensive (too expensive for
many libraries) without being efficient. Firstly, it is the publisher (and not the library) who
decides which books can be «lent». Accordingly, he can exclude some categories of books
(e.g. course books, which are more remunerative if sold in hard copies), or newly released
titles, or books which are not faring well on the market. Moreover, he can use DRMs which
do not allow private copying (or do not leave the user free to copy every part of a book) and
other fair uses (e.g. copy and paste of text and other materials for discussion purposes) or
make the content accessible only through some devices and not others.
        If available, genuine licensing agreements are not satisfying either. Despite the fact
that «producing» an additional digital copy of a work entails marginal costs tending to zero
and, as a consequence, «selling» that digital copy produces growing marginal earnings,
publishers tend to apply prices that are modelled to those usual in the analogue era, therefore
reproducing in the digital environment a scarcity which is entirely artificial. This is also true
for e-lending services, which are licensed under conditions that make lending the same work
simultaneously to multiple users unreasonably expensive. As a consequence, libraries are
forced to keep long waiting lists even if this does not make sense in the digital era. On top of
that, licensing agreements may provide further limitations that make e-lending even less
attractive. They may relate to the characteristics of the digital copies supplied by the
publisher, which frequently do not adopt the most refined and compatible standards (e.g.
ePub) and contain DRMs blocking all or some fair uses (including those relating to people
with disabilities).
        One last remark relates to the relationship between e-lending and the preservation of
library’s collections. If one combines the increasing substitution of the purchase of books and
journals with the subscription to digital information services (see reply to Question 28), on the
one hand, and the substitution of consultation and lending services with a e-lending services
managed by publishers or aggregators, on the other hand, it becomes clear that, in the digital
age, libraries, including academic libraries, lose control over their collections and will be
unable to perform their traditional function of harvesting and preserving works that express
our cultural heritage. There is no need to observe that something has to be done soon.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]


       Three different approaches could be proposed.
        One solution is to build on the concept of digital distribution and apply to digital
copies a regime modelled on property, therefore allowing the owner of a digital copy to
perform all acts of reproduction which are necessary to fully enjoy and dispose of that copy.
This, in turn, would permit to regulate e-lending just like its analogue predecessor – namely,
providing for equitable remuneration and, in special cases, exempting some public institutions
from payment. It goes without saying that such freedom would be limited to the number of
copies owned by the library, therefore leaving room for licensing agreements if the library
needed to overcome such limitation.
        Another potential solution could be to introduce a new exemption for e-lending of
digital copies of works, provided that the service is offered by a publicly accessible library
(including academic libraries) without any indirect economic or commercial advantage and
subject to the payment of an equitable remuneration to the relevant categories of right holders.
If fears arise that such an exemption would run afoul of the three steps test, it could be added
that the number of simultaneous accesses to a single work should not exceed the number of
copies of the same work lawfully acquired by the library. As a consequence, this solution
would also leave some residual space for voluntary licenses.
        A far less attractive solution is the recourse to a memorandum of understandings
between representatives of the publishers and representatives of libraries (or of academic
libraries alone, for example), establishing standard conditions for individual contracts. The
experience made with out of print works, at least in Italy, does not appear encouraging.
However, if this was the only viable option, the memorandum should cover at least the issue
of catalogues that may be lent, the characteristics of digital goods (format and DRMs) made
available to the public, and the requirement of applying prices affordable for libraries wishing
to offer such a service.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]


       There are a lot of differences, some of which were already mentioned in the replies to
the previous questions. In this connection, two different situations should be considered: i)
                                                                                             32
online collections «owned» by a library; ii) online collections «owned» by publishers or
service providers and licensed to a library.
       Managing online collections owned by the institution itself is obviously easier.
However, it is not like dealing with a physical collection, as it poses at least the problems
already mentioned in the replies relating to «preservation and archiving», «off-premises
access», and «e-lending».
         Things get even more difficult when online collections are owned by someone else
who licence them to the library. In such cases, the first issue relates to the contractual
conditions applied by service providers, who frequently offer their entire collection and not
individual works or categories of works while charging additional fees for each and every
additional service made available (e.g. document delivery) or simply denying some of them
(e.g. interlibrary loans). Another important issue is the «volatility» of online collections: both
their availability and preservation depends on the existence of the service provider and on the
continuative payment of licensing fees. If one of the two conditions fails, the online collection
vanishes, no matter how much money was invested into it by the library. Thirdly,
management is made difficult by the fact that control on content, type of files, uses allowed
and performed, and the data and statistics rests solely in the hands of the service provider and
not in hands of the library. Fourthly, libraries would have to perform a lot of back office work
as online services are not always stable.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between

activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation

44
          You will find more information about his MoU on                      the   following   website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .

                                                                                                      33
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


       To the best of our knowledge, the 2011 Memorandum of Understandings on out of print
works has not been used thus far in Italy as a basis for new initiatives in this field. The only
digitization projects undertaken by Italian universities and government authorities in the last
years relate to works and documents that are already out-of-copyright. It is, therefore,
impossible to provide feedback based on this practice.
        However, if one were to reason abstractly, there would be problems with that model.
For one thing, Italian law does not provide for extended collective licensing systems which
seem essential for every mass digitization endeavours that cannot take advantage of an
exception to copyright. Moreover, even if an Italian legislator were to one day introduce an
extended collective licensing system for out-of-commerce works, he would not have
jurisdiction over the copyrights granted by other Member States. Therefore, it seems unlikely
that any legislative measure taken at the national level could resolve the problem of cross-
border dissemination of digitized out-of-commerce works. At the very least, a system of
mutual recognition of extended collective licenses granted by the collective management
organizations of the Member States should be put in place.

  France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
X YES – Please explain


           [42.a: institutional user; universities]


         Problems have risen as a consequence of three concurrent factors: i) the
inconsistencies within EU law; ii) the lack of effective harmonisation; and iii) the too
restrictive approaches adopted by some national legislators (e.g. allowing only use of «parts
of works» or prohibiting the making available online of teaching materials). Art. 5(3)(a)
Infosoc directive is relatively well conceived, however, it does not apply to software and
databases. Additionally, it has been implemented in very different ways by national legislators
[see Study on the Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights in the
Information Society (the “Infosoc Directive”), commissioned by the EU Commission and
published in 2013, at 368 ff.]. This, in turn, leads to a situation of great legal uncertainty

                                                                                               35
which prevents universities from offering their courses (including distance learning courses)
on a cross border basis.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO



43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
        Art. 5(3)(a) Infosoc directive should be generalized (i.e. applied to all works and other
protected materials including software and databases), clarified (i.e. allowing the use of an
entire work, if needed; expressly covering distance learning courses; allowing uses made for
teaching and learning purposes including the use by teachers but also the uses performed by
the students), and made mandatory. It is true that national legislators could possibly solve
some of these problems internally, particularly, those who have been too wary in
implementing the Infosoc directive. However, it seems very unlikely that all, or at least most
of them, will reform their laws any soon. Accordingly, without action at the European level,
universities and other educational institutions will not be able to start offering their online
services across borders, individually or jointly through partnership agreements.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
        The adoption of open access policies by academic institution across the world is going
to greatly enrich the repertoire of scientific works that can be accessed and reused freely for
educational purposes. As already mentioned (see reply to Questions 28 ff.), some actions
should be taken at European level to remove or prevent potential obstacles. Moreover, social
sharing of the results of publicly funded research projects should become the rule.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
X       YES – Please explain


           Some of the problems are identical to those already mentioned in the reply to Question
42(a).
        There are, however, a few peculiarities. Copyright law can hinder research activities
either by a) restricting circulation of copyrighted works or by b) preventing re-use of
copyrighted works. On the one side, researchers may find it difficult to work on a specific
subject without having full access to the prior art. On the other side, they may be prevented
from sharing copyrighted works with their colleagues, or using protected materials contained
in someone else’s work to make their own assertions, or extracting data and information from
existing works or databases. To remove these obstacles to the greatest possible degree, a
number of initiatives should be undertaken.

                                                                                              37
        As to the problems that could be summarized as «access to knowledge» issues, it
seems that a combination of actions at the EU level could be very helpful. In particular:
i) facilitating preservation and archiving (see reply to Question 28);
ii) making off-site [see reply to Question 32(a)] and e-lending [see reply to Question 36(a)]
services real;
iii) protecting and enhancing open access initiatives (see reply to Question 28); and
iv) enabling mass-digitization (see reply to Question 40);
would all make existing knowledge safe and more accessible, and would also benefit
researchers.
         Some of these actions would also have positive effects on the issue of reuse of
protected materials for research purposes. As open access expands, the freedom of researchers
to share and reuse existing works or datasets will also grow. At the same time, building huge
digital libraries and archives is a crucial step towards providing academic researchers with
raw data that could be used for automated big data analysis. Accordingly, it would be a shame
if text and data mining were not expressly liberalized (see reply to Question 53).
        By doing so, there is also a chance of enabling our research institutions, including
academic research centres and laboratories, to play a greater role in the near future as partners
for small and medium sized enterprises or as incubators for innovative start-ups. To this end,
art. 5(3)(a) Infosoc directive may be supplemented by an interpretative instrument clarifying
that the limitation applies also to research activities performed by not-for-profit institutions
acting under R&D agreements with commercial partners.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?

copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?

  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .


                                                                                                     40
  YES – Please explain
        In order to assess if and to which extent copyright could interfere with
text/data/content mining (TDM), we try to clarify the nature of TDM.
To begin with, we make three assumptions:
1) Texts, contents and data which are object of TDM are protected by copyright: if not, the
problem of interference by TDM in copyrights would not exist;
2) The final output of TDM is not a “derivative work” or a “substantial part of the original
DB” (where “work” is the text or content and “DB” the database object of TDM): if it were,
the consent of the original work/DB rightholder would be required;
3) The single information and data which are sorted out of TDM are “public”, in the sense
that are not restricted by other exclusive rights (e.g. personal information or image rights).
This assumption does not mean that the overall output of TDM cannot be covered and
protected by copyright (e.g. “computer-based works”) or by DB right.
       If these three conditions are met, a few consequences derive.
        First, the main and usual aim of TDM is to extract “public” information and data, that
is contents and ideas (explicit or hidden) which are contained in a work/DB. Copyright does
not protect the content and ideas on which the works are based. Such contents and ideas
enclosed in the work/DB are freely accessible and re-usable by anybody, regardless copyright
on such work/DB, because copyright only protects the way in which such contents-ideas are
expressed. TDM is the tool to free open knowledge and create new knowledge buried in
copyrighted works/DB.
         Second, TDM does not imply “exploitation” of the work, in the sense in which
“exploitation” is protected by copyright: a “TDMiner” does not enjoy the work, nor exploits it
commercially, neither to create “derivative works” or to communicate it to the public (in the
broadest sense). Additionally, a TDM output does not interfere with copyrights on the original
work/DB (assumption n. 2). The TDM activities which could formally violate copyright (such
as permanent/temporary reproduction of a copy of the work/DB) are ancillary to legitimate
activities of public interest: free open knowledge and create new knowledge. We may
reasonably affirm that such activities do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the
work/DB and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
        Third, TDM is functional not only to scientific research purpose but also to businesses
and commercial or non commercial activities. In all such cases the above considerations are
valid. In all such cases rightholders are not prejudiced.
        Reasoning further on the above, we believe that the basic issues to tackle for TDM are
the following:
a) When TDM requires a copy of the work/DB (temporary/permanent), it should be clarified
that such reproduction does not conflict with the copyright on of the work/DB. (Therefore a
copyright exception/limitation should be provided in order to permit TDM without copyright
infringement);
b) If TDM requires mere access to a copy of the work/DB, as long as the “TDMiner” has
legitimate access to the relevant text, content and data, then there is no copyright
infringement. An idea reaffirmed by the Open Knowledge Foundation in the “data mining
declaration” of June 1, 2012, which states “the right to read is the right to mine”.

                                                                                            41
c) Facilitate access to relevant text, content and data for TDM purposes, by law (exceptions
and limitations, compulsory licensing schemes) and by agreement (standard licensing
models);
d) Consider attribution an open issue: it is not indispensable but it may be an incentive;
e) Address technological issues, platforms, standards and interoperability: standardized API,
handling web traffic and server infrastructures capability to manage heavy traffic; digital
works repositories dedicated exclusively to TDM.

F.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 X YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

                                                                                           50
[Open question]
        There are reasons to back the creation of a single EU Copyright Title which are both
short and medium term. A single EU copyright title would have immediate advantages in
several regards. In the short term:
        i) EU-wide licensing would be the default rule; but this would not prevent rightholders
or assignees/licensees to agree on more limited territorial rights at the EU member State or
regional level;
       ii) A unique set of limitations and exceptions would avoid the – all too obvious –
outcome that harmonization, which has to leave a minimum of flexibility, results in greater
disharmony than the one which triggered harmonization in the first place;
       iii) A single EU Copyright title would bring benefits also in areas such as DRMs,
enforcement (including uniform rules for ISPs liabilities and immunity).
        In the medium term the EU might lead a more ambitious project: to conceive the
single EU Copyright Title as a blueprint for the phasing in dual system for copyright
protection, including a Copyright 2.0 intended to enable digital-networks driven cooperation
to create works. As stated earlier (see reply no. 16), also this latter tool requires exclusivity,
albeit in an attenuated, Creative Commons-like form. To provide for this dual mode of
protection would be the starting point for a process leading to a Berne II-Convention, which
the EU has the potential and prestige to lead at the global level. In this phase, the global
registration system and the default mode for Copyright 2.0 protection should be the first
building blocks towards the establishment of a dual system of copyright protection.
