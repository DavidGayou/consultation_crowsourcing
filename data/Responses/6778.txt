    I.         Introduction

It has become increasingly clear that copyright reform is necessary in order to meet the
needs and demands created by the uses of copyrighted works in our modern society. The
need for copyright modernisation arises from the dynamic changes that have occurred in
the medium that people access and use copyright works such as newspapers, books, music,
films and broadcasts. The radical move to digital by people in their everyday lives for
purposes of relaxation, entertainment and doing business online has engendered a demand
for online service provision. This means having access to copyright works in ways that were
never before considered within the confines of the existing copyright framework.

The essence of legislating for the use of copyrighted works is to ensure that a carefully
preserved balance exists between the need for rightsholders to reap the just rewards from
their creative efforts and those wishing to use and enjoy these works. This balance is a
delicate one as it strives to provide an optimal reward system for creators while these works
should be available also for the benefits of society as well as a means to facilitate the
creation of an environment conducive to innovation.

Furthermore, Copyright regimes need to act in a manner that facilitates innovation which is
key in paving the way for economic growth. In order that businesses can flourish, they must
be encouraged to innovate. If it is the case that the existing copyright regime designed at an
earlier time acts as a barrier to that growth, it is more than timely to look closely at the
model and adapt it to meet the new realities of the digital era. The European Commission
Consultation is part of a discernable trend visible in many jurisdictions throughout the world
showing a renewed focus on the need for copyright reform to reflect the changes in the
digital era.

In Ireland, an independent committee was appointed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise
and Innovation to examine Irish copyright legislation to identify any areas that might be
considered to create barriers to innovation and, if this was found to be the case, to identify
solutions for removing these barriers. In October 2013, the Committee published a wide-
ranging report entitled ‘Modernising Copyright’. The Report contains in excess of sixty
recommendations spanning diverse areas of copyright related activity. The Irish


                                              3
Government is currently examining the recommendations in the Report against the broader
policy context and the legal scope affecting each of the recommendations. It is expected
that there will be formal proposals for legislative reform arising from the Report in 2014.

It is clear that there is much common ground visible from the topics and issues raised in the
‘Modernising Copyright’ Report and its recommendations and in the issues raised by the
Consultation Paper prepared by the European Commission. Ireland welcomes the initiative
by the European Commission to progress the Copyright reform agenda at EU level by
undertaking this public consultation and looks forward to working in partnership with other
Member States and the European Commission in this process.




   II.     Rights and Functioning of the Single Market

Linking and browsing
The act of hyperlinking is fundamental to internet and social media usage. Hyperlinking has
been the subject of questions referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union,
illustrating the need for clarity and legal certainty. Ireland welcomes clarity afforded by the
recent judgment in the Svensson case (C-466/12) and awaits the outcomes in Bestwater
International (C-348/13) and C More entertainment (C-279/13) with interest.

The independent report prepared by the Copyright Review Committee in Ireland has
recommended that linking should not infringe copyright, except where the provider of the
link knew or ought to have been aware that it connects with an infringing copy. The report
further recommends that it should not be an infringement of copyright to reproduce a very
small snippet of the linked work reasonably adjacent to the link. Legal clarity in response to
the questions referred to the CJEU above in the context of the evaluation and consideration
of these recommendations would be welcome.

In many instances, the creation of a cache or temporary copy where the technological
processes of transmitting data result in transient and incidental copies of the data is the
technological norm. Temporary copies including web caches are also currently the subject



                                              4
of questions referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, illustrating the need for
clarity and legal certainty.

Temporary acts of reproduction are provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC and
this has been transposed into national legislation in member states. It may be worthwhile
to review the interpretation of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC once the findings of the
CJEU are known in relation to C-360/13.



Download to own digital content
According to the copyright principle of exhaustion, once a copy of a work is sold or
distributed within the European Union with the consent of the rights holder, the latter may
not control or prevent further distribution of that copy. However, if the work in question is
in digital format, this raises a different set of criteria than was potentially envisaged under
the principle of exhaustion, particularly in relation to licencing agreements, maintenance
and provision of updates in the software industry.

The findings of the CJEU in the case C-128/11 Oracle International Corporation v UsedSoft
GmbH have rendered many licencing terms and conditions void under the exhaustion
principle fundamentally impacting on distribution, license and maintenance models. It had
been the case that licencing agreements were entered into at a reduced cost (such as for
educational or similar institutions) with terms and conditions prohibiting resale of these
licences. Dismantling licencing terms and conditions has the undesired effect of potentially
increasing the cost of the latest software. This may become particularly pertinent for those
institutions that had previously benefited from reduced-cost licencing arrangements for
example: for education and training purposes.

Arising from the CJEU findings, the reselling of previously used digital content originally
distributed via download does not infringe the copyright holder's distribution right, provided
that the originally downloaded copy is deleted or rendered unusable. Despite the obvious
benefit for consumers to have the option of purchasing previously used digital content at a
lower cost, it may become increasingly difficult to determine whether they are purchasing a
legally valid, previously used digital property from a legitimate source.         The sale of
previously purchased digital content will also frustrate counter-piracy measures especially

                                              5
for digital content subject to updates and patches such as software.             It will become
increasingly difficult for the relevant industry to determine whether a copy is a legitimate
and legally acquired copy and whether the primary copy has been deleted as is required
under the principal of exhaustion. The resulting loss of revenue to the relevant industries
could ultimately lead to loss of jobs, innovation and essential revenue streams to
rightsholders and content creators.



Term of protection
The terms of protection for copyright in the European Union are amongst the longest terms
of protection available internationally. In any potential re-examination of appropriate term
of protection for the digital era, it is worthwhile to strive for balance in protecting the rights
and income stream of rightsholders with that of the potential benefits of greater access
works by the public. Consideration of the longevity of works in the digital era should also be
a factor as well as whether this should be industry or format specific.




   III.    Limitations and Exceptions in the Internal Market

Greater harmonisation across EU Member States should be encouraged for exceptions that
would be beneficial in key strategic policy areas and facilitate societal goals. This could
include non-commercial uses such as research or private study, illustration for teaching or
scientific research as well as for reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments,
museums or archives. A mandatory EU-wide exception with cross-border effect for uses for
the benefit of people with a disability could enable better cross-border collaboration and
establish a precedent for best practice that could serve an example in international fora
such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation.




                                                6
Teaching
The education exception should remain limited to formal education in the non-commercial
sector. In order make the education exception suitable for the digital era, it could cover
new methods of educational instruction such as distance learning and uses by educational
establishments of works available over the internet for the purposes of teaching and
instruction.



Data and Text Mining
In light of changes in technology and how research is carried out in the digital era, it would
be useful to explore the possibility of a legal provision for data and text mining for scientific
research purposes. This would resolve the current uncertainty around the legality of data
and text mining under EU copyright law and ensure that researchers in the European Union
are not at a competitive disadvantage internationally to further research and opportunities
in this emerging research area.



User Generated Content
It could be argued that user generated content could be covered under Article 5(2)(b) in
Directive 2001/29/EC, which provides for “reproductions on any medium” for private use
and for non-commercial ends. It would however, be prudent to explore the possibility of a
legal provision to address user generated content stipulating that any such use is exclusively
for non-commercial purposes, accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement to the original
creator and that the new work does not have a substantial adverse effect, financial or
otherwise, on the exploitation or potential exploitation of the existing work.




   IV.     Private Copying and Reprography

Personal use and format shifting
Private copying in particular has evolved in the digital era and it would be useful to re-
examine the personal use exception in light of technological change and common usage. A


                                               7
provision to allow for format-shifting would provide a legal basis for what is current
common practice for users who have legitimately acquired copyright material. For example:
where an individual has already purchased a CD, that it would not be an infringement to
allow for reproduction on any medium for personal use and non-commercial use of the
music in question such as from CD to MP3.



Fair compensation and licencing
The interpretation of ‘fair compensation’ by Member States who levy charges in relation to
the private copying and reprography exceptions is fragmented and not uniformly applied
throughout the EU. While Ireland does not support the use of levies, it is clear that for
those countries where these systems are in operation, there is a need to simplify
procedures and to reflect recent findings of the CJEU, particularly concerning the concept of
‘harm’.

In relation to services that have been already licenced by rightsholders where digital copies
have been made by end users, the approach suggested in the Vittorino recommendations
outlines this scenario and suggest a logical consideration of this matter. Where a user has
already subscribed to a service where the rightsholder has licenced the use of their works
for the service and been paid a fee, there should be no further claim to ‘harm’ resulting in
private copying levies. This should be the case even when the service in question has the
inbuilt facility for making copies for private use – such as playlists, as the rightsholder would
be aware of these facilities in agreeing to licence their works for inclusion in the service.



Levies and the internal market
Ireland does not impose levies on goods as copyright legislation in Ireland does not have
exceptions which require the payment of ‘fair compensation’. The issue of double payment
of levies for companies operating in the European Union is a genuine barrier to trade, in
particular for small and medium enterprises, and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.
The status quo is extremely inefficient as companies operating in the European Union are
required to bear the financial burden of payment of double levies and then, should they be




                                                8
in a position to recoup levies paid, bear the administrative burden of often complicated
procedures which differ from country to country and from device to device.

While Ireland does not support the use of levies, it is clear that for those countries where
these systems are in operation, there is a need to simplify procedures and to reflect recent
findings of the CJEU. The approach suggested by António Vitorino could be a useful guide as
it suggests that levies should only be collected in the country in which the final user has
his/her residence. This is appropriate as this is the country where the reproduction will most
likely be made and, therefore, also the country where the 'harm' as defined in Case C-
467/08 (Padawan vs SGAE) would occur. It should also be a tenant that any levies payable
should only be collected once in any cross-border transactions and that the number and
types of levies payable should be dramatically reduced.
