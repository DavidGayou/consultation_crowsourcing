	




Reaction	to	Public	Consultation	on	the	review	of	the	EU	copyright	rules	
	
	
I'll	leave	aside	the	arguments	why	and	simply	state	the	executive	summary	
of	my	opinion	regarding	copyright:	
	
I	think	that	copyright	was	once	useful	for	a	specific	goal,	quite	different	
from	what	the	general	perception	has	become,	and	that	the	current	state	of	
copyright	having	been	hijacked	by	large	corporate	interests	does	a	
disservice	to	the	originally	intended	benificiaries.	
	
To	reform,	it	is	necessary	to	recognise	the	roots	and	return	to	a	form	
embodying	those	original	goals.	The	goal	was	and	should	be	securing	
enrichment	of	our	culture.	Thus,	the	primary	benificiaries	are	the	people,	
and	securing	some	income	for	"creators"	is	a	means	to	an	end,	not	an	end	in	
itself.	
	
Here	we	see	how	the	hijacking	has	taken	place:	First	the	creators	were	made	
more	important	than	the	people,	then	their	corporate	agents	became	more	
important	than	the	creators	themselves.	
	
You	can	see	this	very	clearly	in	how	"big	entertainment"	chooses	to	
structure	payments	to	the	creators.	Another	sign	on	the	wall	is	that	
copyright	lasts	well	past	the	lifetime	of	the	creator.	Neither	creator	nor	
the	people	is	served	by	this.	It	makes	no	sense,	and	it	needs	to	stop.	
	
Thus,	I	would	propose	a	structure	modeled	on	the	original,	for	example	as	
follows:	Copyright	lasts	the	longer	of	twenty	years	or	the	lifetime	of	the	
creator,	which	must	be	a	natural	person.	That	is,	even	if	the	creator	dies	
his	publisher	will	have	a	reasonable	time	to	recoup	investments.	
	
In	this	scenario	copyright	should	not	be	tradable	but	inalienable;	a	
creator	might	lend	it	to	a	publisher	in	return	for	an	advance	but	it	
should	revert	to	the	creator	automatically	after	a	set	time,	perhaps	twenty	
years.	This	to	prevent	hoarding	by	large	corporations.	
	
One	could	equally	argue	that	since	a	publisher	is	a	risk	taker,	an	
after-life	period	is	entirely	unnecessary.	Likewise,	why	should	one's	
one-time	labour	yield	lifetime	returns?	An	inventor	only	gets	twenty	years	
and	has	a	harder	task	monetising	his	efforts.	So	an	argument	for	simply	
twenty	years	no	matter	what	is	possibly	more	reasonable.	
	
The	bottom	line	is	that	the	current	state	of	affairs	is	entirely	out	of	
hand,	does	not	serve	the	intended	benificiaries,	and	in	fact	deprives	the	
people	of	their	own	popular	culture.	Works	part	of	popular	culture	must	
become	generally	available	after	a	reasonable	time,	and	the	current	state	
of	essentially	several	lifetimes	is	not	in	any	way	reasonable.	


	
	




	
It	should	be	needless	to	say	but	it	sadly	is	not,	that	in	this	light	DRM	is	
being	used	as	a	weapon	to	extort	the	people	with	over	their	own	cultural	
commons.	It	is	inexcusable,	and	so	are	any	further	copyright	extensions.	
	
Copyright	needs	to	be	curbed,	made	shorter	and	less	restrictive.	Exactly	to	
restore	its	function	of	fostering	enrichment	of	culture	through	creative	
works,	and	to	discourage	corporate	abuse	of	the	people's	heritage.

by	my	hand,	which	can	be	found	here:
