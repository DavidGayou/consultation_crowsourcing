    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

rather the lack of efficient protection for copyrighted content online.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of

  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

of computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 6
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


The making available right is in its current form sufficiently clear and crucial both to licensing
and enforcement of rights.
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


We do not believe that the territorial scope of the making available right needs clarification.
The conflict of law rule for copyright provides adequate means to enforce copyright. For
criminal matters, a greater cooperation in the Internal Market would be helpful.



14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Hyperlinks per se should not be considered as making available when the link leads to an
authorised copy of a work or other subject matter. They therefor should not be subject to prior
approval provided that the rights holder is entitled to set restrictions on access to the materials
at the end of the link. However, in cases where the link leads to illegally made available
material or to copyright material not previously made available to the public, as it is with

right. Automated restrictions on access such as prohibitions on crawling must be followed by
search engines, or the search engines will be deemed infringers and/or contributory infringers.
More generally, The Swedish Association of Educational Publishers is able to endorse the
views and conclusions expressed in a report of ALAI, available at:
http://www.alai.org/en/assets/files/resolutions/making-available-right-report-opinion.pdf


       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
     ES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
The actual viewing of a page (from a user´s perspective) should not be subject to authorisation
when it involves a genuine act of temporary reproduction as a necessary technical process.
However, the making available of copyright protected content on a webpage so that internet
users can view it can and should only be done under authorisation of rights holders.
Authorisations can be implied. Illegal display of pdf on websites and illegal streaming
constitutes an increasing form of piracy.
Moreover, rights holders should be able to decide whether a work is available for indexing by
search engines.

circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further



                                                                                                 9
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The ability to resell previously purchased digital content would have severe economic
implications. Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the
development of new business models and it is hard to foresee that the exhaustion rule applied
to electronic content would be compliant with the three-step-test of the Berne convention.
There are several reasons why the conditions and approaches which apply with regard to
physical goods should not also obtain in the digital marketplace. The simple assumption that
because a certain approach works for physical it should, almost axiomatically, be made to
apply to digital is overly simplistic. The attempt to straightforwardly transplant physical terms
to the digital market ignores hugely significant key differences between how the markets
operate. Ignoring these differences places the strength of the creative economy in jeopardy, in
that creators´ rewards and incentives would be eroded, along with the incentives and abilities
of creative companies to invest in them.
The underlying philosophy of the copyright framework is to give the author exclusive rights
in the first-hand market, because this is where the greatest value can be derived and where
they are likely to maximise their reward. It also ensures that their moral rights are
maintained.


19
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
20
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              10
In the physical domain, it follows that it can be tolerated for the author not to also have full
exclusive rights in the second-hand market: specifically the exhaustion of the distribution
right can be tolerated as the author is deemed to have earned sufficient reward in his first-
hand market.
However, this logic is drastically changed in the digital world because here the second-hand
market is largely indistinguishable from the first-hand, owing to three vital characteristics of
digital goods.
(1)    Digital works in the second-hand market are identical to the original of the work only
in the sense that they contain the same work; however, physical works in the second-hand
market are identical in the strictest interpretation of the term “identical”: i.e. the second-hand
work is one and the same thing as the first-hand work.
(2)    Digital copies can be numerous, to a near-infinite degree, and therefore the second-
hand market can be bigger than the first-hand market. In the physical world, this is
impossible since the second-hand market can only ever be as big as the first-hand market and
is always likely to actually be smaller. Given the trivial ease with which Digital Rights
Management tools can be hacked and cracked, it is no comfort to say that “forward and
delete” approach could solve this issue.
(3)     From these two points it follows that whereas digital copies are and remain pristine
and faithful, physical copies suffer from deterioration. This means that goods in the physical
second-hand market are inferior to the first-hand (increasingly so over time) and so goods in
each market are less substitutable. For example, a dog-eared copy of “The Da Vinci Code”
on its fourth outing on the shelves of a charity shop is clearly inferior to the brand new copy
in a high street bookshop.
The upshot of these three factors is that the ability of the author/publisher to earn just reward
in the first-hand market would be severely curtailed by the untrammelled reselling of digital
content. They would face unfair competition from the second-hand market, in which the
providers of goods have borne none of the risk of investment in the creation of the product,
nor have borne any of the production costs, other than the trivial cost of reproduction. This
would generate unfair price competition to the distinct disadvantage of the first-hand market.
Furthermore, the impact on levels of online copyright infringement would be likely to be
significant. Monitoring unauthorised distribution is difficult enough in the prevailing
conditions; however, it would become untenable to monitor and track infringement in a newly
legitimised second-hand market in which there was no discernible difference in the product.
Pirate copies would be indistinguishable from the legitimate copies.
Further, it is more difficult to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a
physical sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing use of
the physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case – both the seller
and purchaser can continue to use the digital product. The implications for widespread
copyright infringement – and concurrent difficulties in enforcement – are clear.
Nor is there a significant consumer loss if the sale of digital second-hand books remains
prohibited. First, because the on-going sale of second-hand physical books would be in no
way affected; secondly, because there is no clear discernible potential value to the consumer
of selling second-hand ebooks.
There is a further potential for harm to the consumer. A rational response from
authors/publishers to the challenge of lost value in the second-hand market would be to raise
prices in the first-hand market in order to cover anticipated losses. This would be a perilous

                                                                                               11
strategy as it would entail losing further market share to lower prices in the second-hand
market. It would also impose higher prices on those consumers who wanted first-hand works.
This idea is also based on a wide-spread false apprehension of the fact that e-books are
cheaper than paper books. E-books are in fact not much cheaper to produce than print books;
we estimate that digital production allows savings of about 15-20% (printing, storage and
distribution) – everything else (paying authors, editorial, marketing, etc) is still there in
digital. In any event, only a tiny marginal proportion of publishers only publish ebooks,
almost all publishers need to publish in paper and in digital form, so the reduction of costs, for
a market that is no more than 1% in Sweden and in the majority of Member States is not
significant at all (the UK is an exception with 15% market share of e-books, France, Italy,
Spain and Germany between 2 to 3% but most of the countries across the EU are counting
less than 1%). Moreover, the digital market is still so nascent that there are still big initial
investments needed to move to digital. So all in all for the time being producing ebooks costs
about the same, if not more.
So for these reasons it has to be clearly acknowledged that the digital marketplace is
importantly different to the physical one.



C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


     NO
The book publishing sector already has a voluntary registration system for the identification
of books (ISBN), works (ISTC), and party names (ISNI), to assist with identification,
discoverability and licensing. The book industry was the first cultural sector to create an
international standard to identify books with the ISBN, which was introduced in 1965 and
now applies also to e-books and educational software.
The Swedish Association of Educational Publishers does not believe that any additional
system of registration needs to be created and applied to the publishing sector. We also reject
the notion that registration should be a prerequisite for the protection and exercise of rights.



21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             12
The new environment is challenging in this area, since it requires standards for identification,
description (to facilitate retrieval in the Internet) and formats, to ensure interoperability
between different devices.
European publishers are actively committed to the development of open standards along the
production chain, including identification (ISBN, ISTC), metadata (ONIX), web resolution
(DOI) and – very important for e-book portability – digital format (.epub). Dialogue with
other players along the book value chain will be essential for full deployment of such
standards.
The identification and licensing of works and other subject matter is better served by
improvements in facilitating discoverability; and in the streamlining of licensing. Publishers
are working to improve both of these.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such



23
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       13
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Identifiers are crucial for the efficiency and transparency of CMO operations. EU can support
tools for rights information management and licensing by encouraging the interlinking of
databases and improving metadata standards and identification.



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
         – Please explain
We believe the current terms of copyright are still appropriate. Book publishers do not benefit
from a copyright term of protection but acquire rights from their author(s) for a certain period
or the length of the author copyright term. The author(s) in turn receive(s) royalties for the
exploitation of his (their) work. Intellectual property is a fundamental human right which like
other property should be passed to the owner’s heirs, at least for one generation and there is
no reason, be economic or philosophical, to deprive an author from this right in the digital

environment. This is based on a false assumption that the creativity input and dissemination
effort would be less in the digital context.
It is a human right to express oneself in writing. When one has written something it should be
assured that no one else can alter or use it without authorisation. The author should be
recognized.
A reduction of the term of protection could also be detrimental to the exploitation of a work as
often authors need to wait the publication of more than one work before knowing some
commercial success or often meet success at a later stage, e.g. after an on screen adaptation of
their book takes place.
Authors and publishers must be able to enjoy return on investment, which the current term of
protection provides if commercial success comes at a later stage.
It would not be fair if an author during many years has created a great work, if the copyright
to the work, the property and right to decide over the work, suddenly expires after a shorter
period of time. Greater respect should be given to creativity. It is also not possible to impose
different terms of copyright to different works, so that “better” works would have a longer
term of protection than “worse”. We cannot have any authority deciding on the quality of
works.
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
28
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
31
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                                                                                            15
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
We do not see any specific problem arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
are optional for the Member States. There is no reason to make some of them “compulsory”.
Optional exceptions allows for more flexibility to tailor copyright frameworks. Differences
between national copyright laws do not represent an obstacle to the creation of an online
market for the publishing sector which is healthy and thriving.
Instead, the real obstacle to the online market is the threat of illegal downloading which
prevents legal offers from being marketed on a level playing-field. We would need to see


32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           16
evidence that a harmonised set of exceptions would bring proven benefit without harming the
current publishing market.


  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
As explained in question 21, we disagree with the idea that some or all exceptions should be
made mandatory. The fact that they are optional leaves room for the right amount of
flexibility needed in a fast changing environment. Conditions of use of right are better served
both for the users and the rights holders when handled through licence agreements, which add
to the flexibility and serve users across borders if needed.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
We do not see the need to add new exceptions to the existing catalogue. Any new exception
should answer a market failure and the inability to serve users with licencing solutions.
Licenses are the most flexible instrument available in order to meet each user’s individual
needs in the relevant use case. New exceptions set prematurely in a fast moving world where
technologies evolve very rapidly would certainly stifle business innovation and the ability of
publishers to develop offers to serve new needs.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The current 20 optional exceptions with broad scope and wording offer the necessary
flexibility, balanced with legal certainty. We do not believe that broader wording of
exceptions would serve the purpose of better harmonisation. Broader wording – or any such
change – would lead to legal uncertainty for both rights holders and users. Publishers invest in
content and increasingly license it for digital transmissions and need to be able to rely on a
firm set of rules to continue to deliver economically for the EU and morally for creator. We
believe this is currently delivered via the 2001 Copyright Directive.


                                                                                             17
National courts and the EUCJ already play a central role in the legal interpretation of
exceptions. However, introducing more flexibility and especially a general rule such as Fair
Use into the EC legal system would only bring legal uncertainty, thereby challenging the
ability of publishers to conduct business.

Fair Use in the U.S. provides a statutory defence mechanism to what could actually be
infringement of exclusive copyright. This means that rights holders are forced to challenge
uses in court after the event. The test is based on a century of U.S.-jurisprudence and this
jurisprudence would not be readily available to the legal framework in Europe – indeed it
would impose an unreasonably heavy burden of interpretation on EU courts as they struggle
to reconcile two such dramatically different regimes. Users will lose legal certainty as the
whole system will be far more dependent on the circumstances of each case. Cases such as the
Google Book Settlement illustrate how big commercial players can exploit the legal
uncertainty around the US doctrine to economically exhaust rights holders, who often cannot
afford expensive litigation.
We believe that there is currently flexibility in the EU copyright system thanks to the space of
manoeuvre left between EU and national legislation when transposing the EU copyright
framework. This being said, any legislation, however technology neutral, runs the risk to be
too closely tailored to business models and technologies of its day rather than allowing for
future developments. In contrast, licences are by far the quickest, most flexible and most
effective way of achieving technology neutral and targeted solutions.
It should be remembered that limitations and exceptions are by their very definition applied
only in certain special cases where the Three Step Test has been complied with and therefor
where there is no properly functioning licensing market. In contrast to licensing solutions that
are continuously developed and improved by rights holders´, exceptions and limitations can
only be a blunt and often ineffective tool.


  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

Publishers frequently rely on exceptions, e.g. for quotations. Anyway, when possible,
publishers favour licences which are flexible and balanced. Licences foresee uses across
borders and can, unlike legislation, rapidly adapt to changing environments.


     NO OPINION


27.   In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
This is the core of the problem from our point of view. In the current economic setting and
with budget cuts occurring especially in the areas of culture and education, we do not believe
that public authorities would be willing to compensate exceptions with cross-border effects if
that meant spending taxpayers’ money on benefitting tax-payers in another Member State.
Licenced solutions are acceptable in closed networks of schools, universities or libraries, but
if exceptions allowed uses involving communicating content on the internet (having
potentially wide cross-border effects), it would be difficult, if not impossible, to compensate
in a fair and balanced manner. It should also be remembered that Member States also have
very distinct and separate systems for fair compensation, for example levies.
And we ought to remind at this point that it is commonly agreed also by users that authors and
publishers need to be compensated for several current exceptions which undermine the
original exploitation of their work.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Any perceived “problems” can be solved by market-based solutions, but we are not aware of
any such problems. Rights holders´ and their representatives can issue cross-border licenses.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
We believe that licensing should be encouraged. Any library exception allowing making
available online would only create unfair competition with business models, and be contrary
to the three-step-test.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different

when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems

borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
Since the middle of the nineties, there is a model agreement in use in Sweden, between
libraries and publishers, for the licensing of e-books to the libraries. The model is called the
Elib-model. The library´s cost to lend one e-book to one patron, one time, was set to 20 SEK
in the agreement. The sum was half of the cost of the administration of a printed book at that
time. Half of the payment, 10 SEK, goes to the distributor of the e-books, Elib, and 10 SEK to
the publisher and author of the book, to be shared according to their individual royalty
agreement. This model is still in use but both publishers and libraries are unsatisfied with it
and mean that it doesn´t work anymore. Publishers and authors are unsatisfied because their
revenue is too low and the libraries because they don´t have any control over their expenses
for the e-books. Publishers are negotiating agreements with libraries individually today. Most
likely there will be many different licensing solutions in the future.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
There is no need for legislation on libraries purchase and lending of e-books. The Swedish
book market is free and deregulated and the libraries are customers among other customers to
the publishing houses. Any perceived problems can be solved by encouraging licensing and
sharing best practices, but not by creating legislation which would prejudice commercial
exploitation of books and inhibit the launch of new service and technical and business
innovation. Publishers would like to find a solution that not hampers the commercial market
of e-books.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

                                                                                             22
The digital lending of e-books is combined with challenges for the libraries when it comes to
their social mission to work for education and to promote reading. There is a risk that libraries
become a place that attracts fewer visitors. Libraries remain essential institutions for readers
and are a relevant part of the book world including the digital evolutions. There would be no
more reason to maintain local libraries, as a single central service would be sufficient, if the
traditional activities of on-premises and public lending would develop towards online
developments.

For publishers the change towards a bigger digital lending market is in competition with the
commercial market.



4.        Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
It is not copyright that prevents digitisation projects but the lack of public funding.

37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain

Swedish educational publishers offer a wide range of printed textbooks, teacher manuals and
other learning materials for all subjects and classes in K-12. Publishers also offer a wide range
of digital textbooks or other digital learning materials for all subjects and classes. There are
both stand-alone textbooks with interactive features, components complementing printed
textbooks and resources for interactive whiteboards. Digital learning materials allowing
teachers to track the progress of each student are developed. At least one publisher has started
to license modules and parts of books and all publishers are attentive to evolving needs of
teachers.

Printed materials are delivered to schools from retailers or publishers directly. Digital
materials are delivered on-line, usually on a one-year license basis. Skolfederation is an
initiative, run by the Swedish national domain operator .SE, to provide a single sign-on
solution for schools, which facilitates both access to and use of digital learning materials.

It should be noted that the concept of “illustration for teaching” must be understood as a
narrow exception, not including production of teaching material or multiple copying for
classroom use that undermines the normal exploitation of these works.

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
The Swedish RRO Bonus Copyright Access manages an extended collective licensing regime
that works very well. In 2013, two new agreements were concluded for K-12 and higher
education respectively.

The agreements allow teachers and students to make copies of fifteen printed and digital
(including scanning) pages from printed and digital works, thus providing flexibility and the
possibility to tailor educational materials from many sources. The agreements make possible
distance learning, for which rights holders saw a need in schools and which was explicitly
requested by universities. Licensed digital materials are not covered. The regime provides for
cross-border renumeration.

A broad exception to copyright would undermine the educational mission of publishers. There
is, moreover, in Sweden a well-functioning collective licensing system that is responsive to
the needs of the educational community.




                                                                                                25

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
It is not clear that there is any problem that requires solution. There is no evidence that a
harmonised compulsory broader exception would not harm the market, nor is there evidence
of a market failure where some learning needs are not being catered for. Swedish collective
licenses allow a lot of uses, and individual licences can complement these by allowing more,
including cross border uses. Instead, Member States should be encouraged to maintain
adequate budgets for education, including the acquisition of educational resources, both
physical and – where possible – digital.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.       Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

There are current exceptions to copyright rules to facilitate the production of special formats
required to give people with a disability access to copies of books. To provide for use beyond
that, agreements are very important. Swedish educational publishers are, however, very much
collaborative with institutions providing people with a disability with such copies.

Agreements between rights holders and trusted intermediaries are more important than the
mere application of limitations or exceptions to facilitate the production of special formats
when needed, and facilitate access to accessible copies of books.

In Sweden, publishers collaborate with institutions supporting the visually impaired by
providing them the original files for the requested books, which result in a decrease of the
production costs of special formats. We believe that projects such as ETIN, the European
Trusted Intermediaries Network, which suffers from lack of finances, is very valuable to
overcome any technical or practical hurdles.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question] The state agency Specialpedagogiska Skolmyndigheten (The National
Agency for Special Needs Pedagogy) has the task to supply educational materials to students
with disabilities. The agency primarily works through the market by giving subsidies to
educational publishers to convert their products for students with disabilities. When the target
group is to limited for any commercial supply, the agency produces its own materials.


There is an exception in 17 § of the Swedish copyright law, allowing copyright protected
material to be converted and used by people, including adults, with a disability. There is,
however, concern that this exception, with digital distribution, is being exploited by groups
for which it is not intended.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast

43
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                                28
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
Data protection issues may arise of anyone was able to mine all content on the open internet,
without appropriate check and balances.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new

45
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           30
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
The answer is both yes and no.
It is true, that the value chain for online distribution is not fair when it comes to illegally
published works. The right holders get nothing, but advertisers advertising on pirate sites,
credit card companies connected with the sites and internet service providers profit from the
traffic to the pirate websites.
………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
When it comes to the relation between authors and publishers: Publishers are naturally very
much in favour of a fair remuneration for their authors. Ensuring this is a vital part of their
core mission. Authors are associated to the success of their work, they usually receive an
advance to complete their work and then royalties proportionate to the sale of their work.
There are only exceptionally situations of buy-out clauses and lump sums to authors, as is the
case with performers and audiovisual authors.
Contracts in publishing are based on individual negotiations. Collective author agreements are
not practiced in the book publishing sector in Sweden since 1996.
There already exist rules in the Swedish Contracts Act that can assure that contracts not
include unfair contract terms.

  V. Respect for rights



                                                                                            36
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
We believe that the current EU legal system framed by the 2006 Enforcement Directive is
satisfactory, although some measures could be introduced to improve the civil enforcement
system. It is necessary to strengthen respect for copyright. The civil enforcement system in
the EU must be harmonized and rendered more efficient. The rapid evolution of the internet
has created new ways to infringe copyright, which was not envisaged when the Enforcement
Directive was discussed, adopted and implemented in Sweden. The political climate was also
not in favour of rights holders, why necessary changes to copyright law was hard to introduce
into Swedish legislation and new enforcement measures took long to decide.
In some countries there are legal possibilities to have illegal websites blocked and there are
reasonable collaborations with ISP´s on the blocking of sites that give illegal access to
copyrighted content. Blocking has been successful in promoting legal digital services. The
blocked sites often contain a reference to legal sites and many choose not to try to circumvent
the blocking. It is a way to change the behaviour of people. In Denmark the campaign Share
with Care has proved that rights holders, ISPs, consumers and politicians are able to cooperate
in reducing copyright infringements. In Sweden, we don’t have any rule on blocking or any
collaboration with ISPs on blocking or reducing copyright infringements.
The EU Commission should review the level of enforcement possibilities in the member
states to better ensure that digital content services are provided the same protection from
illegal competition from illegal sites throughout the EU.
In Sweden, the enforcement tool implemented through the IPRED-directive, is called the
IPRED-law. It has not been sufficient to tackle copyright infringements due to a lack on
obligation for ISPs to store data that can be handed out in civil cases. According to the
IPRED-law, a rights holder can apply for a court order that obliges an ISP to hand out

56
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
57
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           37
information about the identity of a person who had a certain IP-number at a certain time, from
which it is likely that copyright infringement has been committed. The Data Retention
Directive, implemented in Sweden 2012, only covers data that ISPs are obliged to store and
hand out to crime preventing authorities. There is a lack of rules regarding the obligation for
ISPs to store data that can be handed out in civil cases.
There is also a lack of rules on code of conduct of the ISPs. There is an authority, The
Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) that monitors the electronic communications in
Sweden. The rules that ISPs have to follow are scarce. They play a fundamental role in
connecting people to the internet, why there should be introduced a code on their conduct, so
that also rights holders interests are taken care of, not only the users.
It does not make any difference when it comes to the damage it causes the rights holders
whether the purpose of a copyright infringement is commercial or not. The distinction
between commercial and non-commercial is unclear, as most of the “non-commercial”
exchange websites benefit from advertisement revenues and, although it is difficult to
measure, file exchanges and downloads do represent a loss sale. However, the priority is to go
after the source from where the illegal websites are originating.
The Enforcement Directive needs to extend the presumption of ownership to holders of
exclusive licenses or to assignees of copyright owners.
There should be introduced a producer right for publishers as they do not benefit from a
“related right”, in the same way music producers, film or database producers do. It is negative
for publishers when it comes to digital copyright infringements. It is rarely the author but
mostly the publisher that will have the resources to take legal action against infringements.
Publishers have a need for a producer right equivalent to the producer rights for music, film
and database producers. Publishers make investments in the publishing of books and that
investment need protection.
There are many digital services offering digital books, but they suffer from illegal competition
in the form of download and streaming services for pirated audio books and e-books. The
Swedish legislation is not clear on whether it is illegal to listen to the illegally uploaded
streamed audio books and there is a widely held belief among the public that it is not.
According a study by MediaVision, Svenska filmkonsumenter under lupp, 2014, the use of
illegal streaming has grown by 500 percent over the past five years.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The Swedish Association of Educational Publishers believes that clarification would be
welcome when it comes to the involvement of intermediaries. We need a clearer legal
framework for the ISPs responsibility, e.g. under the E-commerce Directive. See also answer

                                                                                             38
above to question 75 on code of conduct for ISPs, monitoring their activities, and the need of
rules assuring data retention that can be handed out to rights holders in civil cases.
In Sweden, there is no regulation on Notice and Takedown for intermediaries. There is a clear
need for that.
There is also no rule that prescribes that rights holders can apply to the court for an order
according to which intermediaries are imposed to block access for internet users to a certain
site that predominantly contains illegally uploaded copyright protected material. There are
possibilities to obtain court orders for internet service providers to block sites like
thepiratebay in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Finland,
Denmark and Norway. Studies show that blocking is effective.
We regret that ISPs have not been willing to have a dialogue on illegal up-and-download. It
is necessary to come to workable solutions to tackling online copyright infringement. The
collaboration with ISPs will be of primary importance in securing better respect for
intellectual property rights online. ISPs provide access to the Internet and interconnect the
underlying networks, host websites and servers. ISPs should have a responsibility to assist in
tackling copyright infringement online, regardless of their accountability for the content itself.
We strongly agree that it would be useful to “clarify [that] injunctions should not depend on
the liability of the intermediaries”, and that the notion of liability of ISPs should be clarified
when they can have several functions (hosting or editing). ISPs have a responsibility to assist
in tackling copyright infringement online, regardless of their accountability for the content
itself. There is limited capacity in the national courts (as well as the limitation of rights
holders’ time and money) to bring the number of actions against infringers necessary to curb
infringement. Besides, as a first step, notice and take down procedures should be introduced
in Sweden. Indeed the main problem arises from the difficulty to gather all the elements
necessary for the notice and in particular to determine who the publisher of the website is, so
as to send him the notice as the same time as to the ISP.
Search engines can do more to reduce online copyright infringement through preventive
measures such as preventing automated searches returning unlawful links and by responding
efficiently to ‘notice and take down’ notifications. Similarly, links that receive a high number
of notice and takedown requests should be deranked from search results.



77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
Of course data privacy rules are capital to the respect of European citizens' right to privacy,
however, they should not act as a shield to illegal activities. Instruments such as the
Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) are essential to provide rights holders with the means to
fight against piracy i.e. article 8 on the right to obtain information about infringements and
infringers. The 2006 Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) requires ISPs to store data and


                                                                                               39
communicate it to relevant authorities, but there is no obligation to store data and
communicate it in civil cases such as the Swedish IPRED-legislation.
One non-legislative solution could be to adapt contractual practices of ISPs to facilitate the
transmission of data to rights holders. Currently, it is very challenging in most countries for
publishers to face time-consuming and expensive court procedures every time their
intellectual property rights are infringed online.
  NO OPINION

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]

We do not believe that a single EU Copyright title will bring any benefits to the development
of content online, which is progressing well in the publishing sector. Differences between
national copyright laws do not constitute an obstacle to the creation of an online market for
the publishing sector. As mentioned previously, the publishing sector benefits from a healthy
pan-European licensing system which is not stifled by the level of difference among the
Member States legislation.
