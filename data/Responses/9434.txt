   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


Multi-territorial  licenses  to  use   musical   works   including   Finnish
repertoire are granted on a daily basis and for many thousands  of  products
every year. As a way of  example,  iTunes,  YouTube,  and  Spotify  are  all
licensed on a multi territory basis.


Sävellysteosten rajat ylittävä käyttöoikeuksien lisensointi  on  jo  pitkään
ollut arkipäivää, ja suomalaiset teokset ovat edustettuina  mm.  sellaisissa
online-käytöissä kuten iTunes, YouTube ja Spotify.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


There is no current problem with cross-border licensing  under  the  current
copyright framework. Piracy and  the  lack  of  a  reduced  VAT  for  online
cultural products are the real challenges.


Sävellysteosten lisensointi toimii nykyisen lainsäädännön puitteissa  hyvin.
Teosten  rajat  ylittävän  liikkuvuuden  esteitä  ovat  mm.   piratismi   ja
kulttuurituotteiden korkea verotus.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


No. Rightsholders have no special reason to  impose  such  restrictions.  As
mentioned  before,  there  are  numerous  multi-territorial   licenses   and
services available on a  pan-European  basis,  but  some  service  providers
prefer to roll out their services on a country-by-country basis.  There  are
various commercial reasons to this, all  based  on  service  providers’  own
interests.


Ei. Oikeudenhaltijoille ei ole tarvetta alueellisiin rajoituksiin. Kuten  jo
edellä  todettiin,  rajat  ylittäviä  palveluita   on   jo   pitkään   ollut
saatavilla,  mutta  jotkut  palveluntarjoajat  ovat   omista   kaupallisista
syistään pitäneet parempana edetä maa kerrallaan.





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


No. As mentioned before,  the  existing  EU  copyright  framework  has  been
enabling the development of numerous licensing models at European level.


Ei.  Kuten  edellä   on   todettu,   voimassa   oleva   EU-lainsäädäntö   on
mahdollistanut  suuren  määrän   rajat   ylittäviä   lisensointimalleja   ja
palveluita.


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


Yes. The concept is sufficiently clear. Multi-territorial  licensing  should
remain on a market driven approach and contractual  and  commercial  freedom
must be preserved. The EU could have  a  role  in  encouraging  cross-border
licensing, but it should not be mandatory.


Kyllä. Käsite on riittävän hyvin määritelty.  Rajat  ylittävän  lisensoinnin
tulee  olla  markkinalähtöistä  ja  perustua  sopimuksiin   ja   yrittämisen
vapauteen. EU:lla  voi  rohkaista  koko  yhteisön  kattavaan  lisensointiin,
mutta tämän toimintamallin ei tule olla pakollinen.




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[23])?


Yes. Introducing new measures  to  clarify  the  territorial  scope  of  the
making available right would have an effect in the recognition/  enforcement
of our rights and thus should be avoided.


Kyllä.  Käsitteen  uudelleen  määrittely  vaarantaisi  teoksiin   liittyvien
oikeuksien tunnistamiseen ja suojan.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


No. In any licensing situation there is a whole bundle  of  rights  to  deal
with. In case of licensing the use of musical works  these  two  rights  are
normally licensed together under one agreement  for  the  ease  of  the  end
user.


Ei.  Useimmissa   lisensointitilanteissa   joudutaan   neuvottelemaan   koko
joukosta käyttöoikeuksia.  Musiikkiteoksia  lisensoitaessa  näistä  kahdesta
käyttöoikeudesta   sovitaan   yleensä   samalla   kertaa,   mikä   helpottaa
luvantarvitsijoiden toimintaa.


Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[24]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[25] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


Yes. The supply of a link to a certain copyrighted work on a website  is  an
act of communication to the  public  and  needs  the  authorisation  of  the
rightsholder.  There  is  an  infringement,  if  the  hyperlink   leads   to
unlicensed content. However, there  is  no  infringement,  if  it  leads  to
licensed  content  the  making  of  which  has  been   authorised   by   the
rightsholder.


Kyllä.  Linkittäminen  tekijänoikeuden  suojaamaan  teokseen  on   yleisölle
välittämistä  ja  edellyttää  oikeudenhaltijan  lupaa.   Oikeuden   loukkaus
tapahtuu,  jos  linkki  johtaa  ilman  oikeudenhaltijan   lupaa   saataville
saatettuun sisältöön. Jos saataville saattaminen on  tehty  oikeudenhaltijan
luvalla, oikeuden loukkausta ei tapahdu.




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


Yes. Article 5.1 of the Copyright  Directive  outlines  when  there  can  be
exceptions to the exclusive right of  reproduction.  This  exception  should
not be broadened.


Kyllä.  Tietoyhteiskuntadirektiivin  artikla   5.1   määrittelee   kappaleen

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[26].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[27].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


It would have devastating effects on the  music  industry.  Users  would  be
allowed to create perfect copies of the original  work  and  distribute  any
number  of  these  copies  to  others  without  the  creator  receiving  any
compensation.  The  need  for  technological   protection   measures   would
increase, and the original copies would be much more expensive.


Sillä  olisi  tuhoisa  vaikutus   musiikkiteollisuuteen.   Tarve   teknisten
suojauskeinojen   käyttöön   kasvaisi,   ja   alkuperäistuotteiden    hinnat
nousisivat.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[28]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[29].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


No. Compulsory registration would be against Article 5(2) of the Berne
Convention. This Article states that the exercise of copyright is not
subject to any formality.


Ei. Pakollinen rekisteröinti olisi vastoin Bernin sopimuksen Artiklaa 5(2).
Artiklan mukaan tekijänoikeuden käyttämisen ehdoksi ei saa asettaa mitään
muodollisuuksia.





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


It would create more burdens for  rightsholders  without  any  guarantee  of
better protection of their rights.  Musical  works  are  already  registered
through collective rights management organisations  (CMOs).  Music  industry
is working towards the creation  of  a  GRD  (Global  Repertoire  Database),
which will provide a comprehensive and authoritative source of clean and  up
to date data on the ownership and control of musical works. GRD will be  for
the benefit  of  composers,  artists,  music  publishers,  users,  CMOS  and
consumers.


Järjestelmä  toisi  ainoastaan  lisävaivaa   oikeudenhaltijoille   antamatta
minkäänlaisia  takeita  paremmasta  oikeuksien   suojasta.   Sävellysteokset
rekisteröidään  jo  tällä   hetkellä   kattavasti   tekijänoikeusjärjestöjen
kautta. Musiikkiteollisuus on  parhaillaan  toteuttamassa  maailmanlaajuista
teosten rekisteriä. Valmistuessaan Global Repertoire Database (GRD)  tarjoaa
kattavan,  luotettavan  ja  ajantasaisen  tiedon  musiikkiteoksista,  niiden
omistajista ja eri käyttöoikeuksien hallinnoijista. Tästä  hyötyvät  kaikki:
tekijät,  esittäjät,  kustantajat,  käyttäjät,   tekijänoikeusjärjestöt   ja
kuluttajat.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


The most important incentive is the certainty that when  a  CMO  is  working
efficiently and transparently, rightsholders are ensured of  prompt  payment
of their royalties.


Tärkein  kannustin  on  se,  että  tehokkaasti  ja   läpinäkyvästi   toimiva
tekijänoikeusjärjestö   pystyy    takaamaan    oikeudenhaltijoille    nopeat
tilitykset.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[30], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[31]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[32]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[33] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.








  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


The music publishing community is committed to, and deeply involved  in  the
ambitious   GRD.   The   Commission   should   continue   to   promote   the
interoperability of  rights  ownership  databases  and  especially  the  GRD
through political and possibly funding support.


Musiikinkustantajat ovat sitoutuneet GRD:hen ja ovat  keskeisinä  toimijoina
mukana  sen  rakentamisessa.  Komission  tulisi  edistää   teostietokantojen
yhteentoimivuutta  ja  erityisesti  tukea  GRD:tä  sekä  poliittisesti  että
taloudellisesti.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[34]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

Yes. The current term is appropriate. The creative industries are long term
industries that require a long time to recoup on the significant
investments made. The current term of protection is in line with the EU’s
main trading partners, facilitating the management and enforcement of
intellectual property rights on the international stage. To change this
would place EU authors at a great disadvantage.


Kyllä. Nykyinen suoja-ajan kesto on oikein mitoitettu. Luovan alan
investoinnit ovat mittavia ja vaativat pitkän ajan tullakseen katetuiksi.
Nykyinen suoja-ajan kesto on linjassa EU:n tärkeimpien kauppa-kumppaneiden
kanssa, mikä on välttämättömyys tekijänoikeuden toimivuudelle
kansainvälisellä tasolla. Suoja-ajan lyhentäminen asettaisi yhteisön
tekijät muita huonompaan asemaan.


 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[35].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[36].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[37], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[38],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[39].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

No. The most relevant and significant limitations and exceptions  have  been
adopted by the majority of EU Member States. Some  Member  States  have  not
implemented all  the  exceptions  and  that  is  due  to  national  cultural
specificities. This does not have a cross border impact  that  needs  to  be
addressed.

Ei. Merkitykseltään keskeisimmät rajoitukset ja  poikkeukset  ovat  voimassa
useimmissa jäsenmaissa. Joitakin  sallittuja  poikkeuksia  ei  ole  saatettu
voimaan kaikissa maissa, mutta tähän on  ollut  kulttuuripoliittisia  syitä.
Näillä poikkeamilla ei kuitenkaan ole rajat ylittäviä vaikutuksia.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

No. National differences are due to cultural preferences and  as  such  part
of the European cultural diversity that must be protected.


Ei.  Kansallisiin  eroavuudet  perustuvat  kulttuurisiin  painotuksiin,   ja
niillä on Euroopan kulttuurista monimuotoisuutta edistävä vaikutus.



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


The  way  exceptions  and  limitations  are  defined  in  the  EU  Copyright
Directive already provides a good balance between rightsholders’ and  users’
needs.


Tietoyhteiskuntadirektiiviin kirjatut sallitut  poikkeukset  ja  rajoitukset
toteuttavat hyvän tasapainon  oikeudenhaltijoiden  ja  käyttäjien  tarpeiden
välillä.


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

No. The current EU framework provides sufficient flexibility.  As  mentioned
above, the current limitations and exceptions took  into  consideration  the
different  legal  traditions  of  EU  Member  States   and   the   continued
functioning of the  Internal  Market.  The  focus  should  be  on  the  good
application of these exceptions.

Ei. Nykyinen  EU-sääntely  on  tässä  suhteessa  riittävän  joustava.  Kuten
edellä  totesimme,  mahdollistetut  rajoitukset   ja   poikkeukset   ottavat
huomioon  jäsenvaltioiden  perinteiset   käytännöt   sekä   sisämarkkinoiden
toimivuuden. Huomio on EU-tasolla  kohdistettava  siihen,  onko  poikkeukset
saatettu voimaan oikealla tavalla.

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

No. The territoriality of the exceptions and limitations  does  not  distort
or create discrepancies in the Single Market.


Ei. Poikkeuksien ja rajoitusten maakohtaisuus ei  häiritse  sisämarkkinoiden
toimivuutta.


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

The status quo should  be  preserved.  Current  EU  law  only  requires  the
application of the  fair  compensation  principle  to  the  private  copying
exception. EU Member States have the flexibility to apply the  principle  to
others,  for  example  some  Member  States  apply  it  to  the  educational
exception.


Nykytilanne tulisi säilyttää.  Nykyinen  EU-lainsäädäntö  ainoastaan  vaatii
hyvitysmaksuperiaatteen   soveltamista   yksityistä   kopiointia   koskevaan
poikkeukseen.  Jäsenmailla  on  oikeus  soveltaa  periaatetta  myös   muihin
käyttöalueisiin, esimerkiksi opetuskäytttöön.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[40] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[41].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[42].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

No. All these uses can be licensed by rightsholders or via CMOs.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

No. Enabling libraries to lend sheet  music  and  recordings  electronically
would have extremely harmful effects on existing commercial services.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[43].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[44].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [48].

The Marrakesh Treaty[49] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the

specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[50] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[51].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[52]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[53].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


No. There have not been significant problems. The so-called  UGC  is  mostly
just a way to use pre-existing works. It is not a new,  unaddressed  market,
it is the broadening of the synchronisation  market  that  music  publishers
already have licensing solutions for. UGC  as  a  way  to  use  pre-existing
works is a form of derivative works, and there are  licensing  solutions  to
deal with this. Music publishers have  been  engaging  in  discussions  with
CMOs and users to develop guidelines to  facilitate  and  standardise  small
scale licensing. This has happened for example in Finland, where Teosto  and
its rightsholders have jointly created  easy-to-use  small  scale  licensing
models. The current copyright acquis is equipped to deal with UGC.


Ei. Merkittäviä ongelmia ei  ole  ilmennyt.  Niin  kutsuttu  User  Generated
Content on usein vain yksi tapa muiden joukossa käyttää jo  olemassa  olevia
teoksia. Se  ei  ole  uusi,  tunnistamaton  alue,  vaan  laajennus  olemassa
olevaan synkronoinnin alueeseen, johon  on  olemassa  valmiita  lisensointi-
malleja. Olemassa olevia teoksia käyttävät  UGC-teokset  ovat  jälkiperäisiä
teoksia,    ja    musiikin    käyttöä     niihin     osataan     lisensoida.
Musiikinkustantajat,  tekijät,  tekijänoikeusjärjestöt  ja  käyttäjät   ovat
yhdessä    luoneet    toimintamalleja    pienimuotoiselle    lisensoinnille.
Helppokäyttöisiä   malleja   on   kehitetty   myös   Suomessa   Teoston   ja
oikeudenhaltijoiden       yhteistyöllä.        Nykyinen        tekijänoikeus
lisensointimalleineen taipuu hyvin UGC:n lisensointiin.

      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


No. Licensing solutions  have  been  developed  to  ensure  that  works  are
properly identified. Legislative intervention is not needed.

käyttävät toisten teoksia korvauksetta.

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


There are no problems that cannot be solved by already  developed  licensing
solutions.  Authors  and  those  who  invest  in  their  work  expect   that
derivative works can be monetised. An exception for  UGC  would  cut  across
the rightsholders’ ability to licence and generate revenue. The  EU  has  an
efficient  and  working  copyright  system  with  defined  limitations   and
exceptions and provides a balance between flexibility and  legal  certainty.
Any measure on UGC would also have to include  an  increased  liability  for
ISPs. There are more websites dedicated to the creation  of  UGC  and  these
websites go beyond just ‘hosting’ and can no longer  avoid  liability  under
Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive.


Kaikki kysymykset ovat  ratkaistavissa  jo  olemassa  olevilla  lisensointi-
malleilla. Tekijöillä ja niillä, jotka  investoivat  heidän  teoksiinsa,  on
oikeus hyötyä taloudellisesti teostensa jälkiperäiskäytöstä.  UGC:n  salliva
poikkeus veisi heiltä mahdollisuuden lisensoida  teoksiaan  ja  saada  siitä
korvausta.  EU:n  toimiva  tekijänoikeusjärjestelmä  tarkoin   määriteltyine
rajoituksineen  ja  poikkeuksineen  takaa  joustavuuden  ja  oikeusvarmuuden
välisen  tasapainon.  Kaiken  UGC:tä  koskevan  sääntelyyn  tulisi  sisältyä
nykyistä  suurempi   vastuu   palveluntarjoajille.   Monet   palvelut   ovat
keskittyneet UGC:n tekemiseen, eikä niiden  roolina  selvästikään  ole  enää
pelkkä hosting. Tällaiset palvelut ovat  vastuullisia  toimijoita  sähköistä
kaupankäyntiä koskevan Artiklan 14 nojalla.



  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[54]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[55][56].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[57]  in
      the digital environment?

No. There is no need for further clarification  as  it  is  currently  under
review by the CJEU and at  national  level.  The  CJEU  has  confirmed  that
rightsholders  have  a  right  to  be  compensated  for   harm   caused   by
reproduction by consumers. The Court has  made  it  clear  that  the  levies
should be calculated according to the assumed harm  and  gives  guidance  on
practical implementation of levies  both  nationally  and  in  cross  border
trade.

Ei. Euroopan yhteisön tuomioistuin tutkii asiaa parhaillaan, joten
lisäselvennystä ei tarvita. Tuomioistuin on vahvistanut oikeudenhaltijoiden
oikeuden korvaukseen menetyksistä, joita yksityinen kopiointi on
aiheuttanut. Oikeuden mukaan maksujen tulee perustua aiheutettuihin
menetyksiin, ja oikeus on myös antanut ohjeita siitä, miten maksut tulee
käytännössä toteuttaa sekä kansallisesti että rajat ylittävässä kaupassa.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[58]

Yes. Justification for PCL exists  as  consumers  now  have  more  recording
devices and equipment than ever before.

Kyllä. Tämä on perusteltua, koska kuluttajilla on käytössään  tallentamiseen
sopivia laitteita ja välineitä.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Levies are in place to compensate authors and creators for the  harm  caused
by reproductions by consumers, especially in  the  digital  age  where  each
copy is a perfect representation of the original, and  an  unlimited  number
of copies can be made. However, the licensing of  the  work  is  always  the
preferred option and there is no justification for a new  exception  if  the
activities are licensable and in some cases already licensed.


Maksujen tarkoituksena on korvata tekijöille  menetykset,  joita  yksityinen
kopiointi aiheuttaa, erityisesti nyt, kun  jokainen  digitaalinen  kopio  on
alkuperäisen  täydellinen  toisinto  ja  näiden   toisintojen   kappalemäärä
rajoittamaton.  Lisensointi  on  kuitenkin  tavoiteltavin  tapa  luvallistaa
teosten käyttö, eikä yhdestäkään  uudesta  poikkeuksesta  tule  säätää,  jos
käyttö on lisensoitavissa tai joissakin tapauksissa jo lisensoitu.

  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[59]

Yes. It would be transparent and stop avoidance of payment.


Kyllä. Läpinäkyvyys lisäisi maksuhalukkuutta.


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[60].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

No. The situation of cross border transactions under  the  levy  is  overall
well managed. For any problems, there is a refund system in  place  in  most
EU Member States. The levy should be paid in the EU Member State  where  the
sale takes place or where the end user resides.

Ei. Maksun hallinnointi rajat ylittävässä kaupassa toimii hyvin. Ongelma-
tilanteita varten on useimmissa jäsenmaissa palautusjärjestelmät;
esimerkiksi Suomessa tehtävää hoitaa Teoston hyvitysmaksuyksikkö. Maksu
tulisi saattaa voimaan siinä maassa, missä myynti tapahtuu tai loppuasiakas
asuu.

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


A  study  should  be  commissioned  concerning  the  status  quo   and   the
disparities in the national Member States on the  products  levied  and  the
methods of calculating the levies between EU Member States. Following  this,
attempts should be made to harmonise  these  regulations.  Both  systems  of
regulations  should  be  subject  to  regular  reviews  to  keep  pace  with
technological developments.


Komission teettämä selvitys nykytilanteesta olisi tarpeellinen.  Sen  tulisi
kartoittaa  jäsenmaittain  eroavuudet,   jotka   koskevat   maksun   alaisia
tuotteita, sekä  tavat,  joilla  maksun  suuruus  määritellään.  Selvityksen
jälkeen  tavoitteena  tulisi  olla  käytäntöjen  harmonisointi.   Määräysten
säännöllinen tarkastelu on  välttämätöntä,  jotta  sääntely  pysyy  teknisen
kehityksen tasalla.


   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[61] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[62]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

Creators deserve fair remuneration  from  the  services.  The  best  way  to
ensure that authors and composers are fairly remunerated for their  work  is
to  have  effective  copyright  systems  and  effective  measures   on   IPR
enforcement, and to guarantee for them the freedom to grant their rights  to
the representative of their choice (a CMO, a publisher or any  third  party)
in a pro-competitive environment.


Tekijöiden tulee saada riittävä korvaus teostensa käyttämisestä  erilaisissa
palveluissa. Paras tapa huolehtia tästä on toimiva  ja  tekijöiden  oikeudet
turvaava tekijänoikeusjärjestelmä sekä tae siitä, että tekijöillä on  vapaus
luovuttaa oikeuksiensa hallinnointi valitsemalleen  taholle  (tekijänoikeus-
järjestölle,  kustantajalle  tai  jollekin  muulle)  kilpailua   edistävässä

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[63] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[64].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[65]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[66].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

Yes. The current system is extremely slow and burdensome for  rightsholders.
Further, differentiating between profit and  not  for  profit  violates  the
principles in the Three  Step  Test  that  infringement  can  prejudice  the
legitimate interests of the rightsholder without leading to financial  gains
for the  infringer.  It  should  be  possible  to  interrupt  all  kinds  of
infringements, not just those with clear commercial purpose.

Kyllä.   Nykyinen   järjestelmä   on    äärimmäisen    hidas    ja    työläs
oikeudenhaltijoille.   Katsomme   myös,    että    jaottelu    kaupallisessa
tarkoituksessa  toimiviin  ja  muihin  rikkojiin  on  kolmen  kohdan  testin
vastainen,  koska  oikeudenhaltijan  etuja  voi  loukata  myös   hankkimatta
taloudellisia etuja itselleen.  Lainsäädännöllä  on  mahdollistettava  nopea
puuttuminen kaikkiin rikkomuksiin, ei ainoastaan niihin,  joiden  takana  on
toimijan oma taloudellinen hyötymistarkoitus.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

No. It is not sufficiently clear and should  be  changed.  The  EU  requires
effective  rules  that  impose  clear  obligations   on   ISPs   and   other
intermediaries to cooperate with  rightsholders  in  IPR  enforcement.  Most
ISPs are large companies and as such gatekeepers of the Internet.  The  vast
majority of music publishers are small and medium size companies, and it  is
therefore unrealistic to suppose that they  and  individual  creators  could
have the resources to deal with all unlicensed  uses  of  their  copyrighted
content across all providers. Voluntary solutions are being developed in  EU
Member States but more must  be  done,  such  as  ISPs  sending  educational
messages to infringers and warn them that refusal to cease  infringing  will
result in meaningful consequences such as access-blocking.


Ei. Se kaipaa  selkeyttämistä.  EU  edellyttää  tehokkaita  sääntöjä,  jotka
velvoittavat palveluntarjoajat ja  muut  välittäjät  toimimaan  yhteistyössä
oikeudenhaltijoiden   kanssa.   Useimmat   palveluntarjoajat   ovat   suuria
yhtiöitä,  joilla  on  asemansa  ansiosta  mahdollisuus  toimia   Internetin
portinvartijoina.   Musiikinkustantajat   ovat   enimmäkseen    pieniä    ja
keskisuuria   yhtiöitä,   joilla   ei    ole    resursseja    puuttua    eri
palveluntarjoajien sivuilla tapahtuvaan teosten luvattomaan  käyttöön.  Sama
koskee yksittäisiä tekijöitä..


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?
Yes. The current framework does ensure that the right balance  is  achieved.
However, there are inconsistencies in the implementation by  the  EU  Member
States. Rightsholders may find it difficult to  prove  infringement  without
the information they are seeking under the right of information. We ask  for
confirmation that gathering and processing IP addresses for the purposes  of
collecting evidence of infringement is not in violation of EU Law.
Kyllä. Nykyinen sääntelykehys takaa riittävän  tasapainon.  Eri  jäsenmaiden
täytäntöönpanossa on kuitenkin ongelmia.  Oikeudenhaltijoiden  on  joissakin
tapauksissa vaikea saada tietoa, jota  he  tarvitsevat  voidakseen  todistaa
tapahtuneen oikeuksien loukkauksen. Tarvitaan koko  EU:n  kattava  vahvistus
sille, että yhteystietojen keräämine ja käsittely  tällaiseen  tarkoitukseen
ei ole vastoin EU-lainsäädäntöä.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

No. It is unclear how such a title would work, if it were  to  be  voluntary
or mandatory. Any idea of creating a new European Copyright law  that  would
replace existing national laws should be  very  thoroughly  examined  as  it
would also have the effect of removing  EU  Member  States’  flexibility  to
implement their own cultural values. If  it  were  to  be  voluntary  it  is
unlikely to be taken up by EU Member States as it would just duplicate  laws
all ready in place and increase confusion.


Ei.  Olisi  hyvin  epäselvää,  miten  se  toimisi;  olisiko  se  esimerkiksi
vapaaehtoinen  vai  pakollinen.  Koko  yhteisön  kattava   yhtenäinen   laki
poistaisi  jäsenmaiden  paikallisiin  kulttuureihin   ja   niiden   arvoihin
perustuvan  nykyisen  lainsäädännön  joustavuuden.  Jos   järjestely   olisi
vapaaehtoinen, sen täytäntöönpano jäsenmaissa olisi hyvin  epätodennäköistä,
koska se vain kaksinkertaistaisi lainsäädännön ja aiheuttaisi hämmennystä.




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


No. The fact that the Commission has been considering this  idea  for  three
years since its 2010 Reflective Paper but has not initiated any  legislation
demonstrates that this should not be the way  forward.  We  do  not  believe
that this huge task would provide any real benefits.


Ei. Jo se tosiseikka, että komissio on harkinnut tätä ajatusta  jo  vuodesta
2010 sen johtamatta lainsäädäntöprosessiin, on  osoitus  siitä,  ettei  tämä
ole oikea tie eteenpäin. Tehtävä olisi valtava, emmekä usko  siitä  koituvan
todellista hyötyä.


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[27] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
