Public Consultation
on the review of the EU copyright rules

PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:
Name: Thomas Godfrey Gardner

TYPE OF RESPONDENT
 End user/consumer
 Author/Performer

1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
         YES News reports and performances are not available, for no apparent reason.

4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?

       YES. Sorting out rights is prohibitively expensive for individual authors and small
       businesses. This unfairly favours the formation of large cartels.

5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
         NO

7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
        YES Single EU harmonisation of the rules will level the playing field and make
        individuals/businesses more competitive.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

       NO Absolutely not. If the rightsholder doesn't want their content to be seen then either they
       shouldn't publish or they should bear the costs of enforcing their rights. Externalising the
       costs onto other businesses and individuals is unfair, anti-competitive and reduces
       competitiveness.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
        NO Absolutely not. This would imply that the WWW infrastructure is illegal!

13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
       YES Ebooks and software application/programmes. If I buy some products and store them
       on one computer in one country, they cannot be accessed if I take that computer to a
       different country. This inhibits my freedom of movement.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
        YES

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
       It would create simple certainty and remove ambiguity.

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
       If there is a complex constantly changing “product”, such as a computer program, the
       system could be overwhelmed by a myriad of small changes every time the program is
       improved.

18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
       Simplicity and certainty are sufficient incentive

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
       Ensure mechanisms are sufficient for “products” where there are a large number of
       individual authors and the product is constantly evolving. Example: open source software
       such as the GNU/Linux operating system, or applications such as LibreOffice.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
        YES Variations for fair use, parody, citation, reporting, science and education.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
        YES Fair use, parody, citation, reporting, science and education should be harmonised

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
        YES Remove restrictions related to fair use, parody, citation, reporting, science and
        education

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
        YES Remove restrictions related to fair use, parody, citation, reporting, science and
        education

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
        YES prohibitively complex and expensive for individual authors and small businesses

36. (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
        YES e-book became “unavailable” because it had been read more than an arbitrary number
        of times

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
          If a a person or institution buys a book they should own it, not rent it.

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
        NO. Periodically purchasers need to transfer objects they have purchased from one computer
        to a replacement computer.

72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
         Do not permit “rights grabs” where a large business claims copyright on my work because
         “it hasn't been able to locate the rights holder”

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
        NO If my personal data is used or released without my explicit permission then the
        organisation should be liable for all consequential costs and penalties, without limit.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
        YES

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
        YES Organisations that incorrectly claim copyright should be subject to severe penalties,
        especially if they haven't adequately checked whether copyright is infringed. Anything less
        is a chilling restriction on freedom of expression.
