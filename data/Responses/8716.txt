Public Consultation on the Review of EU Copyright Rules

FINNMEDIA (The Federation of the Finnish Media Industry / Viestinnän Keskusliitto VKL)
expresses its thanks for the opportunity to make a submission to the European Commission on a
possible review of EU copyright rules. FINNMEDIA, answering as a federation of businesses,
respectfully presents the following. We limit our submission to the questions most relevant to
our association and the media companies we represent.



5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European coun-
tries)?

Yes. In some situations a rights-holder may need the protection that regulation offers in order to
be able to pursue profitable business operations in various territories. For example, tailoring
advertising for different audiences may presuppose the same television programmes being of-
fered on a territory-specific basis. In addition, the variation in national rules on defamation,
libel, consumer law and for example rights of persons interviewed in the media, makes it neces-
sary to tailor media content for different Member States.

7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availa-
bility of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

No. The existing regulations are no obstacle to cross-border licensing. Licences must continue to
be based on freedom to conclude contracts. By contrast, development must be focused on tools
to facilitate management of cross-border rights.

8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
                                                  Response                              2 (8)




Yes. It will be better if application in situations of re-use continues to be done on the Member
State level.

9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right
have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered
to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your
rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
the availability of injunctive relief)?

Yes. The adoption of a clearer country-of-origin principle would make implementation of rights
more difficult and lead to a lowering of the level of protection afforded them. This would lessen
willingness to invest in digital content.

10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

No. The market will steer concentration of rights to one actor to the extent that this is necessary.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

Yes in certain situations. There is no need for a regulation requiring the right-holder’s permis-
sion for incidental and non-commercial linking to the Internet location of material. By contrast,
services based on systematic commercial linking, in which the content is chosen primarily by the
service provider rather than the service user, require the author’s permission. Using importing
links to make works a part of one’s own service do, however, likewise require the author’s per-
mission and are licensable.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduc-
tion of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen
and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under spe-
cific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

Yes in certain situations, or more precisely when what is involved is not a temporary copy that is
technically necessary in order to produce a service, but rather an independent service that sub-
stitutes for recorded material that is offered, sold or rented to users.

14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of
content) concerned.

Applying the principle of expiry of copyright to digital material would be unreasonable, because
a digital good does not wear out, but when used second-hand is identical with a new corre-
sponding good. For these reasons a digital secondary market would seriously threaten the pri-
mary market for digital content production. It would not be worthwhile for consumers to buy an
original product or service if a completely equivalent good was available more cheaply on the
secondary market. The value chain that engenders new products would wither, the price of new
                                                 Response                             3 (8)




products would increase and jobs would disappear from the creative sector. This development
would not be to consumers’ advantage, either.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identifica-
tion and licensing of works and other subject matter?
16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

If such a system were put in place, it would absolutely have to be voluntary. The existing prohi-
bition on formality-related requirements in the existing copyright system has a clear efficiency
advantage.


19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of
rights ownership and permissions databases?

The Union should continue to support the systems that are being developed in the market. RDI
is a good example. There is no need to intervene in the matter through regulation.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

Yes. The digital environment does not in itself provide a reason for changing the terms of pro-
tection in either direction.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

No. The Union’s regulatory framework must be sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of
the Member States’ different cultural and political value bases.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

No. Harmonisation of exceptions will presumably not promote creative production in Europe.
Also in this respect, the Union’s regulation of copyright must be sufficiently flexible.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

No. Problems mostly lie in purposeful use of the existing exceptions. At present, there is no evi-
dence of situations in which either the market or the exceptions already in force would not make
it possible for works to be used. The impact of limitations and exceptions would be especially
devastating in minor language and cultural regions, where the profitability of investments in
content would be more directly jeopardised if copyright markets were restricted to a smaller
size.
                                                  Response                              4 (8)




24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions?

No. The existing degree of flexibility is purposeful and adequate.

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, con-
stitute a problem?

No. Within the framework of the volumes of cross-border licensing, national copyright terms are
relatively unproblematic to take into consideration.

28. (b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational es-
tablishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We have not. It is nevertheless important that copyright protection will continue to be safe-
guarded also in library, educational, museum and archive use above all in a way that ensures
that use does not jeopardise the primary market for the works. Rights-holders must also be
compensated for use. Direct licensing is the best solution to the problems. It is also important
that the Member States ensure that libraries, the educational sector, museums and archives ob-
tain sufficient resources to procure copyright-protected content. The role of publicly funded
institutions shall not be extended in a manner to create new competition to copyright-based
production.

32. (c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those
institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or
other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private
study?
33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The copyright organisations have already co-piloted licences for remote access and the publish-
ers are conducting further discussions of the matter in a good spirit. The existing copyright sys-
tem facilitates licensing of services of this kind well and we are not aware of any particular prob-
lems.

36. (c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend
books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Negotiations on the matter are getting under way. The existing copyright system facilitates li-
censing of services of this kind well and we are not aware of any particular problems.

39. What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as
on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises
(online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you en-
countered?
                                                  Response                              5 (8)




Applying the principle of expiry of copyright to digital items would not be reasonable but rather
a blow on the very core of copyright protection. Licensing of electronic modes of mediation is
possible within the framework of the existing copyright system.

40. Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and col-
lecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be
accessed across the EU?

No. A digital archive is a business opportunity for publishers and actors in the audiovisual sector
and should not be endangered by competing public services.

42. (b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?
43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

No, insofar as it refers to illustration in its actual, narrow meaning. Duplicating works for vari-
ous technical teaching platforms and mediating them on the Internet requires the permission of
the rights-holder. The concept may presuppose explication that an exception is not applicable
more broadly than its purpose. The educational sector is a very important market for the pub-
lishing sector. In the Nordic countries, there are also very well-functioning, adequately limited
and controlled models for extended collective licenses for educational purposes.

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?


The copyright organisations offer licences for scanning, photocopying, use in connection with
digital teaching platforms and distance learning in order to facilitate the use of content in teach-
ing. Newspaper and book publishers are collaborating with schools within several media educa-
tion projects.

47. (b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used in the context of research pro-
jects/activities, including across borders?

No. The matter can be resolved by means of licensing.

49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content
for research purposes? How successful are they?

Publishers have at their disposal well-functioning tailored licensing mechanisms for research
institutions, including inter alia collective licences offered through collective administration
organisations.

50. (c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of
limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works
published in special formats, including across borders?
                                                 Response                             6 (8)




No. Existing regulation of copyright regulates reasonable adjustments well. It is important that a
service for special groups does not impose an undue burden on content producers nor jeopard-
ise the benefits derived from copyright rights in other market segments.

53. (c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and
data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

No. The copyright system does not in its present form pose obstacles to data mining and also
commercial use is licensable if necessary. It is, however, important to ensure that activities re-
main, through licensing, manageable in a way that ensures that the end product does not dam-
age the primary market for content production.

58. (c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are us-
ing pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the
Internet, including across borders?

No. We have been able to resolve problems by, inter alia, developing licence types. Publishers
have actively participated in digital distribution and interactive content production together
with readers.

59. (a) Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online
use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?

There have not been problems. Our own systems have been adequate and good tools are also
available for new publication actors.


64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and applica-
tion of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environ-
ment?

No. The area of application is defined clearly enough. It is important that contract licences are
limited to situations in which direct licensing is not possible.

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licenced by rightholders, and where the harm to the
rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

The matter can be decided on in each Member State. As the Court of Justice has outlined in a
judgement (-C460/11 C-457/11), a limitation of copyright does not in itself exclude the possibil-
ity of reasonable compensation. However, legislation must not lead to a double charge for the
same use.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have cop-
ies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
                                                 Response                              7 (8)




Copies made for various devices are licensable within the framework of the existing system.
Something more problematic is the above-mentioned direct reproduction facilitated by cloud
services, and by means of which copies made for the user are compensated for (See question 12).


73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts?

No. Questions concerning reasonable terms and conditions, including prices, must be resolved
on the level of the Member States’ contract law. The a priori requirement is for freedom of con-
tract and established business practices in national copyright markets. Pan-European uniform
criteria can not be applied to the question.


75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Yes. To support the legal Internal Market, it is essential to make measures against illegal content
more effective by making intervention in cases of rights infringements less expensive and faster.
The responsibility status of content aggregators likewise needs to be explicated.


76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for suffi-
cient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertis-
ing brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibit-
ing online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

Service providers should cooperate better than at present to prevent copyright infringements,
but they must not become the primary monitors of message contents. Balances between copy-
right rights and freedom of speech must be struck by a court of law.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights
such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Yes. A more precise balance is best found on the level of the Member State.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a
means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copy-
right across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does
the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this
is a longer term project?

No. For the reasons mentioned in the foregoing, the Union’s copyright system must be flexible
with respect to the systems in the Member States.
