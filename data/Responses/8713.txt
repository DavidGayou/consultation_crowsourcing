I. Access to your content across Europe


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other  than  the
one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)





€ NO





€ NO OPINION





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.


[Open question]


As a right  holder  we  are  not  often  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
licences. We have to grant lots of rights (paperback, pocket,  ebook,  audio
etc.).  We have had over 400 deals and  I  guess  3%  of  them  were  multi-
territorial licences


5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to  certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


We try not to sell the rights to the English language world.


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain





€ NO – Please explain








€ NO OPINION





8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations
– i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?





€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])







€ NO OPINION




9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right  have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an  author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or  not),
on your remuneration,  or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief[2])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





4. Download to own digital content


14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please  specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


We do not intend to allow to re-sale our ebooks.


I. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


Not a problem


€ NO OPINION


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why








€ NO – Please explain why


The current wording is flexible enough.


€ NO OPINION



26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to








€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


As a publishing house we have not noticed problems


€ NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of  “fair
compensation”  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part   of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

No problem with us I guess. We have agreements  with  other  publishers  who
issue their editions of our books. We have agreements  so  we  know  who  is
paying whom

Access to content in libraries and archives


Preservation and archiving

28. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or

question.








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Off-premises access to library collections



32.  (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]



We have not negotiated such agreements


E – lending


36. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION



Teaching

42.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

The educational publishers contact us when they want to use our text or
ilustrations. They pay us directly



Research


47.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?


Disabilities


50.  (c) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





52. What mechanisms exist in the market place  to  facilitate  accessibility
to content? How successful are they?

Text and data mining

53. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain





€ NO OPINION


55. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]


57.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]





User-generated content


58. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





€ NO


€ NO OPINION


59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing  works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?


€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


.





€ NO OPINION






II. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain why


All depends on the agreement between the author and publisher.  However  the
regulations in Poland are ok


€ NO OPINION



 III. Respect for rights

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


We are generally satisfied with the current legislation, but there is  still
room for improvement.


Publishers could benefit from a “presumption  of  ownership”  based  on  the
assignation of rights by their authors. This  would  help  them  to  have  a
“locus standi” to be able to take legal action against  infringers.  We  are
not in favour of  taking  action  against  individuals,  but  would  support
targeting illegal websites.


Websites which infringe copyright may seem “non-commercial”, but  there  are
frequently signs that these sites are in fact making a  considerable  amount
of money (e.g. advertising).


€ NO – Please explain











€ NO OPINION


76. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
for sufficient involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

We would find it beneficial if  some  intermediaries  such  as  advertisers,
payment services, domain name registrars  and  search  engines  who  benefit
from pirate websites and piracy in general would be encouraged to  cooperate
more in efforts to stop illegal activities.


77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain





€ NO OPINION

-----------------------
[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[2] Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the  right
holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
