II.       Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


DIGITALEUROPE welcomes the opportunity to respond to this public consultation on the
review of the EU copyright rules.

The world of copyrighted content has changed radically in the past decade thanks to the
modern infrastructure and the new technologies provided by digital industries, to the benefit
of artists and consumers alike. However, the fragmented copyright systems in Europe have
not adapted to new trends in the creation, distribution and consumption of copyrighted
content. Whilst we do not believe that there is a need for a fundamental reassessment of the
current copyright regime, there is however a need to modernise certain aspects of the
copyright rules in order to make them relevant in today’s digital environment.
DIGITALEUROPE welcomes this opportunity to constructively present its views for a
copyright regime fit for the digital age.

DIGITALEUROPE wishes to comment particularly on the questions related to exceptions
and limitations in the Single Market, and especially the issue of private copying and
reprography levies. Over the past decade, the Commission has organised several
consultations (in 2006, 2008 and 2012) which helped gather a significant body of evidence
relating to the operation of copyright levy systems in Europe. In the meantime, no real
reform has taken place to address the copyright levy system which remains inefficient, non-
transparent, and highly dysfunctional. It is regrettable that the publication of the
Recommendations on private copying and reprography levies by Antonio Vitorino, which
sought to bring solutions in the short term, was not followed by the application of these
recommendations through concrete measures.

Also, the multiplication of litigation cases both at the national and European levels in recent
years illustrates the need to act and reform the broken system of copyright levies.

Moreover, the growing disparity in the way that levies are set up, collected and distributed
denies European technology providers the legal certainty that they require to effectively
operate in what is supposed to be the European Single Market. The proliferation of copyright
levies to more devices and the prohibitive levels of levies demanded in many cases, increase
the cost of technology for European consumers.

We hope that the European Commission will seize the opportunity to propose reforms to the
private copying levy systems in the Single Market as transitional measures toward the
ultimate phase out of levies and the development of alternative compensation mechanisms
more in line with modern consumer expectations and behaviour.




                                                                                              4
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?


1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?


YES


Today, EU citizens can travel and work anywhere within the EU, however the Digital Single
Market for content remains an aspiration.
• DIGITALEUROPE’s members have an interest in a rich and vibrant market for online
content, as they work hard to offer as many services and devices as possible which are
designed to get access to many online content services from anywhere in Europe.
• However, content licensing does not always allow all content to reach such devices across
Member States. For example, limitation of access (e.g. geoblocking) results from the service
provider/right owner's decision.


For instance, in the context of Connected TV, it should be noted that many applications which
appear within a smart device are 100% authored by the application owner (e.g. a public
broadcaster) and that any logic that is applied within this application to restrict content access
is completely determined by the application author and completely out of the control of the
device manufacturer.
Geoblocking control is applied at the server side – e.g. BBC content servers (not the device)
determine that iPlayer content shall not be served to devices outside the UK. While such a
state of affairs exists, it would be pointless for the manufacturer to display the iPlayer app on
a device in Germany, as this would only confuse and annoy consumers. Note that geo-
blocking is mostly applied as consequence of the limitations of rights. We encourage the
Commission to maintain its commitment to work towards a modern framework for copyright,
in line with the issues raised and the responses made to the COM(2011) 427 consultation.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?


Obtaining rights for content is typically a lengthy, time-consuming and costly exercise,
especially since it is generally licensed on a country by country basis. We therefore encourage
the Commission to maintain its commitment to work towards a modern framework for
copyright licensing, in line with the issues raised and the responses made to the COM(2011)
427 consultation. In order to facilitate a more efficient rights clearance system the EU should
continue its efforts in support of the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) on which many
companies and rightholders have spent much time and effort in recent years. The EU should


                                                                                                5
also explore possibilities that would allow the licensing rights for global content to be
available from one source and for all EU Member States.
While we believe the market is currently represented by a healthy plurality of market players
and competition between them, various challenges and obstacles to online content distribution
still remain. Some approaches that could be used to address them would be to evaluate the
correct balance of how exclusive licensing is used, particularly in combination with other
factors including market dominance in the value chain, and to avoid monopoly, de-facto
monopoly, dominance, network effects or other technical barriers that could lead to
distortions of the market.
We also urge the Commission to consider various on-going market developments seeing to
improve online content distribution. Innovative approaches e.g. e-Publishing, online gaming,
and premium video content distribution through efforts including UltraViolet, are striving to
meet the needs of rightholders and users by creating flexible and customisable product
offerings.
Overall, we see these new business models still emerging, without any clear indication of how
they will evolve nor if they will succeed. Any new regulation that is considered to protect
traditional and increasingly obsolete business models must not hinder the emergence and
development of new technologies. For further details, please see the DIGITALEUROPE
response to the Commission’s public consultation on the Green Paper on Convergence (Qs 2
& 3).



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?


YES
DIGITALEUROPE believes that the simultaneous application of the rights of reproduction
and communication to the public (Art. 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC) to single acts of
economic exploitation is legally questionable and economically unsuitable because of the
uncertainties and transaction costs it raises whenever content has to be licensed for digital
content services, usage and deliveries. The EU Digital Single Market would greatly benefit
from the implementation of a single right of digital exploitation, which should replace the
archaic distinction between acts of reproduction and communication that, on digital networks,
are technically blurred. Art. 3.2 of Directive 2001/29/EC already provides for a right of
making content available to the public on demand (within the scope of the existing
communication right), that was expressly created for the purpose of re-stating and adapting
copyright protection to the digital environment. In our view, in this legal framework it is hard
to understand why digital acts (e.g. acts of digital content transmission) should legally depend
on clearance of two separate rights. We believe that a single digital exploitation right should
legally absorb the rights of communication to the public (including the making available

                                                                                              6
right) and reproduction when copyright content is transmitted over networks or via digital
devices, independently of whether digital services provide for content streams, downloads
and/or transfers.


From our perspective, the simultaneous implementation of the rights of reproduction and
communication to the public creates problems since it makes the crucial distinction between
licensed content services and unauthorised copying of lawfully accessed content very unclear.
This is the distinction that national lawmakers and authorities have to rely on while assessing
the harm stemming from unauthorised private copying and determining fair compensation for
copyright holders under national levy systems. The implementation of a single digital
exploitation right would clarify and strengthen the principle that no private copying exception
is applicable to digital content, whether inter alia content is delivered to or consumed by
consumers in the context of licensed digital services (including downloading services) or
otherwise.




3.     Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?


NO


The provision of a hyperlink does not amount to the transmission of an actual work, which is
a necessary condition for the consideration of a communication to the public. Secondly, it
does not amount to an act of communication to a new public.
The CJEU recently confirmed in its judgment in case of Svensson and Others v Retriever
Sverige AB (C-466/12) that the provision of hyperlinks to works protected under copyright
which are already available does not infringe copyright.
Generally speaking, any trend associating this type of provision with copyright infringement
is not desirable for the future development of the digital economy and the modernisation of
copyright.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


NO

                                                                                               7
The viewing of a webpage which would imply the temporary reproduction of copyright
protected content should not be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. Any change
towards a more restrictive approach makes no sense at all in the digital age.
Such temporary reproductions are not considered to be copies other than temporary and are
exempted from the reproduction right in Directive 2001/29, Article 5.1. There is no need to
modify this rule.
It must also be noted that the UK Supreme Court delivered a judgment on this issue on 17
April 2013 in Case NLA v. PRCA and found that temporary copies made in an end-user's
browser cache and on the screen when simply viewing the content of a web page are
exempted from copyright infringement by the temporary copies exception of Directive
2001/29. This point has been referred to the CJEU for a preliminary reference.




4.     Download to own digital content


14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


Regarding the resale of computer programs distributed online, the judgment of the CJEU in
C-128/11 on the resale of second-hand computer programs is potentially damaging to
rightholders, creates confusion in the marketplace and is inconsistent in many aspects.
We caution that the statement in footnote 28 of the consultation document quoted below is
overly broad and does not reflect important limitations with respect to exhaustion as specified
in the judgment. The judgment established a number of conditions (such as the destruction of
copies of the computer program licensed to the original licensee) which must be met prior to
any potential exhaustion of the distribution right with respect to computer programs.
Footnote 28 reads “…an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand license that allows
downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited period of
time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a
license is exhausted on its first sale”.
Nevertheless, even taking into account such limitations as outlined in the judgment, the
judgment is damaging to the interests of rightholders and licensees alike. For instance,
questions are raised regarding the enforceability of certain conditions included in license
agreements for downloaded software. As an example, educational institutions will often
benefit from favourable licensing terms and conditions not available to other entities under
“educational licenses”. If, as a result of the judgment, such educational institutions are
permitted to dismiss field of use restrictions in their license agreements and “resell” their
license to entities outside of the sector not eligible for “educational licenses”, rightholders will
no longer be in a position to offer such favourable licensing terms and conditions to the
education sector.



                                                                                                  8
Moreover, the CJEU judgment contradicts Commission Report 199 Final on the
Implementation and Effects of Directive 91/250/EEC on the Legal Protection of Computer
Programs (April 2000) and the Commission’s pleadings before the CJEU in case C-128/11
where the Commission argues that all copyrighted works including computer programs are
subject to the principle that online service provision of copyrighted works does not entail
exhaustion of the distribution right. The CJEU judgment, applicable only to computer
programs, therefore introduces an entirely arbitrary and unintended by the policy maker
distinction between different categories of copyrighted works whereby computer programs
are subject to exhaustion when distributed online while other copyrighted works such as e-
books, music or films are not subject to exhaustion.
Digital files are not the same as tangible goods. For instance, in contrast to physical goods, the
“transfer” of a digital work does not necessarily mean that the original holder of the work has
relinquished possession of it. An analogue application of the offline world to the online world
would create significant confusion and legal uncertainty in the market. It has negative impact
on the ability of rightholders to enforce their intellectual property rights and to develop
innovative licensing models with various pricing models meeting user needs and
particularities. It would also impact the ability to provide post sale services (i.e. software
patches, backup copies etc.).




D.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?


DIGITALEUROPE would like to ask clarification on identifiers specifically considering the
potential impact on designing devices and systems which handle relevant content. As a
general matter, technical methods for self-identification require assistance by devices and
systems either positively - detection and reaction, or passively - no interference.
DIGITALEUROPE remains at the Commission’s disposal to provide technical details on
identifiers.




E.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?


We would question any further extension of current terms of copyright protection, and any
extension must be based on economic arguments. There is a need to keep the balance between
the protection of creation and investment, and the access to public domain.

                                                                                                9
III.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

DIGITALEUROPE wishes to make a general comment on this section on limitations and
exceptions in the Single Market, which will cover the most important questions raised in this
section of the consultation.

On the question of the optional/mandatory aspect of exceptions, we believe that the
exceptions should not be mandatory and should remain optional. Member States which
choose to implement the exceptions should have flexibility in the application thereof. In the
case of the exception for private copying, Member States should also have the possibility to
implement the exception allowing that no further compensation is due to rightholders for the
private copy if they conclude that it does not result in any significant harm.

There is a need to keep a wide degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
limitations and exceptions, which should be provided for through non-binding soft law (EC
Recommendation).

Although there are other problems created by the territoriality of limitations and exceptions,
DIGITALEUROPE considers that the most pressing issue to address concerns the exception
for private copying (see our answers in section IV).

Regarding the cross-border effect of territorial exceptions and the question of “fair
compensation”, DIGITALEUROPE would like to point out that:

• The definition of what is a “fair” compensation must be addressed. Compensation should
be based on an analysis of the actual harm caused to rightholders (see our answers to section
IV). As per recital 35 of the Copyright Directive, minimal harm should not give rise to a
claim for further compensation.

• As already mentioned, compensation should be based on an independent analysis of the
actual harm caused to rightholders. The method for calculating harm should consider the
value consumers attach to the subsequent copies they make, which refers to the economic
utility of each copy, as suggested by the European Mediator on Private Copying Levies
Antonio Vitorino.

• All decisions regarding the calculation of the fair compensation due for private copying
require the representation of all stakeholders in the process, including consumer associations.

• The compensation schemes for the private copying exception cause many problems
regarding cross-border transactions and the movement of goods. It is essential to bring
solutions to the issue of double-payments, and the European Commission should provide

                                                                                             10
guidance on how to avoid double payments in the Single Market.

• Considering the many problems caused by the implementation of compensation schemes
for the private copying exception, the European Commission should present options to
reform and simplify the system towards the abolition of device-based levies and the
development of alternative non-hardware based compensation systems.



Access to content in libraries and archives, teaching, research and disabilities

In this section, DIGITALEUROPE would like to take the opportunity to also touch upon the
issues of access to content in libraries and archives, teaching, research and disabilities. While
we welcome to articulate exceptions in those fields, it is also necessary to consider the aspect
of anti-circumvention of technological protection measures. Due to the nature of digital
content, circumvention of technological protection measures that is permitted as exceptions
can easily be used to produce many identical digital copies which may then be distributed to
millions of people without technical restriction via the internet. The essential protection
provided by a technological measure is, thus, undermined substantially or even totally by
actions that may be made in the name of an authorised exception. Accordingly, it is
necessary and appropriate for the Commission to very narrowly craft such cases for
permitting circumvention of technological protection measures, where applicable, to the level
of absolute necessity to achieve the goal.

At the same time, given the fact that WIPO is currently reviewing the issue of audiovisual
works in the context of libraries, archives and education, it is advisable for the Commission
to wait and see what conclusions WIPO will draw.




IV.       Private copying and reprography


64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?


YES

Copyright levies are completely out of tune with the realities of the digital era. Therefore
clarification of the scope and application of copyright levies is urgently needed.

Despite the fact that the copyright levy systems are inefficient, counterproductive, unfair and
opaque in the analogue environment, the scope, application and level of copyright levies
continue to increase rapidly in the digital environment. As clearly explained by Mr. Antonio
Vitorino in his report on private copying and reprography levies, copyright levies also cause
many frictions in the Single Market.


                                                                                               11
Regarding the scope of the exception, it should indeed be made very clear that licensed copies
should not trigger the application of private copying levies, that illegal copies do not fall
within the scope of the exception (and that the calculation of harm does not include illegal
copies), and the professional use is also outside of the scope.

It has to be unambiguously confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively
based on harm and therefore should only exist if there is a proven substantial harm to
rightholders. The term “harm” must be more precisely defined (see our answer to question
71).

In the absence of such clarifications on the scope and the application of the exception, the
levy system is chaotic as the current lack of legal certainty allows unlimited claims from
collecting societies leading to an unreasonable and unjustified accumulation of levies for
consumers and industry.

The lack of clarity regarding the scope and application of the exception is one of the many
problems in the levy systems which require urgent solutions. There are other prominent issues
to solve which are linked to the application of the exception, such as the calculation of tariffs,
the application of levies on copies of licensed content, the double payments in cross-border
transactions, the inefficient reimbursement systems for professional use, the lack of
transparency to consumers and the lack of monitoring of the distribution of funds.

The Commission should work with Member States to establish a roadmap for reform and the
ultimate phase out of levies systems. This reform should be based on two main steps:
• As a first step, levies systems must be reformed via transitional measures - on the basis of
Vitorino’s recommendations - to improve the current system and chart a path towards its
ultimate phase out. This could be achieved through an EU soft law instrument such as a
Recommendation.
• As a second step, levies systems should be replaced by more modern and flexible
alternative forms of compensation based on actual demonstrable harm. Member States should
be allowed complete discretion to decide which alternative system to implement.


See our answer to question 71 on the specific problems with the current functioning of the
levy system and our proposals for solutions.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?1


NO


Licensed copies should absolutely not trigger the application of private copying levies.
Mr. Vitorino rightly concludes that content licensed through online business models, e.g. legal
downloading and streaming services, should not be subject to levies (“Licensed copies should
1
 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          12
not trigger the application of levies. The opposite view would pave the way for double
payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double payments.”
A. Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies, 2013 - p.7).
As he summarises, rightholders have already received remuneration for licensed content
including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between rightholders and
users. In this respect, private copying of licensed copies does not cause any additional harm to
rightholders, therefore no extra compensation is justified. Any additional payment on top of
the amounts that were already paid as part of the license fees would be paramount to double-
payment. The current private copying system does not consider this fact and creates a
significant problem of double payment as a result. This is harming the licensing model. Also,
the CJEU confirmed in its judgment in VG Wort case C457/11 to C460/11 that compensation
is due only when harm is suffered.
Moreover, Mr. Vitorino also points out that copyright levies are not equivalent or
complementary to licensing (“I doubt that the primary function of the levy regime lies in
guaranteeing a premium that rightholders could not achieve under market conditions.” A.
Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the mediation on private copying and reprography
levies, 2013 - p.6).

Applying private copying levies to authorised copies of licensed content directly contradicts
paragraph 4 of Art.6 (4) of the Copyright Directive. In such regard, Art. 6(4) provides:

“4. Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1, in the absence of
voluntary measures taken by rightholders, including agreements between rightholders and
other parties concerned, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that
rightholders make available to the beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided for in
national law in accordance with Article 5(2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or (3)(e)
the means of benefiting from that exception or limitation, to the extent necessary to benefit
from that exception or limitation and where that beneficiary has legal access to the protected
work or subject-matter concerned.
A Member State may also take such measures in respect of a beneficiary of an exception or
limitation provided for in accordance with Article 5(2)(b), unless reproduction for private use
has already been made possible by rightholders to the extent necessary to benefit from the
exception or limitation concerned and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5(2)(b)
and (5), without preventing rightholders from adopting adequate measures regarding the
number of reproductions in accordance with these provisions.
The technological measures applied voluntarily by rightholders, including those applied in
implementation of voluntary agreements, and technological measures applied in
implementation of the measures taken by Member States, shall enjoy the legal protection
provided for in paragraph 1.
The provisions of the first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to works or other
subject-matter made available to the public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that
members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them.”

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

                                                                                              13
It would be incomprehensible to consider extending to online services a copyright levy system
which does not function in the offline world. Extending a dysfunctional system from
hardware to online services would be a major step back made by the European Union in
trying to develop a flourishing Digital Single Market.
European consumers and internet users would be the first victims of the imposition of levies
on cloud services since prices would most certainly rise because of levies. Imposing levies on
cloud services would also have negative impact on European cloud service providers, as the
obligation to pay levies added to new administrative burden would significantly limit their
competitiveness in the global market. The negative impact on new business models would be
immediate, as levies would raise prices and thus limit the attractiveness, competitiveness and
future development of business models based on new technologies. This completely
contradicts the European Commission goal and hard work over the past few years to boost
cloud take-up in Europe, which is rightfully seen as a major growth driver for the digital
economy. The EU should recognise these new trends with discussion on policies favourable
to innovation, not taxing it indiscriminately before it has even got off the ground. Imposing
levies on the cloud would contradict the ongoing initiatives of the European Commission in
line with the European Cloud Strategy and European Cloud Partnership and would only serve
to stifle what promises to be an innovative and high-growth industry.
The Vitorino report clearly indicates that attempts to broaden the interpretation of the private
copying exception are not only to the detriment of rightholders and legal offers based on
license agreements, but are also legally questionable and should not be supported.
•  Rightholders already receive compensation for licensed content including subsequent
private copies in the framework of licensing contracts between rightholders and users (see
answer to question 65). Applying the unfair copyright levy system to cloud services would
result in unjustified, unreasonable and unnecessary triple payment by consumers (for the
licensed content, for the connected device, and for the cloud service).
• It should also be noted that private copying levies are currently applied to devices which
contain a storage capacity, as it was assumed that since devices with a storage capacity can be
used to copy protected content they should all be subject to levies. In the case of access based
cloud services, storage capacity is not needed and applying levies on them is thus irrelevant.
• Furthermore, from a purely legal standpoint the temporary copies made in the context of
cloud services cannot give rise to copyright levies. Indeed, the concept of “copy” refers to the
notion of reproduction which must be treated identically under the exclusive right and under
the exception. Also the reference to the notion of “fixation” in certain Members States to
define the act of reproduction (e.g. in France), as well as the exclusion of temporary and
transient copies from the reproduction right under European Union law (now implemented in
most EU Member States) implies a duration or a longevity.
Technical or incidental copies necessary for the private display of a work - which are similar
to playing a media – are already covered by the exception of interim or transient copies which
are not compensated. Therefore, such copies cannot be considered as private and are not
eligible to compensation.
In addition, “technical” copies intended for a public performance can be “absorbed” into the
right of communication to the public and shall then not be governed by the reproduction right.
These analyses help strengthen the assumption of an exclusion of the exception of private
copying for technical copies acts in cloud computing.
                                                                                             14
• One of the main advantages of cloud services is their global nature, therefore imposing
territorial/national levy systems on global services seems unfeasible and absurd, especially
considering the principles of the Single Market.
• Cloud computing allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides artists
with new distribution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be able to access digital
content from several connected devices at all times and from anywhere.

67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?


YES


Copyright levies are in essence a hidden cost for the consumers. End users who have to pay
for private copying are in most cases not aware of the levy. It is settled case-law that the
financial burden of the compensation must be borne by the final private users, as they are the
ones who cause the harm to the rightholders by making use of the private copying exception
(CJEU judgment in Padawan vs. SGAE C-467/08, paragraph 45). An obligation to inform
final customers of the amount of the levy included in the price of the products they buy would
bring more transparency to the system and allow private users to know that a fair
compensation for the acts of private copying they might operate is included in the price of
sale of products subject to levies. The levy amount should be made visible at the point of sale
(retailer level), and the retailer should be liable to provide the information to the consumer on
the invoice.
Moreover, making the levy visible should allow final customers to ask for reimbursements in
those cases where levied products are used within the scope of the private copying exception,
and for such reimbursement to be made quickly and easily. This would make it easier and
more transparent to control payment of fair compensation by those obliged to bear such
financial burden. It would correctly allow the exoneration of levies to professional users
buying goods that would be otherwise subject to a levy, ensuring full compliance with the
CJEU judgment in Padawan vs. SGAE C-467/08.
Finally, it will also allow rightholders to easily monitor whether retailers are charging levies
at the point of selling concerned devices to consumers, and facilitate the implementation of
Mr. Vitorino’s recommendation regarding the shift of liability for paying levies from
manufacturers and importers to retailers (assuming a simplification of the current system)
which would further encourage the free movement of ICT products in the EU territory.
Regarding private copying levies, France has already published a law (Decree n° 2013-1141
of 10 December 2013) that will ensure that levies must be visible to consumers. There are also
good precedents in EU legislation for other sectors and implemented at the Member State
level, such as the WEEE Directive which allows for a visible fee to the end user regarding the
collection and recycling costs.




                                                                                              15
68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?


YES

In the current system, products can be levied when they are placed on the Internal Market or
when products – theoretically in a regime of free circulation - cross a national intra-
community border within the EU. As a consequence, products moving from one Member
State to another are levied at least twice in the majority of cross-border transactions, which
creates significant problems of double payments that should not exist in what is supposed to
be an Internal Market.

Even though mechanisms for ex-post reimbursements have been put in place in some Member
States, they are very complex, costly and time-consuming (e.g. over 1 year to obtain a refund,
which requires exporting companies to finance those levies that are reimbursed upon
exportation) for manufacturers and importers, and generally do not function. In fact, many
manufacturers and importers and especially retailers that act as exporters choose not to apply
for a reimbursement because of the lengthy and expensive administrative processes.

The territorial nature of copyright levies, the different tariffs and different scope definitions
across the EU, as well as the absence of functioning reimbursement mechanisms and the non-
application of the CJEU judgment in Padawan vs. SGAE C-467/08 in the Member States
create undue payments and double payments.


Also, the different definitions of intra-community importer among the Member States are
another source of complications (see CJEU judgment on Opus - C-462/09 and judgment of
the French Cour de Cassation in case “Rue du Commerce v. Dabs” 2008), which justifies the
need for copyright levies to be paid in the country of destination.


Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue payments.

There are a number of readily available resources that provide significant market data. In
particular we suggest the Commission consults with IDC which has a proven track record of
providing independent and objective data and analysis of the ICT and consumer technology
market.


Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes could help
to remedy the situation.

Sales to professional users must be excluded from private copying levy schemes. Users that
do not benefit from the exception cannot be requested to advance a levy payment and then
incur risks and costs to get a refund, especially inasmuch as disadvantages caused could
exceed the advantages of the refund and could act as a disincentive to even file a claim for
reimbursement. Most current reimbursement systems for professional users are not compliant


                                                                                              16
with the CJEU judgment in the case Padawan v. SGAE C-467/08 and the principle of
proportionality.

National levies systems must exempt ex ante non-private users that cannot benefit from the
private copying exception. This may be easily achieved by shifting the obligation of payment
of levies to retailers at the point of sale, which are the only entity in the chain that can assess
the nature of the final purchaser since they interact directly with end users. This shift of
liability would also allow for levies to be paid in the country of destination, another
recommendation made by Mr. Vitorino. In fact, the only logical way to ensure that products
can only be levied in the country where the final user resides is to shift the payment of levies
to the end-user at the point of sale.

Even though today’s system is already enormously costly and burdensome, the shift of
liability would actually not impact such a supposedly large number of retailers since they
operate in significantly concentrated markets. According to a European Commission study
(“The Competitiveness of EU electrical and electronics goods markets with a focus on pricing
and pricing strategies” DG Enterprise – 2009), national markets for retailers are concentrated
in 17 of the 22 countries analysed. Indeed, 4 retailers or less dominate 50% of the market or
more in Germany, the UK, Poland, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia, Spain, Portugal, Italy,
Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Bulgaria.

Moreover, it must be recognised that collecting societies that receive monies from the levy
systems deal today with thousands of clubs, discotheques, etc. to collect similar monies for
other remunerations (e.g. for public communication) with an infrastructure already in place to
perform this collection. As a consequence, replacing numerous importers and manufacturers
with a limited number of entities such as retailers will not create any undue burden, and will
simplify the system for the greater benefit of society.

Levies paid at the point of sale, in combination with the obligation to display the
corresponding amounts, would make it extraordinarily easy for collecting societies to control
whether levies are paid, simply by visiting the concerned establishments and checking the
pricing and levy information on the shelves.

Finally, we believe that the idea of a European “one-stop-shop” for reimbursements would not
work in practice due to the non-harmonised tariff systems for copyright levies in the EU.


69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

Ex-post reimbursement systems for professional use do not function. The example of France,
where such a system is officially in place, is particularly telling. When replying to a written
question of a member of the French Parliament on 30 July 2013, French Minister for Culture
Ms Aurélie Filippetti acknowledged that by 14 May 2013, Copie France had only received
294 requests for reimbursement for business use. Of these, 176 were accepted and 118 were
rejected. The 118 requests have been rejected for the following reasons:

• Media has been acquired before the entry into force of the law;
                                                                                                17
• The private copying amount does not appear on the invoice;
• The entity requesting the reimbursement is not the final user;
• The request is made for media not subject to private copying.
 (The full text of the question and answer can be found on the following link:
http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q14/14-23672QE.htm).

Until 4 June 2013, the total amount reimbursed to professional users was €167,971, namely
€67,000 for 2012 and €100,971 in 2013. It has to be noted that according to market research
data each year a total reimbursement of €40 million should take place; instead only €67,000
was reimbursed in 2012. This huge discrepancy illustrates the inefficiency of the French
reimbursement system.
In Austria there is a similar situation. That Member State has a mixed ex-ante and ex post
reimbursement system which does not function well. First of all most market players are not
aware of the system and therefore do not use it. Secondly it does not work well in practice.
The system foresees that each commercial customer has to sign a written declaration that he
uses the device only for commercial purposes and has to send it to the purchaser and the
collecting society. This impracticable system was discussed in the recent CJEU judgment on
the Amazon v. Austro-Mechana case C-521/11; as a result of the judgment, the Austrian first
instance court now has to check the conformity of the Austrian system with European law. In
the meantime Austrian collecting societies have deleted the forms to be used by commercial
users from the website. Such a system is not workable for any players in a cross-border
market.


Also in Lithuania, a recent study on the copyright levies system shows that reimbursement for
professional users is not functioning. Professional users are generally not aware of the
existence of a reimbursement system, and those who are consider the reimbursement process
too costly and burdensome. Consequently, reimbursement to professional users only
represented 0,84% of all copyright levies amounts collected in 2012 (Final report of The
Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania, “The implementation of The European
Parliament and Council Directive 2001/29/EC in Lithuania: the provisions of fair
remuneration for the private copying of audiovisual works and phonograms. An economic
and legal analysis - 2014“).



70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

Ex ante exemptions schemes are indeed a much better system, as explained in our answer to
question 68. Also, the CJEU provided in the Amazon case that an indiscriminate application
of levies on the first placing on the market in a national territory may be compliant with
Directive 2001/29 only in case (i) it may be substantiated that sufficient practical difficulties
justify in all cases the absence of an a priori exemption and (ii) there is a right of
reimbursement that is effective and does not make repayment of levies paid excessively
difficult in those situations where use of the products is outside the scope of the private
copying exception (see Amazon case C-521/11, paragraphs 33-37 and 41-45).

                                                                                              18
In that context, “account must be taken of the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the
publicisation and the simplicity of use of the a priori exception” in order to determine if
sufficient practical difficulties warrant in all cases the absence of an “ex ante” exemption.
Moreover, “the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the publicisation and the simplicity
of use of the right of reimbursement” must be also assessed in order to determine whether
such a right of reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment difficult (see
paragraphs 35 and 36).

In other terms, the Court of Justice provided clear guidance on how “ex-ante” exemptions
should be preferred over “ex-post” reimbursements.

We encourage the European Commission as a matter of priority to further investigate these
practical difficulties and gather information on the following issues:
• Do professional users actually make use of the ex post reimbursement scheme? This must
be assessed by examining what amount has been reimbursed to professional users in the
Member States and what amount should have been reimbursed.
• Who can ask for reimbursement? Can the exporter seek reimbursement directly from the
collecting society, or should the exporter seek reimbursement from the vendor who afterwards
will need to claim back the levies paid from the collecting society?
• Which countries choose the option (only or in parallel to reimbursement) that a commercial
user does not have to pay a levy ex-ante? If so, how does it work in practice (e.g. through
certification or declaration of the commercial user)? Which are the proofs the commercial
user has to collect in order to benefit from an ex-ante exemption for business use?
• Do existing mechanisms for reimbursement in case of exported products work or is the levy
paid twice (in the country of origin and in the country of destination)? How long do exporters
have to wait for the reimbursement?

Also, there are a number of resources that are readily available that provide significant market
data. We suggest the Commission consults with IDC which has a proven track record of
providing independent and objective data and analysis of the ICT and consumer technology
market.

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
There is a long list of specific problems with the functioning of the levy system, which have a
significant and negative impact on artists, consumers and industry. The significant and
growing number of court cases across the EU and at CJEU level is highly illustrative of the
many problems caused by levy systems.
One key problem to be solved is the lack of clarity around the concept of harm, its definition
and calculation. According to Directive 2001/29 “harm” is at the core of the compensation
system. Referring to the “potential harm” is a way to justify tariffs that are disproportionate
and penalise consumers that do not engage in any copying with the devices they own. When
there is no harm or only minimal harm, no levy should be payable as foreseen in the
Copyright Directive. In fact, the judgment of the CJEU in the Amazon case C-521/11
acknowledges that natural persons should not be subject to levies and/or be refunded any levy
they may have been requested to pay in advance “where the final use of those media clearly

                                                                                             19
does not fall within the case referred to in Article 5.2(b) of the Directive” (see paragraphs 44
and 45 in fine), making evident that only actual harm may justify payment of compensation
for private copying.


The most prominent issues to solve are the following:
• There is no common definition of harm in the Member States, and the calculation of harm is
not based on actual private copying.
• As a consequence, scope and tariffs vary significantly across the EU.
- In most Member States the method for setting up tariffs is not transparent, and rarely allows
for a fair inclusion of the views of manufacturers and consumers.
• Products are levied when they are put on the market or when they cross a border, creating
undue double payments which are incompatible with Single Market principles.
• Reimbursement for professional use is almost impossible across the EU.
• Consumers are completely unaware that a levy for private copying is included in the price of
the products they buy.
• The distribution of funds collected via the levy systems is not transparent, and the systems
of cultural deductions are even more opaque.
•  Reporting obligations on manufacturers and importers impose huge additional
administrative and cost burdens on companies in respect of their commercial activities in
Europe.


Below is (a) a list of short- to medium-term improvements to the current device-based levy
system which should be suggested via an EU soft law instrument and implemented in the
Member States without delay as (b) new longer-term alternatives are developed and explored:


a) Proposal for short-term improvements


1. Licensed copies should not trigger the application of private copying levies.
• When defining harm caused to rightholders by acts of private copying at the national level,
Member States should clarify that authorised copies of licensed content do not fall under the
scope of the exception of private copying.
• When calculating private copying levy tariffs, Member States should clarify that authorised
copies of licensed content are not considered as acts of private copying which should give
right to compensation.
• This clarification should be enshrined in national legislation.

2. Define 'harm' uniformly across the EU as the value consumers attach to the additional
copies in question (lost profit).

                                                                                             20
• Define a strict and uniform interpretation of what falls under the private copy exception.
• Calculate ‘harm’ on the basis of the value consumers attach to the subsequent copies they
make, which refers to the economic utility of each copy.
• Produce an economic impact analysis on the definition and measurement of ‘harm’.
• Require all stakeholders to be represented fairly in the tariff setting process.

3. All information and data about levy systems in Europe should be accessible.
• Member States should regularly submit to the Commission the information on all of their
copyright levies (calculation methods, tariffs and scope, collection and distribution system,
etc.).
• The Commission should publish exhaustive up-to-date data to help reduce legal uncertainty
and support better understanding of existing practices and real impact on the market and
consumers.


4. Private copying levies should be made visible for the final customer.
• The levy should be made visible to the final customer at the point of sale (retailer level).
• The retailer should provide the information to the consumer on the invoice.

5. The liability for paying levies should be shifted from the manufacturer's or importer's level
to the retailer's level and the levy tariff systems must be simplified.
• Simplify the levy tariff system at Member State level by:
       - Reforming the structure and decision making process for the calculation of harm.
       - Defining a limited number of tariff classes.
• Introduce a clarification in national laws that levies should be paid by retailers who face the
final customers and can discriminate its public or private nature.
• Consider best practices in other sectors where such shift of liability has been implemented.
For example, the implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
(WEEE Directive - 2002/96 in France), where a levy is paid at retail level by the consumer.
Retailers also have to make this fee visible to consumers through a separate line on the
invoice.
Regarding this shift of liability, the Commission should investigate:
• How concentrated is the retailers market in the EU Member States where levies are
currently in place?
• How concentrated is the manufacturer/importer level in general and, in particular, what is
the number of retailers acting as importers in the Member States that, as such, already pay
levies?


                                                                                                 21
• Are levies efficiently handled in connection with cross-border sales by e-retailers, so that
retailers are effectively paying levies in the country of destination?
• How do refund systems upon exportation of levied products from one country to another
work in practice? Are they widely and effectively used?
• Do   collecting societies already have a collection infrastructure in place to handle micro-
collections from SMBs for other remunerations (e.g. collection from bars and nightclubs for
public communication) or exclusive rights (e.g. collection from copying centres)? Such an
infrastructure could be leveraged in order to collect levies at retailer level.


6. The distribution of funds collected via the levy systems should be closely monitored and
controlled.
• Artists, consumers and manufacturers should be informed of the way these funds are
distributed to ensure full transparency in the system.
• The distribution of funds should be based on strict, fair and transparent rules, and controlled
by competent national authorities.
• Regarding cultural deductions, it must be said that legally speaking private copying levies
have nothing to do with the general funding of culture. According to EU and national
legislation, private copying levies compensate the harm caused to rightholders, and they are
not intended as cultural subsidies. Cultural subsidies are a separate issue with no legal relation
to private copying under European law. In the Member States where funds collected through
private copying levies are used to finance cultural activities, there should be transparent
mechanisms of allocation and control of these funds by public authorities and not by
collecting societies.


b) Alternative systems


The private copying levy system should be eventually phased out and replaced by alternative
systems of compensation based on actual harm if there is still a need for compensation in
addition to licencing. The European Commission should organise an open and public debate
on these alternative systems without delay to explore the various options which have been
presented in the past or the alternative systems in place in some European countries. One
solution would be for Member States to be given complete discretion as to which alternative
to implement.


Limited private copying exception
The UK government published a draft legislative proposal in 2013 to introduce a narrow
private copying exception which is to be sufficiently limited so that it causes no significant
harm to rightholders. Consequently, no further compensation will be due to rightholders and
no private copying levy system will be put in place.
The rationale behind the UK government’s proposal is that a) some copying is already priced
into the purchase of legally acquired licensed content and b) that private copying causes no


                                                                                               22
more than minimal harm to rightholders. As a consequence no further compensation is due to
rightholders. The UK proposal is expected to be adopted by April 2014.


Payment of fair compensation through a State fund
This alternative system, which is already in place in Spain and Norway, is more transparent,
more controlled and a lot fairer to consumers and manufacturers than the levy systems in
place in other Member States. It must also be pointed out that the new Spanish system has had
a significant impact for consumers in terms of the price evolution for devices. Indeed there
has been a remarkable decline in the price for audio-visual, photographic and information
processing equipment, between December 2011 and February 2013, according to official data
published by INE and EUROSTAT (HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices), “Audio-
visual, photographic and information processing equipment”) and publicly available. In the
period December 2011 - February 2013, prices for the above mentioned equipment decreased
by 12,01% in Spain.


Payment of fair compensation through a household tax
In Austria, as part of a general examination of its copyright framework, some stakeholders
have put forward a proposal that would replace the copyright levies on hardware equipment
by a household tax (broadcasting license). The proposal is based on calculations that such a
fee would cost each household in Austria €0,50 per month or €6 per year and would result
in over €20 million revenue for rightholders. The benefits of this system is that it is simpler to
manage (no complicated tariff negotiations, no collection system), and would reduce the
collecting societies’ high administrative costs of administering copyright levies. The
reduction of administrative costs would also mean that more revenue would go to
rightholders.


- Several other proposals regarding alternative models of compensation have been presented
in recent years, such as the Enter Report “Compensation for private copying: An economic
analysis of alternative models” of July 2010.




V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers



The ICT industry has become an essential partner for the cultural industry: not only does
it manufacture devices necessary for cultural creation and the dissemination of cultural
goods, but it also significantly reduces market entry barriers for creators and has facilitated
the creation, consumption and distribution of an immense diversity of content. We constantly
invest and innovate to help content creators find ways and appropriate economic models to
remunerate their works and bring consumers back to direct payments or subscription models,
which helps us all present sustainable alternative models to free file-sharing. This partnership
is flourishing and bringing significant new opportunities for creators and consumers alike.

                                                                                               23
Online offerings are allowing Europe to produce more and more varied content than ever
before, thus promoting cultural diversity. This symbiosis needs to be encouraged not stifled
through outdated notions of the cultural industry.

DIGITALEUROPE firmly believes that artists should receive fair remuneration for their
work.

However it is essential to differentiate the ownership of rights and the remuneration of
rightholders: as noted by Pr. Ruth Towse, the copyright levy “has been almost universally
opposed by economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance
to the market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators”.
Pr. Towse also notes that “...policy makers should stop making statements such as copyright
‘ensures a fair return for creators and performers’. All it can do is lay the foundation for the
ownership of rights, not the reward they gain. Copyright’s rewards always come through the
market, even where institutional arrangements have been put in place by the state to ensure
that copyright is administered fairly”.[1]

Also, too often the concepts of remuneration and fair compensation are conflated. According
to Directive 2001/29 article 5.2.b, rightholders may receive fair compensation for the private
copying of their works if it causes more than minimal harm. Collecting societies still refer to
‘equitable remuneration’ and have not embraced the concept of fair compensation. Fair
compensation and equitable remuneration have very different meanings. The former reflects
the notion of actual harm while the latter is an expression of exclusive rights related to mere
usage. The copyright levy system can be understood neither as a revenue mechanism, nor as
equivalent or preferable to other forms of exploitation of exclusive rights.

This confusion is often made in the case of performers. Indeed, some collecting societies
claim that copyright levies are the only “remuneration” left for performing artists after they
licensed their rights to the producers, because producers do not want to pay artists for
"secondary uses". However the question of the remuneration of performers has no link
whatsoever to private copying levies. This is a contractual issue between performers and
other rightholders such as music publishers and recording labels, which should be settled
outside of the debate on private copying levies. It is not for the manufacturers or consumers
to “fill the gap” and pay one category of rightholders deemed to be aggrieved by another
group of rightholders.

VII.          A single EU Copyright Title




                                                                                                                                  24
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


The establishment of a single EU Copyright Title is not a priority at this stage. Many other
unsolved issues have to be tackled first.


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

The current level of difference among Member States’ legislation must be addressed in the
short term, especially regarding the regime of exceptions and limitations and notably the
problems surrounding the scope and application of the private copy exception. Fixing the
current problems is a higher priority, as the establishment of an EU Copyright title would
require long and thorough discussions.
