                               Response to the the European Commission consultation
                                     on the review of the EU Copyright Rules



Name: The Ppress

The Ppress is the publishers association of Belgian periodical press and has five departments:
B2B Press (journals), Custo (Customer Media), OPPAb (Professional Online Publishers
Association of Belgium), Febelmag (popular magazines) and Free Press (unpaid press).

The departments, each with their specificities and their definite target, each represent a
specific business model between and often also within publishing houses. The interaction
between the five departments generates significant added value.

As a professional association The Ppress defends the moral and material interests of the major
publishing houses of periodicals on our local market. She works to improve the knowledge of
the magazine industry and provides promotion to the world of the professionals and the
general public. Helping members to meet the expectations of users and advertisers is also a
key interest in the constantly evolving media landscape. Relevant local content is key on a
rather small regional market in the global digital media setting.

The Ppress ensures the permanent spread of general information to its members and
represents the publishers of magazines at the regional, national and international
organisations and institutions in order to strengthen a vibrant independent and sustainable
press.

Our members publish well over 90 % of periodical press in Belgium, with an annual turnover
of € 600 million. Representing 500 magazine titles selling 175 million magazines. Every
week 9 out of 10 Belgian citizens read a magazine for 1h.

Introductory comments:

The professional content produced by Europe’s magazine media, as well as providing
information on all topics that are relevant for society, constitutes an important element in the
shaping of public opinion that is essential in a democracy.

This high-value quality content costs a significant amount of money to produce, so effective
copyright protection is key to securing the independent journalism, comment and analysis that
are fundamental elements of any democracy. Publishers must be able to rely on copyright
protection to secure remuneration for their investment and for the sustainable delivery of
creative content.


                                                                                                   1

Magazine publishers want to be able to continue providing consumers with innovative,
professional content, but need to be able to continue to monetize content, otherwise current
business models will not be sustainable. They need revenue to be able to produce quality
content.

It is key that publishers continue to be able to decide to whom they make their content
available and under what conditions. It should not be the other way around, that people can
“free ride” and even make money off the back of publishers’ content (e.g., like search engines
and aggregators).

Magazine publishers believe that current copyright rules are broadly fit for purpose and any
further exceptions to copyright rules should be rejected, as they pose a direct threat to
publishers’ economic sustainability and their ability to develop digital business models.

As the Licenses for Europe initiative demonstrated, there are already many licensing options
available and more being developed and the EU is now actively supporting and funding
market-led work making it even easier for people to find out who owns rights, what they are
allowed to do with the content (and at what price).

It is important that the EU does not allow a weakening of copyright law, as doing so would
pose a risk to Europe’s media being able to continue producing the trusted, quality content
their readers enjoy and would therefore threaten media diversity.


      I.          Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


A.    The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions
and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements


3.       How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
Magazine publishers manage their rights (digital and analogue) on an individual basis
whenever feasible or possible. Sometimes it is decided that an RRO could better manage these
rights collectively.
As we understand, there is from time to time a demand for multi-territorial licences as regards
magazine content, reflecting the fact that content is mostly made for a specific territory,
taking into account language, cultural references etc. However, where such requests for
licences are made, we are not aware of any specific problems in the issuing of such licences.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
We have not identified any particular problems.

                                                                                               2
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers




5.      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all
the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
X YES
It is important that rightholders have choices about how to best licence their rights, in order to
reach their primary and secondary markets effectively. It is important that rightholders
continue to have the possibility to decide on which markets their content is made available.
There are not always sound commercial reasons to have content available in all territories or
to do so immediately. Additional considerations include the costs of translation or additional
services to attract an audience in a particular Member State. Furthermore, there are also
specific regulations at national level (e.g., concerning defamation, taxation etc.) that must also
be taken into account.
It would be damaging to the creative economy if regulation were imposed as regards how
rightholders might choose to exploit these rights.


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
X NO
The current legislative framework does not hinder cross border licensing in the magazine
sector. In fact, to the contrary, the current framework enables publishers to make their content
available across borders as they choose to do so.
While there does not appear to be a large demand for cross-border licensing in the magazine
market, requests can be met via either licensing direct from the publisher, or – for secondary
uses - via RROs (Reproduction Rights Organisations). For example, a magazine publishing
industry led initiative, Press Database and Licensing Network (PDLN) is further facilitating
the supply and use of press information internationally, making licensing of press clippings
across borders easier than ever.
We welcome the further development of market led solutions, which offer choice and
diversity for consumers and businesses in the digital environment. It is key for market
development that there continues to be an opportunity to offer choice in how a work is used
(be this linked to a time period, to permit copying, to reuse on other media etc.).

B.           The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions


      1. The act of “making available”


8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

                                                                                                3
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



YES


It is key that acts of “communication to the public” continue to be able to be treated separately
from application of other restricted acts, depending on how a “communication” is received
and how the work received is reused beyond the communication itself. The re-use must
continue to be subject to national rules in the territory where the communication is received
and “re-used” as regards the relevant copyright-restricted acts. Any move towards a country
of origin approach should be avoided.


9.      Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an
effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or
not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive
relief1)?
X NO
ECJ Case Law provides clarity to the law in this and other areas. There is a risk that
legislative changes impacting the territorial scope of the “making available” right could result
in a ‘race to the bottom’, whereby people favouring the least amount of copyright protection
establish servers in countries with the weakest copyright laws. This would negatively impact
investment in cultural and creative content and pose a threat to the creative industries.


      2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


10.    Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
x NO


      3. Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES, in certain specific circumstances

Specifically, as in the Meltwater case, where a hyperlink is comprised of or includes text
protected as the whole or part of a copyright work, the provision of a hyperlink would involve
the reproduction of the whole or part of a copyright work. In this case, the UK Court of


1
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 4
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



Appeal held that users of Meltwater’s news aggregation service required a licence (from
NLA) in order to be able to receive and read news snippets.

The Copiepresse v Google case in Belgium, where the court considered use of newspaper
content on Google News as infringing copyright, is also of relevance in this regard.

For any commercial use of hyperlinks there should be a clear authorisation by the magazine
publisher. In some case this can be based on copyright law, e.g. when the title or part of it is
included in the hyperlink. In some cases other commercial principles (e.g. trademarks or fair
competition) should apply.


12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

X YES, in certain specific cicumstances

Owners of websites more often than not want citizens to visit their website to read the
material provided, and therefore allow for them to make screen/cache copies of the page when
web browsing via an implied or express licence. Accessing content on a website – which
involves making a temporary copy of a work or other subject matter – should be subject to
rightholder authorisation like accessing a copy of a work or other subject matter e.g., received
by email would be. Rightholders should be able to continue to decide to refuse or charge for a
licence e.g., for any commerical use of the content.
Furthermore, allowing users to access content via websites which don’t have a licence – and
with the potential for lost revenue that this would entail - would conflict with the “three step
test” established under international and European law, given the conflict with the normal
exploitation of a work and the unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.


      4. Download to own digital content


14.     What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content)
concerned.
As regards digital magazine content, which most publishers now offer to their readers as well
as – or as an alternative to – print, a legal framework enabling resale of previously purchased
digital content would pose a major threat to magazine publishing businesses, which already
face a multitude of challenges such as piracy and the detrimental practices of dominant global
players.
Such a resale right would certainly undermine the primary market, e.g., by negatively
impacting prices and reducing incentives to invest in magazine content, and result in loss of
revenues. The outcome would ultimately negatively impact media pluralism.


                                                                                                   5
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



It should remain up to a right holder to decide on how their content can be used by others.

C.           Registration of works and other subject matter


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
X NO, except perhaps in the case of a voluntary system
16.          What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
17.          What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
18.          What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
It is for good reason that existing international treaties prohibit formalities such as registration
as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
Therefore, while a voluntary registration system could potentially aid in e.g., identifying
rightholders, any requirement or expectation to be registered in order to be sure of protection
of rights would be detrimental to rightholders. It is of concern that a registration system could
be burdensome in terms of administration, and while it might start off as being voluntary it
could ultimately be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights.


D.           How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

We welcome the EU’s continued support, including funding, for the work of market led
initiatives which aim to develop further internet based solutions for the provision of legal
access to and use of content. A recent example is the Rights Data Integration (RDI) project
which allows for automated access to content rights and rights data across the internet. We do
not think it would be appropriate for there to be any legislative intervention however.

E.           Term of protection


20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X YES
The current terms of copyright protection are still appropriate. As explained in Directive
2006/116/EC on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights, this term is
sufficient to cover two generations and provides a high level of protection of copyright and

                                                                                                  6
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



related rights which are fundamental to intellectual creation. It also importantly underlines
that this is intended to “ensure the maintenance and development of creativity in the interest
of authors, cultural industries, consumers and society as a whole”.


    II.           Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


X NO
As reflected in the Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC), there is a need for the legal framework
to be “general and flexible” in order to “foster the development of the information
society in Europe”. Flexibility – in the form of optional limitations and exceptions - is
important in order that the copyright framework can meet the needs of individual member
states, taking into account Europe’s cultural diversity as well as the different legal traditions.
The Copyright Directive recognises the importance of copyright and related rights as they
“protect and stimulate the development and marketing of new products and services and
the creation and exploitation of their creative content.”
Europe’s creative industries have indeed been able to thrive within the framework of the
current Directive, which also incentivises further investment. The significance of IPR for
Europe’s economy was recently underlined in a study by the EC, OHIM and EPO, which
revealed that IPR intensive industries contribute 39% of the EU’s GDP and 26% of the EU’s
employment, with 90% of its exports coming from IP intensive industries.



22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X NO
The Copyright Directive underlines that “any harmonisation of copyright and related rights
must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual
creation”. Furthermore, it states that “their protection helps to “ensure the maintenance and
development of creativity in the interests of authors, performers, consumers, culture,
industry and the public at large.”


There is no evidence that making exceptions mandatory and having a higher level of
harmonisation would benefit intellectual creation in Europe, to the benefit of the various
interests concerned. Furthermore, the cultural differences across Europe themselves
impose different exceptions.
As set out in the answer to Q 21, we believe that the current system with optional
exceptions remains the right one as it provides the necessary flexibility for creative
industries such as Europe’s hugely diverse magazine media sector to thrive, and to continue to

                                                                                                 7
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



deliver to consumers across Europe innovative, interesting new offerings on a variety of
platforms.



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO
We believe that the focus should be on proper implementation of the current exceptions,
rather than looking to add new exceptions and limitations. Many exceptions are subject to
legal discussions and unclear implementation and interpretation. In any case limitation should
be interpreted restrictive.
Additional limitations and exceptions would run the risk of further threatening publishers’
economic sustainability and their ability to continue producing the trusted, quality
content their readers currently enjoy. They would also impact their ability to develop new
business models and ultimately threaten media diversity. We do not believe that there is
sufficient evidence to warrant any such additional limitations and exceptions.
The Licences for Europe initiative has demonstrated that joint stakeholder action to further
facilitate access to copyright protected works across Europe is an important way of achieving
outcomes that can benefit both the creative industries and the European citizens that benefit
from their innovation.
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
X NO
The current framework of limitations and exceptions allows for adequate flexibility. We
would oppose the introduction of a US style “fair use” provision (which relies on litigation
and has developed via case law spanning several decades), which would result in a high level
of legal uncertainty if applied in the EU’s 28 Member States.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
X NO
We are not aware of any particular problems for magazine publishers as a result of the
territoriality of limitations and exceptions. As set out in previous questions, the flexibility
provided by the Directive, which allows for the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, is
important in order that the copyright framework can meet the needs of individual member
states, taking into account Europe’s cultural diversity.

A.           Access to content in libraries and archives


1.           Preservation and archiving


28.

                                                                                              8
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



(b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,
museum or archives of the preservation exception?
X NO
There is concern that once works are digitised by libraries etc. there could be pressure to make
these works available to the public, thereby endangering publishers’ commercial offers.




      2. Off-premises access to library collections


32.
(c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to
provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in
their collections, for purposes of research and private study?

It is important that rightholders should continue to be able to authorise of off-premises
online consultation of works and make appropriate agreements with libraries/universities
(rather than this being set out in law).


33.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
There is a concern that where libraries have digital copies they will want to provide off-
premises access which would be detrimental to publishers. It is important that this sort of
remote access is agreed in a licensing agreements – and not in legislation - and does not
prejudice right holders’ exploitation of their own publications, including magazine publishers.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
We do not believe that a legislative solution is needed.




      3. E – lending


36.
(c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other
materials electronically, including across borders?
X NO


                                                                                              9
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



We are not aware of intentions by libraries to make magazine content available electronically.
The right holders should be involved in these initiatives right from the start to ensure a good
collaboration and safeguard mutual interest.



37.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We are not aware of any specific problems at present as regards magazines. However, the
extension of the current framework to cover digital e-lending poses the risk that such an
activity could prejudice rightholders’ exploitation of their own publications, including
magazine publishers. It is particularly important that terms of any e-lending activities are
agreed contractually in advance between libraries etc. and rightholders.


39.    What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-
premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?


Selling access to copyright protected works is part of publishers’ business models and
therefore e-lending by libraries without licence is more likely to conflict with the “three step
test” set out in international and European law, in particular insofar as it conflicts with normal
exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholder.
It is therefore very important as set out above that any such e-lending is agreed contractually
by licence agreements with the rightholder in advance.

      4. Mass digitisation


40.     Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results
of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)
have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?


X NO
Mass digitisation of magazine content by libraries and other entities can potentially have a
negative impact on the development of publishers’ digital business models and the possibility
for them to monitise content.


The 2011 MoU did not include press publishers, in light of the fact that press archives are not
considered to be “out of commerce”, but an increasingly important source of revenue for
publishers.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

                                                                                               10
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers




X NO


B.           Teaching
42.
(b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other
subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
X NO
We are not aware of any specific cases of problematic use of magazines for “illustration” for
teaching.

43.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Licensing agreements are the most pragmatic way forward in addressing problems, rather than
e.g., legislation. They also help reinforce societal understanding that works have a value and
that using others’ works should therefore need a licence / authorisation.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Magazine publishers offer individual licensing schemes that are used extensively by e.g.,
the scientific and research communities (also together with collective licensing schemes
offered by RROs), for print as well as online use.
One outcome of the Licences for Europe (Working Group 2) was the development of a
“toolkit” setting out examples of tools currently available by RROs and other CMOs to
legally use copyright protected text and image works, including for education.


46.          If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
We believe that licensing solutions, both individual licensing schemes by publishers together
with collective management schemes, provide the most suitable, flexible solution in order to
provide broad, tailor-made, legal access to content for teachers and researchers. Legislation
on the other hand takes years to agree and implement and cannot keep pace with fast-
changing technologies in the same way that licensing can.


C.           Research
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.


                                                                                            11
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



(b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other
subject-matter are used in the context of research projects/activities, including across
borders?
X NO
While there are generally no major problems, for some publishers lack of consistency in
provisions on fair compensation for non-commercial research across the EU has been an
issue.


48.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Licensing – rather a legislative approach - is the most appropriate way forward.


49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
Publishers offer licensing to allow use of copyright protected material for research purposes -
as do RROs for certain uses of copyright protected works – which is becoming increasingly
efficient with technological developments.


D.           Disabilities
50.
(c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of limitations or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special
formats, including across borders?
X NO


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
As well as the exceptions and limitations currently in place in all EU Member States
favouring blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled, coupled with the WIPO
(Marrakesh) Treaty, which can now be implemented by Member States, Publishers and RROs
are open to offer licenses to facilitate access to copyright protected works for these groups.

E.           Text and data mining
53.
(c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and data mining
in relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?


X NO
We do not understand there to be any obstacles to using text and data mining methods. During
the ‘Licences for Europe’ Working Group 4 (WG4) on text and data mining (TDM) for

                                                                                            12
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



scientific research purposes, there was no evidence of market failure. Several participants
presented a range of practical and innovative solutions facilitating effective TDM in this
regard, which represent the result of major investment by the publishing industry and the
licensing organisations with whom they work. Some of these initiatives are already
successfully being used by publishers and researchers, while others are being launched or
piloted with a view to being launched in the coming months.


54.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We are not aware of any problems, but we would say that licences are the way forward, as set
out above, rather than introducing a new exception for TDM. One concern for magazine
publishers is that such an example could be misused, for example by news aggregators and
media monitoring companies in order to avoid getting a licence for their activities.


56.          If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Publishers continue to be open to discussing and finding licensing solutions together
with the research community, to facilitate text and data mining with the potential to further
research. As set out in the response to Q53, publishers and researchers are already benefiting
from the solutions which have been developed to date. We welcome these innovative
solutions and the continued work in this field and believe that this non-legislative approach
represents the most constructive way forward for both the researchers and publishers
concerned.

It is clearly for the mutual benefit of both publishers of content and miners to find
licensing solutions which permit researchers to mine works and allow them to do so as
seamlessly and easily as possible, while securing the publishers’ investments in their
publications.

It is important that potential miners continue to engage with the publishers to achieve the
best outcome for their research, given that the different platforms used by publishers have
different capabilities and given that it is important to avoid any potential disruption or
degradation to these platforms, which is possible when unmanaged mining takes place
without publisher support.

It is also important to underline that it is critical for the long-term sustainability of the
research and publishing communities that the end results of any research must not become
a substitute for the published content, which would jeopardise the authoritative content that
publishers provide which helps research to advance. It should remain up to rightholders to
decide how their content may or may not be re-used by others.



57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
One problematic issue seems to be the fact that many of those researchers that apparently
want to carry out TDM are not in fact approaching publishers or the organisations such as
those mentioned in our response to Q53, in order to try and facilitate the TDM process.
                                                                                             13

F.           User-generated content
58.
(c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing
works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across
borders?


X NO
To our knowledge, no specific problems have been raised by users in the context of being
refused permission to use magazine publishers’ content for UGC. In fact, we understand that
magazine publishers contacted by users who wish to use their content typically provide
licences for use of the content often for free, as long as it is not for commercial exploitation.
Publishers also make it easy for readers to share content, for example via Facebook. In the
digital environment, magazine publishers also started using more straight forward digital
solutions to share their content legally and as widely as possible.
More generally speaking, Licences for Europe demonstrated that licensing schemes are
increasingly available, including micro-licences concluded between rightholders and users
generating the content.


59.    (a) Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are
proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
X NO, we are not aware of specific examples of problems as regards identification of works
for online use – proprietary systems are sufficient in this context.

60.   (a) Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the
work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
No


61.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As set out above, magazine publishers use licensing solutions (see further details set out in the
Licences for Europe 10 pledges). We do not perceive UGC as a problem as such. The need
for any legislative action in this field to e.g., introduce an exception, has not been proven.
It should be noted in light of discussions about what UGC means, that it is important to
distinguish new original work created by a “non-professional” and existing works which such
a person either “copies”, or reuses, or “adapts” for the purposes of publishing a new
composite work. It is important that the public is properly educated about these distinctions.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Not applicable

                                                                                              14

63.          If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
As set out in our response to Question 58, magazine publishers contacted by users who
wish to use their content typically provide licences for use of the content often for free, as
long as it is not for commercial exploitation.


While we don’t perceive there to be “problems” per se in the area of UGC for the magazine
publishing sector, our pledge “User Generated Content: magazine publishers engaging with
their readers” contains a Declaration on improving the user experience. This sets out that
magazine publishers are committed to – and continue to be committed to - engaging with readers
and improving the user experience, including via the uptake of User Generated Content (UGC) in
their online publications and services, giving a voice to users as well as enhancing their
professional content offering. This is very much in the interests of both publishers and users
alike.
In this regard, we declared the importance of the following (see further details in the pledge):

1. Improving the user experience and involvement
2. Improving information about both what users can do with magazine publishers’ content and
what magazine publishers can do with users’ content
3. Promoting education about intellectual property rights (IPR)
4. Promoting awareness of the technological possibilities to better identify and protect content
5. Sharing best practices across the sector

    III.          Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the digital environment?
X NO
It is not necessary to change the provisions of the Copyright Directive (5.2 a and 5.2 b), and it
is important that there continues to be a requirement that certain exceptions are only
permissible where fair compensation is provided to right holders. The directive is clear: where
there is a potential harm, there should be fair remuneration.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?3

The licensing agreement should be verified first, and the best way forward is to clarify this
agreement.
The notion ‘minimal harm’ is not clear, therefor not suited for answering this question.

 Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          15
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


Where the right holder is remunerated for certain uses on the basis of copyright levies, the
device and storage medium remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in
connection with online services (e.g. if works are downloaded from a cloud portal and stored
on a PC or storage medium).


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?4
YES, generally speaking transparency is welcomed. Consumers however care most about a
clearly displayed all in price when purchasing products.


Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement
of goods or services?
X NO

We understand that as regards text and image levies the refund of device and storage medium
remuneration in the event of export is dealt with – without any particular problems arising
in most cases - by the responsible RRO.

This can however be contrasted with the reportedly serious problem of vendors of devices
based in another EU Member State refusing to pay levies.


68.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
This question is not relevant as regards text and image reprography levies, as the copyright
Directive (Article 5.2(a)) covers both private and professional uses, thereby justifying sales to
both private individuals and to business end users.



    IV.           Fair remuneration of authors and performers
73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          16
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



X NO
We believe that questions relating to fair remuneration should continue to be dealt with at
national level via licences and contracts.



    V.            Respect for rights

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
X YES
Civil enforcement needs to become quicker and cheaper, and it should be easier to identify
infringers. More generally, we need to improve the ability to enforce intellectual property
rights and avoid third parties making unlawful gains from copyright

The different possibilities to utilise content on the internet and via tablets make it very easy
for third parties, like aggregators, search engines and pirate sites, to use publishing houses’
creative content for free, without authorization and remuneration of the publisher.

Infringers make money from advertisements carried on illegal websites and also charge for
the downloading of illegally obtained content. It is important that copyright draws the line
between reference to content and unauthorised re-use.

Aggregators of information and search engines should always ask the consent of publishers to
reproduce their articles. While these operators claim that publishers have the possibility to ask
that their articles are not re-published on their websites, we agree that this form of opt-out
seems to be contrary to the logic of copyright which supposes on the contrary an opt-in.


76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?

As mentioned above, enforcement needs to become quicker and cheaper, and it should be
easier to identify infringers. At the same time, publishers provide valuable forums for
expression, so a situation must be avoided whereby a threat of liability will discourage
intermediaries from allowing users to comment online, which encourages the free expression
and exchange of opinions that are vital for a vibrant democracy.

As set out in the current legal framework, if a posting is illegal, it should be taken down, but
an intermediary should not be forced to monitor or even censor posts of users in general. A
situation must be avoided where access providers have unfettered powers to control content.



                                                                                              17
Belgian	  periodical	  press	  publishers



77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
X YES
It is important to find the right balance between respect for copyright and other rights as set
out above. The current civil enforcement framework largely finds this balance - and we would
not therefore propose an opening of the Enforcement Directive in this regard - while it is
ultimately up to Member States to implement it as they see fit.

       VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
X NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
NO
We do not see this as being appropriate either as a next step or in the longer term, in
light of our previous comments relating to the flexibility that is needed, and the cultural
differences that should be respected in different Member States.

VII.              Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
Please find annexed analyses made by the associations of magazine and newspaper
publishers.
After identifying sharp decline in circulation and advertising revenue the past years, the harm
that piracy and parasite sites inflict on magazine publishers is estimated. The current revenues
from licencing are extremely low: only 1% of the annual turn over of the magazine
publishers.
The measures we propose are within the current European framework, which is fit for
purpose.
