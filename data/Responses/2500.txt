Dear European Union Commissioner Barnier,                                                January 25, 2014



       In response to your request for comments on Copyright, I submit the following advice as an

unofficial European Union Consultant. I am the founder and CEO of The Winkle Institute on

Worldwide Economic Stability. I have also drafted the Proposed Constitution to the United European

Union and the Human Rights protocol that was submitted to the EU Human Rights Committee and

adopted last year.

       As for the legal issues of Copyright, I believe that the time for current copyright law has passed.

As a result of the internet and its vast search capabilities, I believe that enforcing existing copyright

laws is an impossible task which wastes much time and expense tracking down and prosecuting minor

violators.

       While mass abusers of copyrights and those who profit off of the work of others should be

tracked, the government should not be involved. It instead should be a legal matter between parties

where those who profit commercially can be held liable for civil damages of $1,000 per copy of a

copyrighted matter that was profited from, in a court of law. The burden of proof should be only that

the violator of the website making the copyrighted material available for release, or other persons who

directly profit from the illegal sale or illegal distribution of copyrighted material caused financial harm

to the owner of the copyright. This would be an easier burden of proof to established as the loss of

income from the illegal sale of presently copyrighted material can be as little as (1 ) one cent per copy.

       Copyright courts could be established as needed and the legal issues could be handled online,

including filing, discovery, and the impaneling of an impartial hearing panel instead of a jury. The

awards (judgments) could be enforced anywhere in the world, by any court in the world.

       The entire issue of criminal enforcement of copyright violators is pointless unless other laws are

violated in the process such as money laundering, etc.
       By implementing these steps, you could essentially bankrupt pirate site operators overnight and

cut the amount of websites illegally distributing copyrighted material without the authorization of the

original copyright holder.



Sincerely,

Mark Winkle, Founder/CEO

The Winkle Institute for Worldwide Economic Stability
