To the Public Consultation

on the review of the EU copyright rules

My name isLISE BOELL_and I work forEDITIONS ALBIN MICHELas
aDirecteur Département Licence.EDITIONS ALBIN MICHELis a French
publishing house.Copyright therefore represents the cornerstone
of our activityand of our return on investment.Wedirectly
employ194people and ourannual turnover amounted to72,23M€in
2012.We area member of the French Publishers Association (SNE)
whose position on this initiative wefully support.

The publishing industry is contributing in a significant manner
to the European economy. It isthe most prominent cultural
industry in Europe and in the world. Our industry has
contributed billions of Euros to both national economies and
EU's overal GDP, with a turnover of €22.8 billion for 2010 (40
billion €in market terms). In 2012, the turnover of theFrench
publishing industryamounted to2.8 billion€,i.e. 4.5 billion €
in market terms, 16%of which weregenerated by exports.The
European publishing industryapproximately directly employs
130,000 people full time (including 10,000 in Francefor the
publishing industry and 70,000 for the whole book chain).The
activity, the jobs and the investmentsof the publishing sector
directly dependon copyright and on a balanced legal framework.

More generally, with1.2 million jobs spread all over France, and
a 74 billion €contribution to the French economy,cultural and
creative industriesplay an active rolein handling the growth
and employment challenges facing France and Europe1

Publishers are developing a legal and diversified offer of
high-quality digital content and therefore contribute tofreedom
of expression, which they could not be doing without the current
copyright regime. During this period of adaptation of business
models and of economic crisis, it would be very risky in
economic terms to put this sector in a situation of an even
greater uncertaintyby changing the rules in the middle of the
game.

This is whypublishers would like to callonthe European
Commissionto be extremely cautious towards a possible reopening
of Copyrightacquisand to take into account its consequences on
the European economy, in particularon the cultural industries,
such as the book sector and more generally on
culturaldiversity.

In particular,there is norealneed to reopen theCopyright
directive.Publishers actively participated in the
initiativeLicences for Europelaunched by the European
Commission and proposed practical solutions to the issues
raised by users.Anydecision concerning the reopening of the
2001 CopyrightDirective shouldtake into account theseresults,
which are satisfying as far as the bookindustryis
concerned,especiallyfor theworking group on cross-border access
and portability of digital content, in which the French
Publishers Association participated more particularly.

PartIIof the consultation: Rights and the functioning of the
Single Market:questions 1to5:

Indeed thebookmodel already allows across-borderdistributionof
books and, along the development of the digital market, of
e-books.

Publishers are callingonthe European Commission to take into
accountthe specificities of the book sector, whether in terms
ofthe existence of linguistic barriers, ofthe development of
the digital market, which is still nascent in most sectors,
despite relevant experimentations, or in terms of the -
obviously marginal - role of collective management.

Publishers welcome the new digital environmentandarecontinuously
investing in order to build new offers of ebooksand enhance
access to books.Where strong business models exist, i.e.for
theBtoB ebooks,themarket has rapidly rosen,whereasthe BtoC
market is still experimental.

At national level,Frenchpublishers are continuing their work
with the various user categories, so as to identify solutions
adapted to their own needs (digitization ofout-of-commerce
works, proposalon statutory collective management of the
educational exception, cooperation with visually impaired
people, dialogue with libraries on e-lending). They also
reachedan agreementwith authorsin order to adaptthe
author/publisher contracttothe digital environment.Such
voluntarynegotiations are the best way to progress in a
flexible and concrete mannerand it would be counter-productive
to disturb this work.

Part III of the consultation: Limitations and exceptions in the
Single Market:questions 21to27:

Regarding copyright exceptions,it is of utmost importance to
respect the Three Step Test of the Berne Convention, also
enshrined in other international conventions and treaties.The
use ofexceptions should therefore be limited to situations of
market failure to respond to certain needs of the societyor in
case digital files cannot be provided via the distribution
channels or a system of licenses via collective management
organization.Since exceptions destroy the market, they should
be excluded whenevera commercial offerexists.

Part III.A. Access to content in libraries and archives

Questions 32to35:

As far as uses by libraries are concerned, publishers in
particular in the academic field(ex. Cairn.info in the Social
and Humanities sector)have developed business models allowing
underlicensesfor studentsand researchersto access remotely for
research, including across borders in a technically closed
network. Thesecanallowmany uses (“copyingandpasting”,printing,
downloading,forwarding to a colleague, etc.)andcan be adapted
more easily by contract than via an exception.

Questions 28to31:

Besides,adistinction should be drawn betweenthe prerogatives and
therefore the exceptions benefitting tolegal deposit libraries,
which have an official mission of preservation of cultural
heritage,andtopublic libraries.

Question 35:

Any library exception allowing making available online would
only create unfair competition with business models, and be
contrary to the Three Step Test.Moreover, this would go against
the current trend of libraries, whose role is less to accumulate
content butratherto help and train users in their search for
information.

Questions 36to39:

Regarding e-lending, the e-book market is only nascent for most
sectors(less than3% of the book market)andsales tolibraries
onlyrepresenta minorityof the book marketin general(around4 à
6%).Therefore the imposition ofan e-lending right would
conflict too dramatically with business models currently being
developed by publishers(including rental of comics via Izneo
for instance)and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
interests of the right-holders.The example of Denmark, where a
very permissive lending system called eReolen was launched,
shows that whereas e-lending rose exponentially, the nascent
market of e-books came to a complete standstill at during the
lending period.

The French Ministry of Culture is currently hosting discussions
on e-lending with all stakeholders. The study it had outsourced
toIDATEin 2013demonstrated that France was not lagging behind in
terms of e-lending offers2

.Publishers shouldthereforebe encouraged to continue
experimenting e-lending models, which licensesallow in an
efficient way, such as:Cairn.info (www.cairn.info),Immatériel
(http://librairie.immateriel.fr/), IZNEO
(http://www.izneo.com/), Numilog:http://www.numilog.com/,Prêt
Numérique en Bibliothèque
(https://dilicom-prod.centprod.com/documents/307-PNB_Presentation_V0201.pdf).

Part III.B. Teaching and C. Research

Questions 42to 49:

Regarding educational uses, textbook and academic publishers are
quite proactive in offering their books in paper and digital
formats to educational establishmentsand universities.In
France, all textbook publishers have been proposing most of
their works in both digital and printed formats since 2008:
more than 2,000 digital textbooks are available through a huge
array of licences. They developed digital platforms and portals
(Canal Numérique des SavoirsandKiosque Numérique de l’Éducation,
accessible via a single portal,WizWiz), which allow teachers (or
parents) to consult, order, download and use these resources in
the classroom or in any digital learning environment (or
elsewhere).

However such offers of school and academic e-books often meet a
lack of budget and/or teachers’ training in using these
resources.In higher education,the level of total document
acquisition expenditures per student in 2008 was: 45€ in
France, 140€ in the UK; the level of electronic document
expenditures per studentwas: 13€ in France, 27€ in the UK.
Moreover, since 2007, the expenses related to acquisitions for
post-graduate/ research level have been increasingly cutting
back those for the acquisition of high quality paper or digital
books in French.As a principle, public budget problems should
not be solved by extendingcopyrightexceptions .

In France, the exception for illustration for teaching is
actually served through a licencenegotiated by the French
collective management organization, Centre Français de la Copie
(CFC), which covers the scanning and making available of
extracts of books (including textbooks and academic books, as
well foreign books3

Foreign works receive 15% of the compensation due to
right-holdersfor thedigital educationaluses of the works
inhigher education.

, in particular from the Scientific, Technical and Medical
Sector) by teachers on secure school and university intranets,
against remuneration for right-holders. Such content could de
facto be accessed by students located abroad but such
cross-border needs have never been reported so far.

The solution is to encouragesuchlicensesand to protect the
market by maintaining the following obligations:

The exception for the benefit of teaching is limited to small
parts,

any copies made remain in the hands of the teacher and pupils
and are not passed on,

rightsholders are named and receive fair remuneration,

school books and academic books are excluded from such an
exception, as educational uses represent their main or even
sole market.

Moreover,school budgets should continue to view educational
material as crucial to a sound education of our children.

Part III.E.Text and data mining

Question 53 to 57:

Regarding text and data mining(TDM),the international
association of Scientific, Technical and Medical
(STM)publishers hascommitted to provide licensesfor
non-commercial researchers wanting to mine the articles and
data contained in published journals and books for which they
have a subscription, in the framework of Licences for Europe.
The European Commission should all the more encourage licensing
in this area asan exception would not solve the other issues
raised by TDM: the protection of data privacy, the risks of
unfair competition and thefrequentneed for the publisher to set
up a specific technical environment, such as an API(Application
Programming Interface),where the researcher may download the
content before mining it, which is not cost-free.

Part III.F.User-generated content

Question 58 to 63:

Regarding user-generated content(UGC), there is no legal void
for the use of a protected work in the print sector(exception
for short quotation or parody/ pastiche/ caricature, or licence
with the right-holder or new tools offered by the platforms or
Creative commons regime). As a matter of fact,even
“non-commercial” UGC often harms creators’ rights, competes
with legitimate sales, and is offered on sites with advertising
and/or profit motives.The European Commission should support
licensing, which is the only solution that respects moral
rightsofauthors.Publishers are indeed developing click-through
seamless micro-licensing system for cases that go beyond the
quotation exceptions. It would be contradictory to develop a
new regimeaiming at supporting new creators,but depriving them
of their copyright, and in particular of their moral rights.

Conclusion and questions7, 21,72-73:

As a conclusion, the Commission should encourage individual
licensing and contractual freedom in the online environmentas
this fosters innovation and the development of tailor made
business modelsand solutionsthatultimately benefit
allstakeholders, includingEuropean readers.Today, the
development of cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market is not prevented by the existence of different
legal frameworks.It should be further encouraged by the
EuropeanCommissionby further fightingpiracy which represents an
unfair competition towards legal offers and by ensuring a
healthy competition between the distribution actors.
