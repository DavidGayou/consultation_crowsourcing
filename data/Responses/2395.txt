     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright

in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law 9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
The issue of territoriality in the text and image sector is different from what it is in other
sectors. It is because rights for primary uses are normally managed individually – the author
grants a licence directly to the publisher for the commercial exploitation of a work (in both
physical books and e-books). Publishers usually acquire and manage worldwide, exclusive
(digital and analogue) rights for books in a specific language. Thus, they are enabled to sale
books across the whole market (including internal market), without limitations.
The last few years POLSKA KSIAZKA has received no enquiries regarding multi-territorial
licensing.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
According to POLSKA KSIAZKA the issue of territoriality is not a problem to the proper
functioning of the internal market. Rather, the problem lies in multi-repertoire licensing, as
CMOs face problems in obtaining repertoires from other territories. It results first of all from
business models employed by services providers and competition law obstacles, making it
difficult to develop pan-European licensing agreements for more than a partial, typically
national-based, repertoire.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
The copyright holder is in a position to limit the scope of the mandate granted to the CMO,
including limitations on the basis of territoriality. POLSKA KSIAZKA would respect such
limitation of the mandate by a copyright holder.
Also, rights administration by CMOs of certain secondary uses of already published works is
often supported by national legislation, in most cases limited to national territories (in a form
of a legal licence, a remuneration right or the extension of licensing agreements concluded on
the basis of exclusive rights to include works of non-mandating authors and publishers).
POLSKA KSIAZKA is in favour of such a solution that can be a tool to strengthening
national cultures of the European countries.

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in

the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?

POLSKA KSIAZKA is of the opinion that current EU legislation in the text and image sector
does not prevent the development of multi-territorial solutions with regard to text and image
works. Users are in a position to ask for permission to use a work directly from the publisher
or author and obtain it on a contractual and up to worldwide basis. Equally, CMOs administer
rights for secondary uses across borders on the basis of different legislation and models of
CMO operation. Rights for foreign authors and publishers are generally administered through
the network of bilateral agreements between CMOs. Thus, POLSKA KSIAZKA does not
expect particular legislative measures in the copyright field to be required at the EU level to
increase cross-border availability of text and image works.

B.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

2.       Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital

22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                             13

transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
According to POLSKA KSIAZKA there is no justified reason to treat the provision of a
hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright differently from
other exploitation acts, and thus exempt it from the copyright holder’s authorization
requirement, especially where the link leads to illegally made available material or to
copyright material not previously made available to the public. This is especially relevant to

25
    Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

the provision of paid-for services to business users, which would otherwise substitute for
services which currently generate important income streams for content owners. There are
licensing mechanisms in place to enable legal user access, so there is no reason to exempt the
act of hyperlinking to a copyright work or other subject matter from the requirement of
rightholder authorisation.
However, POLSKA KSIAZKA agrees that not all linking should necessarily be made subject
to authorisation. There should not be subject to the prior consent of a copyright holder to mere
link to other websites.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
POLSKA KSIAZKA presents the opinion that there is no justified reason to distinguish
between essentially the same act – making a copy of a work for the purpose of viewing
(reading) its content, on the basis of how the work is accessed. This would mean that the
copyright holder authorization is needed where a work is accessed in a traditional way (or in
the digital environment but by e-mail), but there is no need to get the permission of a
copyright holder where a work is accessed online. Moreover, if viewing and streaming were
not subject to rightholder authorisation, this would work in favour of online piracy, where the
problem is already notorious.
Therefore, POLSKA KSIAZKA is of the opinion that the end user should not be prevented
from reading, viewing or listening to content that has been made legally available on the web
with the consent of the copyright holder. Any further use, however, should be subject to
authorisation or licensing of copyright holder.
On the other hand, reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an authorised act
should not be required additional consent from the copyright holder. However, this does not
mean that all “cache” memory copies are to be considered “temporary” or strictly “incidental”
ones. The facts need to be analysed in each case separately and that is best left to the courts.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
In answering to this question, POLSKA KSIAZKA would like to, first of all, point out that a
trial of applying existing solutions to the digital reality should never be made automatically. It
is because some of these solutions are likely to be effective in the digital environment but

27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              16

some others not. The concept of exhaustion of copyright is one of the best examples of such a
situation.
In POLSKA KSIAZKA’s view, the creation of a legal framework enabling the resale of
previously purchased digital content would have many negative business effects. If users were
to be allowed to sell e-books or articles of the same quality as the initial copy, it could
eventually lead to the destruction of (parts of) the primary market, as there would be no
reason for any reader to pay for a new e-book if the identical file was available second hand at
a lower price. This risks, in turn, impacting negatively on the EU’s foreign relations, given
that EU publishers would be less interested in making low-cost digital content available in
countries that cannot afford to pay the full EU price.
As was confirmed by the CJEU in the Oracle vs. UsedSoft decision, Case C-128/11, the
principle of EU exhaustion refers only to tangible copies of works. The ownership of digital
files and the possibility of their resale, as envisaged in the UsedSoft case, is limited only to the
specific case of software. Accordingly, the German Regional Court of Bielefeld stated in
March 2013 that the reasoning in UsedSoft could not be applied to other digital subject-matter
as the EU law does not permit the application of the principle of exhaustion to works in non-
analogue form29.



C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered31.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
A registration system at EU level, if made voluntary, could help in the identification of works
and copyright holders, and thus in the facilitation of copyright licensing.
It must be reminded here, however, that in the book publishing sector there are already
identifiers being used to identify the text, the publication and the author and publisher, in the
form of the ISO standard identifiers ISBN, ISSN, ISTC, ISNI, and DOI, which is basically
what is needed to help in the identification for licensing purposes. Therefore, POLSKA
KSIAZKA does not believe that any additional system of registration needs to be created and
applied to the text and image sector at the moment.
17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. Thus, authors and
publishers cannot be required or expected to monitor notifications in the EU and its Member
States.
18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 35 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that supporting technological and business innovation in
promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases, is a much more effective
policy than introducing new pieces of legislation in this field.
Therefore, we would encourage the European Commission to give its support to the projects
such as ARROW and ARROW Plus also in the future. EC support could also be given for
projects to populate vital databases being used by EU projects with agreed international
standards. Also, there is a need for CMOs to be able to use such standards to optimise their
distribution activities, as required under the EU CRM Directive. A feasibility study is
desirable to see how the international standards ISNI and ISTC can be interfaced with the
private databases of the CMOs, for instance, in the text and data field, so that distribution of
revenue can be better automated. Such a study could be financed, totally or partially, by the
European Commission.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain
POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that the current terms of copyright are still appropriate and sees
no need for a change of the term of copyright at this stage. In our opinion whether the

environment is digital or analogue is irrelevant to the question of term of protection.
Intellectual property is a fundamental right which like other property should be passed to the
owner’s heirs, at least for one generation and there is no reason, be economic or
philosophical, to deprive an author from this right in the digital environment. This is based on
a false assumption that the creativity input would be less in the digital context. Moreover, a
reduction of the term of protection could also be detrimental for the exploitation of a work as
often authors need to wait the publication of more than one work before knowing some
commercial success or often meet success only at a later stage, for example when a film is
made from their book. It should be therefore ensured that both the authors and publishers are
able to enjoy return of investment on the book if commercial success comes at a later stage.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC37.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework

for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")41.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
POLSKA KSIAZKA does not see any specific problem arising from the fact that most
limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
Member States. Conversely, in our view the current solution allows Member States to reflect
legal and cultural traditions of both civil and common law countries. This, in turn, ensures the
flexibility required by differences in national culture and traditions and thus reinforces the EU
strength.



41
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           21

Differences between national copyright laws are by no means an obstacle to the creation of an
online market in the text and image sector, which is intrinsically divided in linguistic areas.
Moreover, there is no single proof that more mandatory exceptions and limitations would
have led to a better result than the pragmatic approach based on optional exceptions and
limitations, combined with the development of practical solutions on a case-by-case basis to
enhance harmonisation, when required and appropriate. At the moment, POLSKA KSIAZKA
does not see how more detailed norms on a EU level could serve the purpose of improved
access to copyright works or enhanced competitiveness in a changing technological and
media environment.
Rather, POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that further EU limitations or exceptions could cause a
risk to publishers’ existing business models. This, in turn, could lead to a threat to the
publishers’ ability to continue fulfilling their democratic mission in society, and also place
media diversity at risk.

 NO – Please explain
As already mentioned in answer to Question 21, POLSKA KSIAZKA disagrees with the idea
that some or all copyright exceptions should be made mandatory. The fact that existing
exceptions / limitations are optional leaves room for the right amount of flexibility, which is
so important to ensure that the copyright framework matches the needs of the individual
Member State in a fast changing environment.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA does not see any specific need to add or remove exceptions from the
existing list. Rather, it would be of a greater use to focus on the proper implementation of the
existing exceptions and limitations, and stakeholder solutions developed on the basis of them,
such as the ARROW system to facilitate rights information management, the Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-
of-Commerce Works, and the EU Stakeholders Dialogue Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) on access to works by people with print disabilities.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why
In POLSKA KSIAZKA’s view the optionality of exceptions and limitations in the Infosoc
Directive provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. We do not believe that broader
wording of exceptions would serve the purpose of better harmonisation. Yet, more flexibility
could lead to legal uncertainty for both rightholders and users. On the other hand, we indicate
that any legislation, however technology neutral, runs the risk to be too closely tailored to
business models and technologies of its day rather than allowing for future developments. A
solution to this problem are licenses that are the quickest, most flexible and most effective
way of achieving technology neutral and targeted solutions.
Additionally, POLSKA KSIAZKA points out that there is no need to introduce a general rule
such as fair use into the EC legal system. In our view this could bring a huge legal uncertainty
for copyright holders as this test in the US is based on a century of jurisprudence that would
not be available to the legal framework in Europe. Moreover, the US fair use doctrine
provides a statutory defence mechanism to what could actually be infringement of exclusive
copyright, and is not combined with any remuneration payable to a copyright holder. That
proves to be utterly incompatible with the Infosoc Directive.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

According to POLSKA KSIAZKA the territoriality of limitations and exceptions does not
constitute particular problems. Demands for cross-border or multi-territory licensing are
limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on the basis of the current models of operation,
first of all being licensing. Licenses foresee uses across borders and can, unlike legislation,
rapidly adapt to changing environments.
     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
With respect to rights administered by CMOs, remuneration should be paid by the entity that
signs the agreement with/is authorised by the CMO. Remuneration in this case should be
collected by the CMO granting the authorisation or collecting the compensation. POLSKA
KSIAZKA notes, however, that in cases of cross-border uses, the question of fair
remuneration may raise difficulties in the current economic setting, with budget cuts
occurring in all EU Member States and, in particular, for the big linguistic areas. Licensing
solutions are acceptable in closed networks of schools, universities or libraries, but if
exceptions allowed uses involving communicating content on the Internet, and so having wide
cross-border effect, it would be difficult to compensate rightholders in a fair and balanced
manner.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions43. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 44.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
CMOs are in a position to negotiate agreements with libraries that enable them to provide
remote access, including across borders, to text and image works, normally for internal,
personal, not for direct commercial use of fragments of works, and for document delivery.
Organisations representing libraries, archives, authors, publishers and CMOs have a proven
track record in developing solutions for libraries and archives through stakeholder dialogues.
Examples are principles for rights clearance and registries of orphan works and out-of-
commerce works; model licensing agreements for the making available of out-of-commerce
works in closed and open networks; the Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on
the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works by libraries; and the
development and deployment of ARROW to facilitate and reduce costs in rights information
management.
POLSKA KSIAZKA presents the position that licenses are the best way to tackle the problem
of granting students and researchers access to the works or other subject-matter. We opt for
strengthening of licensing mechanisms in this regard.

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that libraries remain important institution for readers and have
an important mission in giving access to books to the wide public also in the digital world.
We acknowledge the libraries’ request to shift their activities from traditional on-premises
consultation or public lending towards online developments but we believe that this shift has
to be done with respect to the nascent e-book market. Moreover, if all or a majority of library
services were to be offered online, there would be no more reason to maintain local libraries
as a single central service would be sufficient.
Also, a distinction should be made between different genres of publishing and so between
academic and public libraries. In the academic sector existing business model is about
licensing 99% of the content to academic libraries, whereas in the trade book market libraries
represent at best 5% of its revenues. This means that in most countries 99% of the publishers’
revenues are sales through bookshops. As selling access to copyright works, rather than
physical copies, is an essential part of the business model in the digital environment, in
particular in trade-book publishing, library e-lending will more easily conflict with the normal
exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholder.
Also, it may no longer be seen to represent a special case, and thus easily conflict with all
three criteria of the three-step test in international conventions that EU Member States are
party to.
E-lending from libraries can, and should, nonetheless, take place, on the basis of contractual
arrangements with copyright holders or their representatives. Various models are being
explored, and the main challenge now is to identify and communicate practices that best serve
the expected purposes.

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 46.

digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has planned to introduce a regulation on out
of commerce works in the form of amendment of the copyright law (Act of 4 February 1994
on Copyright and Related Rights), although last statements from the Ministry are decisive
only about the orphan works, and not on out of commerce works anymore. However, we think
that any possible solution on the out of commerce works, also concerning cross-border effect
of the 2011MoU, should be made by enactment of a proper law / amendment to Copyright
Act in order to be effective.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
From POLSKA KSIAZKA’s point of view the concept of “illustration for teaching” itself
often causes uncertainties.
POLSKA KSIAZKA understands the exception in Article 5(3)(a) of the Infosoc Directive as
being a narrow exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it reads: to
illustrate; which is far from being the same as planned producing of teaching material. The
underlying rationale for the concept of “illustration for teaching” is to cover minor acts of
copying. Teaching material in whatever format, including multiple copying for classroom use,

     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                    30

cannot and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it would definitely undermine
the normal exploitation of these works. However, there are educational institutions, also in
Poland, that have claimed recently that “illustration for teaching” includes multiple copying
and other forms of uses which have traditionally been authorised through agreements with
RROs, or made subject to remuneration, including under remuneration rights schemes. On
this basis, these institutions refuse to take up a licence with the appropriate RRO.
  NO
  NO OPINION

43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As regards the aforementioned problem with the concept of “illustration for teaching”,
POLSKA KSIAZKA suggests that clarification on both EU and national levels that
“illustration for teaching” does not comprise the reproduction, making available and
distribution of teaching material would be appropriate.
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Scientific and research communities make extensive use of individual licensing schemes
offered by publishers, combined with collective schemes offered by RROs, also for online use
of works for teaching or research purposes.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

46.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA is of the opinion that any solution in this regard should encourage
licences and protect market-based offers by ensuring that: any limitation for the benefit of
teaching is limited to small parts; copies made under the limitation remain in the hands of the
teacher; rightholders are named and receive fair remuneration; certain categories of works can
be excluded from the limitation or exception; educational material is promoted as crucial to a
sound education, providing cultural vitality and economic prosperity; interoperability is an
important criterion when providing for e-reading possibilities and/or e-reading material in
education.
In our view entering into individual and collective licensing schemes offered to educational
establishments by rightholders and CMOs is what provides the broadest and most adequate

                                                                                              31

legal access to intellectual property to the teaching and research communities. In a fast
changing world licences offer comprehensive tailor-made solutions to access scientific and
literary works to meet the needs of educational institutions. Moreover, healthy educational
systems with broad access to local resources contributes significantly to the country’s
economy and employment. EU educational publishing industry itself should be viewed as a
strategic asset of the EU economy, and not as a burden, otherwise EU may end up in a
situation in which it will be constrained to use only non-EU educational contents.


C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
In Poland, certain uses of copyright material in relation to research is authorised through
exceptions, without remuneration to copyright holders. However, POLSKA KSIAZKA
48
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                    32

questions whether these exceptions, giving research institutions very broad opportunity to use
the copyright content without any compensation to copyright holders, are compliant with the
three-step test in international legal instruments that Poland is party to.
Other solutions are statutory limitations with remuneration to authors and publishers, which is
the case as in Austria, Germany and Belgium.
Yet, POLSKA KSIAZKA presents the view that the use of copyright content for research
purposes is best effected through the licences offered by publishers. In the case of scholarly
journal publishing, publishers are offering 90% of their products in digital form having
successfully covered the objective of providing access to the content. Certain uses of
copyright works in conjunction with research are also licensed by CMOs. For example
CEDRO, the Spanish RRO, offers an online platform – Conlicencia.com – to their various
licensing solutions that enables access to and secondary uses of more than 20 million books,
journals, magazines, newspapers and sheet music published in more than 30 countries that
CEDRO holds in its repertoire. The US RRO, Copyright Clearance Center (CCC), through its
RightsLink service, offers point-of-content licenses for digital uses and photocopying of text-
based materials by users in European libraries and academic institutions of all types.



D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
Exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights in favour of persons who are blind, visually
impaired, or otherwise print disabled, exist in all EU Member States. Also, CMOs administer
statutory provisions or offer licensing agreements to facilitate access to copyright published
works for those user groups. On the other hand, publishers are increasingly publishing books
in the e-Pub format, which can be directly converted into files accessible to persons who are
print disabled. Those files can be sold to users directly or to institutions serving the
community of the print disabled.
However, POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that in order to facilitate accessibility to content for
people with a disability, agreements between rightholders and trusted intermediaries to
facilitate the production of special formats are even more important than the mere application
of limitations and exceptions. Accordingly, POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that projects as the
EC-facilitated ETIN (European Trusted Intermediary Network) and the WIPO-facilitated
TIGAR (Trusted Intermediary Global Accessible Resources) are very valuable to overcome
any technical or practical obstacles in access to copyright works by persons with disabilities,
and should be financed broadly.
The main challenge is linked to the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. The
WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually
Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled, will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the

                                                                                              34

cross-border exchange of such copies. Also, some CMOs offer licensing agreements that
allow for the distribution of accessible format copies within the EU (Copyright Licensing
Agency Ltd. (CLA), Literar-Mechana and VG Wort).
In any case, in POLSKA KSIAZKA’s view commercial availability should remain prevalent
on the exceptions with regard to accessibility of copyright works for benefit of people with a
disability.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”53. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

   For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

POLSKA KSIAZKA is of the opinion that there are no specific problems resulting from the
use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content at the moment, and that
there is no need to introduce an exception for TDM. Authors and publishers are not blocking
access for TDM. Rather, they are offering licensing solutions that permit the text and data
mining of copyright-protected works and other subject-matter. Licensing solutions exist both
for commercial and non-commercial uses, offered by copyright holders directly, or via
collective rights management organisations.
  NO OPINION

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Although POLSKA KSIAZKA thinks that there are no serious obstacles to the use of text and
data mining in relation to copyright protected content and so we do not believe there is a need
to introduce an exception for TDM at the moment. However, this does not mean that we do
not see aspects of TDM that could be cleared / improved. The main thing would be to clear
the definitions of text mining and data mining itself. Then, what needs to be clarified is the
right of the copyright holder to control access to TDM databases, protection against unfair
competition linked to commercial exploitation of text and data mining, and the lack of
constructive dialogue with some key user groups, in particular those who walked out of the
European Commission Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue initiative.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA is of the opinion that what can be additionally at stake when talking
about TDM is the protection of data privacy, if one mines content that can be found openly on
the Internet, and competition issues related to remedies provided by search engine in
scrapping the Internet and re-using the content.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs54. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders

54
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

[Open question]

POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that licensing is the best solution in this case, which is also the
only solution that respects moral rights of copyright holders. We do not see any need to
introduce a new exception for the so-called user-generated content. In our view, if someone
wants to make use of pre-existing works, he should be subject to the same treatment as
everyone else using any other protected content, and so he should do it on the basis of
licensing agreements. We remind here that a toolkit for licensing has been already developed
within the framework of the Licences for Europe initiative, in its Working Group on UGC
and Licensing for small-scale users of protected material (WG2). This document brings
together, for the first time, a range of licensing solutions, such as solutions for the

identification of rightholders, their agents or other representatives (such as CMOs) from

 IV.        Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions59 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that there is no need to change Articles 5.2 (a) and 5.2 (b) of
the Infosoc Directive. In particular, it must continue to be a requirement that certain
exceptions are only permissible if fair compensation is provided to the rightholders.

Current levy systems, where in place, have their own merits and are one of the ways to
foresee the compensation for private copying and reprography. Every country deals with its
situation within a national and cultural context which cannot be exported to the rest of Europe
on an arbitrary basis. POLSKA KSIAZKA therefore does not believe that there is a need to
harmonise further the functioning of the levy systems, especially with regard to the amount of
levies paid to rightholders that must be calculated on a national basis.
There is, however, a need for clarification that, in respect of text and image levies,
“rightholders” eligible for “fair compensation” comprise both authors and publishers.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?60

 NO OPINION
The CJEU decided in the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to C-460/11) that a possible consent by the
copyright holder to the copying of his work or other protected material in the context of the
exceptions or limitations provided for in Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair remuneration
payable under the exception. This means that remuneration paid to the author or publisher
under a licence does not preclude receiving the fair compensation for the exception or
limitation. Such copies may therefore be covered by the levies.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
In case of copyright levies for certain uses of protected works, the device and storage medium
remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in connection with online services
(cloud computing). That is, for example, the case if works are downloaded from a cloud portal
and stored on a PC or storage medium.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments62.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
 YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that EU legislation is in a position to ensure that there is no
ambiguity with respect to the obligation to pay the levy according to the tariffs and methods
of the country of destination to the RRO in that country. Yet, as the Amazon v. Austro-
Mechana case shows, sometimes there are substantial problems with vendors of devices based
in another EU Member State refusing to pay the levy. In addition, it should also be clarified
that any dispute in this regard should be regulated in and in accordance with the rules of the
country where the levy shall be collected.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
The question is irrelevant with regard to text and image (reprography) levies (such a statement
was also made in the report from the EC-appointed mediator António Vitorino). It is because,
unlike the scope of the private copying exception under Article 5.2(b), which is limited to
reproductions that serve a specific purpose ("for private use") regardless of the type of device
and method, the reprography exception under Article 5.2(a) covers reproductions on a specific
medium (paper), using a specific method ("any kind of photographic technique"), regardless
of its purpose, which may be for professional, educational, private and other uses. It follows
that the reprography levies cover both private and professional uses.
Accordingly, with regard to reprography levies there is of no importance to make a distinction
between private and professional uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a
levy. Consequently, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between sales of devices in the
private and business sectors. Making a copy of a copyright work is permitted by law in both
the private and business spheres, therefore the device and storage medium remuneration can
be justified both for sales to private persons and sales to business end users.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
Question 70 becomes irrelevant in light of our answer to Question 69 above.
71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA sees as a main problem with regard to the functioning of the current
levy system a consistent trend to confuse private copying levies and text and image
(reprography) levies, and to discuss the reprography levy as if it was identical to private copy
levy. We believe that the EU could contribute to clarification in this regard through at least
sensitising EC officials and EU policy makers and institutions that text and image
(reprography) and private levies are different, and ensure consistency in their dealing with the
two different levy schemes.
Also, we would welcome the regulation of the obligation for exporters to pay the levy
according to the rules of the country of destination (Question 68).

  V.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration

                                                                                              43

rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers63 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract64. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 VI.        Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose67. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure68. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
POLSKA KSIAZKA believes that the current EU legal system framed by the 2006
Enforcement Directive is satisfactory, although enforcement rules differs in practice as some
Member States failed to implement some of the provisions correctly. Moreover, the rapid
evolution of the Internet has created new ways to infringe copyright that should also be taken
into account by the current EU legislator.
We are of the opinion that wider legal access to works can only be achieved through
appropriate mechanisms which include direct licensing by authors and publishers and
collective management of rights, combined with protection against infringement and
copyright enforcement, including efficient combating of piracy and other forms of
unauthorised reproduction. CMOs play an indispensable role in this regard.
We would like to also point out that what is very problematic is the distinction between
commercial and non-commercial use of protected works, as most of the “non-commercial”
exchange websites benefit from advertisement revenue and file download / exchange.
However, our position is rather to go after the source where the illegal websites are
originating than after individuals.

involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,

infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA would welcome a collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
to address copyright infringement and enforcement issues, as well as any Commission’s
initiative in this respect, especially with regard to awareness-raising campaigns.
Also, we believe that some clarification would be needed when it comes to the involvement of
intermediaries. We share the opinion that search engines which enable the indexation of file-
sharing websites host or facilitate the distribution of pirated content should contribute to
reducing online copyright infringement through preventive measures such as preventing
suggested automatic searches to suggest illegal search and through responding efficiently to
“notice and take down” (“notice and action”) notifications.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.


                                                                                             46

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
 NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA does not believe that a single EU Copyright Title will bring any benefits
to the development of the situation of EU copyright holders. Differences between national
copyright laws do not constitute an obstacle to the creation of an online market for the text
and image sector as long as proper licensing schemes are employed. Moreover, there is a risk
that EU Copyright Title could lower copyright protection standards, which in turns would
certainly discourage investment in content. Not discussing whether the Community is entitled
at all under Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty to introduce a single Community copyright title,
and not referring to the huge amount of time that would be needed to achieve a solution
acceptable to all Member States.
Therefore, we prefer that the EU rather continues to pursue a pragmatic approach focused on
the proper enforcement of existing rules and adoption of an overall intellectual property (IP)
strategy.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
POLSKA KSIAZKA would like to make a comment on the scope of this EC consultation
which, in our opinion, is still inadequate to the challenges of the digital technology nowadays.
Also, we would suggest the reflection on the need of the creation of a specialised panel of
judges, responsible for copyright legal matters, at the CJEU, as more and more cases on
copyright issues are decided by the court that require a stable institution with copyright
experts.
