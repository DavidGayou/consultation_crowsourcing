EU-Copyright Consultation

    -   4-7 (crossborder-availability): As long as the provider of an online service
        pays an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of the rights in copyrighted
        works to the producer and I participate on the income in an adequate way,
        there is no reason to limit the license to a certain territory. However, it is the
        decision of the service provider in the first place to limit his service to certain
        territories. This business choice is mainly due to economical aspects, local
        interests and the quality of broadband coverage in the respective country.



    -   10 (2 rights for 1 use): In the offline-world in broadcasting (broadcasting
        rights, mechanical rights for a broadcast) the practice of licensing two rights for
        one exploitation exists for a long time and has not caused any problems so far.
        With regard to the “online-rights” for online exploitations, I have not
        experienced any difficulties in the licensing practice either.



    -   11 (Hyperlink): Everybody who embeds my work from my website e.g. in his
        website in such a manner that the user of this other website is not led to my
        website, exploits my work for his own benefits. I have no benefit from that,
        since the user does not visit my website. But the benefit of the embedder is
        enormous, because his website becomes more attractive for visits. In case the
        embedder generates revenues from advertisement on his website or other
        revenues, the embedder even has a direct financial benefit. I believe that for
        this indirect or direct benefits from the usage of my creations, the embedder
        should be obliged to provide the rightholders with an adequate remuneration.



    -   14 (resale of digital files): Digital files can be reproduced much easier than
        tangible data carriers and without the loss of quality. Therefore, there is a high
        risk that the resale of digital files, such as mp4/AV-files of audiovisual works,
        would lead to massive misuse. Numerous unauthorized digital copies could be
        sold as alleged originals. How is the purchaser to know, if he bought the
        original or only a copy of the digital file? Since the quality of the digital copy is
        identical with the quality of the original, the resale of declared copies of digital
        files within a declared “2nd hand service”, in which copies naturally would be
        sold for a cheaper price, would result in an inexorable drop of the price for the
        originals. Not only would cause this immense financial harm for film-producers
        and -authors, but also for online service providers.



    -   20 (terms of copyright): Copyright in no way hinders that a work is exploited
        or used for the creation of another work. Copyright merely provides the

1
        rightholder with an adequate remuneration for the usage of his/her work. The
        shortening of the copyright term would harm not only the film-authors, but also
        the film industry. Who would benefit from the shortening of the copyright term?
        Truly only those, who exploit copyright protected content without being willing
        to pay for the exploitation of such content. It should not be forgotten in this
        context that the protection of intellectual property is a human right (Art 17/2 of
        the EU Charta)!



    -   58-63 (User generated content): I believe that I as rightholder shall be the
        one entitled to decide about who exploits my works and in what manner the
        exploitation of my works occurs. Mainly, I do not want my works being
        exploited together with content or in a context I cannot identify myself with.
        E.g. if my film gets synched with a song by a right-winged-extremist group, I as
        rightholder should have the right to prohibit such a usage. Besides that I
        believe it is unfair, if someone else makes money with my works and I have no
        financial benefit from that. Online Services that financially benefit from users,
        who produce and upload videos containing works that do not belong to them
        in large quantities and who do that for free, should be obliged to remunerate
        the producers and film authors of the exploited works!



    -   65 (remuneration for private copying): The licensing of online-services, e.g.
        of a download store (iTunes, Flimmit in Austria), where the download is
        licensed by rightholders and the payment of levies for the subsequent private
        copies of those downloads that are made by consumers are not mutually
        exclusive. The license enables the provider of online-services to allow the
        consumer to download digital files. Whereas the private copying levy is a
        compensation for the private copies the consumer makes of that download.
        Therefore, what is licensed by a service provider is different from what is
        subject to private copying levies. The licensing and the application of private
        copying levies can and shall co-exist.



    -   72 (fair remuneration): In those areas of exploitation, where I as rightholder
        have no overview of who exploits my works and how often my works are
        exploited due to the multiple users existing in Austria and abroad and due to
        the diversity of technical possibilities for exploitation, I believe that collective
        management is the best model to ensure fair remuneration. Also as a film-
        author I want to be remunerated for the online-usage of my works in an
        adequate way.
