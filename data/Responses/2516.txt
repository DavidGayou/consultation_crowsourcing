                    Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright framework

                                British Sky Broadcasting Group plc. Response

British Sky Broadcasting plc. (“Sky”)1 is the UK and Ireland’s leading pay TV operator and fastest
growing communications provider, with over 11m subscribers. Sky is the biggest commercial
supporter of the creative industries in the UK and Ireland. We invest over £2.4bn every year in
programming on news, sport, entertainment and movies. Around two thirds of Sky’s total content
spend is invested in the EU. In 2014, we will spend around £600m on original European content
and production (excluding spending on acquired rights) across all our channels, an increase of over
50% from 2011. Having built our business and reputation on sport, news and movies, the vast
majority of incremental investment is being spent on drama, entertainment, comedy and the arts.
Through our entry into broadband, we have introduced new competition and innovation, driving
broadband take up and usage, to become the UK’s second largest and fastest growing broadband
and telephony provider. In February 2013, Sky also launched broadband and telephony services in
the Republic of Ireland. Sky contributes £5.9 billion a year to UK GDP, supporting 121,000 jobs and
generating £2.7 billion of tax revenues.

Sky welcomes the Commission’s consultation on the review of the EU copyright framework on
which, as a media business providing services in the UK and Ireland, we are well placed to comment.
The audiovisual sector is subject to rapid and far-reaching change, with developments in
technology and constant innovation enabling new services to be provided via a plethora of devices
and platforms and with consumers very well served. During periods of significant change it is
particularly important lawmakers act with a greater degree of forbearance. There are two reasons
for such caution. First, the mere fact of such change is normally a good indicator that intervention
is unnecessary. Second, intervention in changing market circumstances risks doing more harm
than good.

In the time available we have focused our response on specific questions, relating to “rights and
functioning of the single market”, “limitations and exceptions in the single market”, ”fair
remuneration of authors and performers”, ”respect for rights” and “a single EU copyright title”. Our
response, which is set out in the Annex, is guided by the following principles:

           Content delivery across Europe is very dynamic, with companies constantly experimenting
            with new business models and launching innovative new content services. Consumers
            today have more choice than they have ever had before, whether in terms of pluralistic
            information or culturally diverse content, which they can consume via an ever increasing
            number of platforms and devices. Intervention must be considered carefully to ensure it
            doesn’t undermine these positive market developments;

           The current EU copyright framework already plays a key role in facilitating innovation and
            growth in the creative sector and delivers real value to the wider economy. It also has wider
            impacts on society, in terms of culture, education and basic human rights such as freedom
            of expression, which are no less important.2

           Above all, certainty in the copyright regime and in the value of IPR rights acquired under it
            provides the environment in which broadcasters and distributors are incentivised to

    This was also noted by the UK government in its response to the Hargreaves Review: http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresponse

                                                            1
         invest. The huge range and quality of content, services and technology that such
         investment has and is delivering bears testimony to this .3

        Central to this is a strong copyright framework which enshrines the right to license rights
         to programming on an exclusive basis, as such exclusivity forms the cornerstone of
         competition among television broadcasters. Broadcasters compete to a large extent by
         offering viewers programming that is not available on channels provided by their rivals. This
         enables them to attract subscribers and/or viewers to their channels. The ability to attract
         viewers to television channels is valuable for broadcasters. This value is reflected in the
         payments received by content creators, which in turn creates incentives to invest in
         content production. Sky’s investment in the creative and cultural economy is a clear
         example of the impetus that a strong copyright regime gives to dynamic companies.

        In Sky’s experience as an operator providing services in the UK and Ireland, potential
         disparities between national copyright laws (which the 2001 Copyright Directive was
         successful in reducing while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property)
         do not raise any particular issues such that commercial/contractual solutions cannot be
         reached.

        The overwhelming policy imperative at this moment, when the commercial sector is
         delivering the growth that Europe seeks, is for stability and certainty in the regulatory
         frameworks governing audiovisual content, including in the area of copyright. We have
         seen no evidence to suggest that legislative change would provide a better outcome than
         the demonstrated growth in content investment by the commercial sector. Indeed the risk
         must be that changes would reduce certainty and undermine that growth, without
         necessarily providing any counterbalancing benefits.

        We call on the Commission to ensure that copyright continues to protect creators, and
         existing legislation is properly enforced. In the areas within which Sky operates we have
         seen no evidence to suggest that legislative change would provide a better outcome than
         stability and certainty in the copyright framework, within which commercial solutions can
         generate considerable consumer benefits.

                              BSkyB response to specific questions


     I.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of
the market through licensing agreements]

[In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
provide online services across borders in the EU?
Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to
other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,
e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
In short, with one exception in relation to the acquisition of licences to musical works, Sky’s
experience as an operator providing services in the UK and Ireland, where multi-territorial services
are sought potential disparities between national copyright laws (which the 2001 Copyright
Directive was successful in reducing while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual
property) do not generally raise any particular issues such that commercial/contractual solutions
cannot be reached.

There are a number of practical considerations which inform the commercial strategy, priorities
and overall business judgement of any operator seeking to provide multi-territorial audiovisual
content services, whether online or offline. Key to success, given local cultural and linguistic
specificities, is building a good understanding of consumer preferences and interests which
requires substantial investment and expertise built over time. There are also operational
challenges to serving consumers in multiple geographical locations (including applying national
laws, building and maintaining local installation and customer service functions, adapting
reception equipment to decrypt signals within the constraints of the satellite footprint, etc.).
Taking into account these considerations, Sky has predominantly focused its operations in the UK
and Republic of Ireland, where, over many years, Sky has made substantial investments (e.g. in
developing a distribution network and in obtaining a detailed understanding of consumer
preferences) and developed significant expertise (Sky has limited experience elsewhere).

However, Sky has experienced some difficulties in acquiring licences for musical works for multi-
territorial exploitation. The problems encountered were (a) the complexity of requiring licences
from multiple collecting societies and publishers, and (b) collecting societies’ reluctance to engage
in licensing discussions for an emerging business model. We are concerned that this could result
in similar operators being unlicensed for a significant period of time with a potential delay in
licensing revenue reaching the relevant rights owners. However, we are optimistic that aspects of
the proposed collective rights management directive on multi-territorial rights for online music
services will provide a framework from which the licensing of music in audio-visual services will
become easier. As such, no further legislative intervention should be required.

                                                  3
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would
be the best way to tackle them?
N/A

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even
in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question,
you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the
one he is trying to access)?
Please explain by giving examples
As explained above, Sky hasn't acquired rights other than in the UK and Republic of Ireland, where
we've focussed our operations. We find it necessary and justified to identify the customer as
being located in either the UK or Republic of Ireland, so we can comply with our obligations to
rights owners, and be consistent with our business model, because this is where we understand
consumer preferences, local laws and can fully serve and support our customers.

Moreover, in Sky’s view, the current copyright framework and territorial distribution of audiovisual
content services incentivise copyright owners to license their rights to multiple licensees across
the European Union (through the maximisation of profitable output). At the same time, licensees
(such as Sky) are incentivised to optimise the distribution and promotion of content, including
adapting it to local customer needs (local broadcasters and distributors being best placed to do
so, for instance by adding local language commentary).

Finally, the grant of territorial exclusivity in television broadcasting is a fundamental cornerstone
of competition. If a licensee did not have territorial exclusivity it wouldn’t be prepared to invest, or
to anything like the same degree, in promoting and distributing content, as it would fear free-
riding by competitors. In this respect, we welcome Vice President of the European Commission
Joaquín Almunia’s statement, in his recent announcement on the opening of an investigation into
pay TV, that “we are not calling into question the possibility to grant licenses on a territorial basis,
or trying to oblige studios to sell rights on a pan-European basis”4.

Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
Sky does not believe that further measures are required at EU level, as companies are either
experimenting with new free and pay business models and/or have launched innovative new
content services, some of which involve the multi-territorial provision of online audio-visual
content services. Evidence of this was provided to the Commission in the context of its recent
Licences for Europe process.
Any legislative or regulatory action which seeks to interfere in the overall business judgement of

audiovisual content service providers could have highly undesirable and unforeseeable
consequences. If an operator were to be deprived of the ability to determine to whom its service
is provided and under what conditions (including conditions relating to the territories in which its
services are available) this would undermine its willingness to invest in distribution of the content,
with adverse effects on the value of rights and on consumers. Were any legislative or regulatory
action to be taken, we would caution against the risk of asymmetric regulation, which could lead
to an un-level playing field between broadcasters (who are subject to detailed regulation) and
online aggregators, who are not.

B.     Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised
(or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required
(e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)

In respect of musical works it is not clear whether the act of ‘communication to the public’ takes
place in the territory where the transmission originates or where the works are consumed, or
both. This brings uncertainty into the licensing process and the potential for multiple rights
owners to claim compensation for a single ‘restricted act.’

Sky has approached this primarily as a licensing issue which can be resolved through commercial
negotiations. In Sky’s experience as an operator providing services in the UK and Ireland, potential
uncertainty around the scope of the making available right has not, to date, posed
insurmountable obstacles to commercial/contractual resolution.



1.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights
to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?
Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems
(e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")
The application of two rights to a single act of exploitation in relation to musical works in
particular has made online music licensing unwieldy and complex. The main difficulties are in
relation to the valuation of music rights where the primary economic value to a service provider
resides in the downloaded copy not the ‘communication to the public’ right. As the two rights are
often held by different entities which negotiate separate licences with users, there is a risk that
users are charged artificially inflated costs for one act of exploitation. However, we are optimistic
that the proposed collective rights management directive which promotes Licensing Hubs may
provide a solution to this problem.

Except for the position in respect of musical works above, Sky’s experience to date as an operator
providing services in the UK and Ireland has been that the potential uncertainty around the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment has
not impeded commercial/contractual solutions.


                                                  5
2.         Download to own digital content

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Such a framework would create a strong disincentive for providers of movies to invest in
download to own platforms, as it would reduce their ability to monetise rights in subsequent
windows. An extension of the rule of exhaustion to digital content would also undermine the
digital rights market by allowing individuals or organisations to re-sell digital copies many times, at
no cost or risk to themselves, but at the expense of the whole audio-visual content value chain.

     II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
Please explain by referring to specific cases
In Sky’s view, the optionality afforded to Member States by the European copyright framework in
the area of limitations and exceptions facilitates innovation and growth in the creative sector and
serves the public and consumer interest. The dynamism of content delivery across Europe, with
companies either experimenting with new free and pay business models and/or having launched
innovative new content platforms and services is testimony to this.

For example, some UK exceptions to copyright such as time-shifting provide commercial
broadcasters (like Sky) with the certainty they require to invest in cutting edge (e.g. PVR)
technology that puts consumers in control of how and when they watch TV. This exception
provides citizens and consumers with the ability to view content at a time of their choice,
by preventing broadcasters from unduly withholding content from third party distribution
platforms which offer PVR functionality to their customers.

This is particularly important in the case of Public Service Broadcaster (PSB) content, as PSBs
benefit, under law, from advantageous positioning on their competitors’ electronic programming
guides, free access to analogue spectrum and to nation-wide terrestrial distribution. Furthermore,
Public Service Broadcasters may also have an economic interest in competing TV platforms. The
removal of copyright exceptions in the UK, or the introduction of a so-called ”Signal Integrity Right”
across the EU, would potentially enable PSBs to unduly direct licence fee payers to the
distribution platforms in which they hold an interest whilst reinforcing their strong position(s) in
advertising and/or audiovisual production and distribution markets.

We have seen no evidence to suggest that legislative change would provide a better outcome
than the flexibility which is currently afforded in this area. Indeed the risk must be that changes
would undermine market incentives for further investment in innovative platforms and services,
without necessarily providing any counterbalancing benefits.
Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
Please explain by referring to specific cases
We have seen no evidence to suggest that legislative change would provide a better outcome

                                                   6
than the flexibility which is currently afforded to Member States in this area. Indeed the risk must
be that changes would undermine market incentives for further investment in innovative
platforms and services, without necessarily providing any counterbalancing benefits.

Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
In the areas within which Sky operates we have seen no evidence to suggest that legislative
change would provide a better outcome than stability and certainty in the copyright framework.
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
Please explain why
The current EU copyright framework plays a key role in facilitating innovation and growth in the
creative sector and helps deliver real value to the wider economy. Key to this is regulatory
certainty which increased flexibility in the framework for limitations and exceptions would
undermine.
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open
norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

N/A
Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
In Sky’s experience as an operator providing services in the UK and Ireland, we have not
encountered any particular issues in this area.
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when
such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

It’s unclear how this proposal would work in practice. We can’t comment fully without further
explanation.


   III.    Private copying and reprography

In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

In line with our response to II, above, we consider that this matter should be dealt with at national
level, as a particular approach in one Member State may not be appropriate in another.
Accordingly, further clarification at European level is not required.

Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be
subject to private copying levies?


                                                  7
As above, we consider that this matter should be dealt with at national level, as a particular
approach in one Member State may not be appropriate in another.


   IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination
of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation
of your works and performances?

Authors and performers contributing to Sky content are remunerated for a) primary exploitation
of the content, and b) secondary exploitation of the content, including online use. Payments are
made either directly or through authorised trade bodies (guilds etc.).

Where existing copyright material is licensed from third party copyright owners for use in audio-
visual material, the remuneration for authors and performers for both primary and secondary
rights (including online use) is set via freely negotiated agreements and generally administered
via collecting society mechanisms.

This model of freely negotiated agreements has been adopted by the majority of providers of
audio-visual media services in the UK, and works well in practice.

Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

We do not believe there is a case for legislative intervention in this area, as the arrangements
described above work well in practice. The limitation or prohibition of certain contractual clauses
may inhibit the ability for rights owners/performers and service providers/content producers to
reach mutually beneficial agreements.

If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address
the shortcomings you identify?
N/A

      V.   Respect for rights

Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Enabling content creators to protect their copyright against theft is essential given the risk of
erosion in value of content through illegal downloads, file-sharing and streaming as the speed and
penetration of broadband coverage accelerates. Piracy destroys jobs, stifles innovation, reduces
cultural diversity and limits consumer choice.

The EU must therefore be vigilant in ensuring that the creative and content industries exist in a
robust legal environment which reduces the impact of piracy through clear rules and effective
enforcement.

In practice, much of Sky’s copyright enforcement activity targets organised crime and other forms
of criminal activity. Where criminal offences have been committed Sky often refers to and/or
works with law enforcement authorities in order to prosecute offenders.

We see value in a strengthening of existing redress mechanisms where civil infringements have


                                                 8
been committed – this includes making existing redress processes more expedient and less costly
than they are today.

In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement
of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service
providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

As both a copyright owner and internet service provider Sky is well positioned to understand the
interests of copyright owners and broadband customers in the debate on limitations of liability of
internet access providers.

The success of new services, and many existing ones, is threatened by easy access to illegal free
content However, Articles 12-14 of the e-commerce directive establish limitations on the liability of
internet intermediaries providing services consisting merely of conduit, caching and hosting. In so
far as the activities covered by Articles 12-14 are concerned, Article 15 prevents Member States
from imposing on internet intermediaries a general obligation to monitor the information which
they transmit or store or a general obligation to actively seek out facts or circumstances
indicating illegal activities.

In Sky’s experience as an internet service provider, the interpretation of these provisions has not
given rise to any particular concerns. Content owners such as Sky continue to invest in the
development of more efficient methods to identify unauthorised content and still face the
problem of indifferent hosting service providers that do not act expeditiously (if at all) on notices.
The Commission may want to consider ways to address this very specific issue.


   VI.     A single EU Copyright Title

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as
well as a single framework for enforcement?

It is unclear how a “single EU Copyright Title” would work in practice, and how such a title would be
compatible with exclusive licensing, which inter alia is a means by which broadcasters are able to
distinguish their content offerings from those of their competitors and in turn provide content
owners with revenue which they reinvest in content. We would therefore call on the Commission
to carry out a full impact assessment before going too far in designing legislative intervention
which could undermine exclusive licensing.

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term
project?
In Sky’s experience as an operator providing services in the UK and Ireland, potential disparities
between national copyright laws (which the 2001 Copyright Directive was successful in reducing
while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property) do not raise any particular
issues such that commercial/contractual solutions cannot be reached. We therefore do not
believe there is a need for a” single EU Copyright Title”, in particular at a time when content
delivery across Europe is very dynamic, with companies either experimenting with new free and
pay business models and/or having launched innovative new content services.
