                                              I. Rights and the functioning
                                                 of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


            1.  [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you
               faced problems when trying to access online services  in  an
               EU Member State other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

               across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

            3. [In particular if you are a right  holder  or  a  collective
               management organisation:] How often are you asked  to  grant
               multi-territorial licences? Please  indicate,  if  possible,
               the  number  of  requests  per  year  and  provide  examples
               indicating the Member State, the  sector  and  the  type  of
               content concerned.


Since we started our business and work we always saw the whole world as  our
market. The Internet made it possible  for  us  to  sell  worldwide  without
having huge amounts of money. And in let´s say 90% of our  license  requests
we were asked for  worldwide  territory,  or  at  least  a  continent  as  a
territory (like North America, Europe, Asia…)


If you have identified problems in the  answers  to  any  of  the  questions
above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


I think we need a EU wide platform of law so that  digital  content  can  be
available from every country in the EU. But it cannot be  on  the  shoulders
of rights holders, which means that  all  rights  holders  must  be  treated
equal and their creations and contents needs to be protected.


            4. [In particular if you are a right  holder  or  a  collective
               management organisation:] Are there  reasons  why,  even  in
               cases where you hold all the necessary rights  for  all  the
               territories in question, you would still find  it  necessary
               or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service
               provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that  access  to
               certain  content  is  not  possible  in   certain   European
               countries)?

            5. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster  or  a  service
               provider:] Are there reasons why, even in  cases  where  you
               have  acquired  all  the  necessary  rights  for   all   the
               territories in question, you would still find  it  necessary
               or justified  to  impose  territorial  restrictions  on  the
               service recipient (in order for instance,  to  redirect  the
               consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to
               access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

            6. Do you think that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-
               legislative, including market-led solutions) are  needed  at
               EU  level  to  increase  the  cross-border  availability  of
               content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
               adequate level of protection for right holders?


x YES – Please explain


In these days when all countries are connected through  the  Internet  there
should be more solutions for cross-border availability of  content  services
and end-users should have easy access to legal content. But same time  there
should be much more copyright protection for rights holders. Pirate  website
see no borders and big corporations that make  a  living  from  hosting  3rd
party creative content should pay a  fair  share  of  their  income  to  the
rights holders (for example Youtube). Also market dominating  surch  engines
like Google should be forced to give better protection to  creative  content
by erasing known pirate sites from their search results.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


            7. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
               situations  –  i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across
               borders – sufficiently clear?


€ YES

x NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])

I think this is not clear because otherwise we would have  not  this  “free”
content market called the Internet. No matter in which country a  server  is
located, if illegal content comes  from  this  server,  then  it  should  be
blocked from the internet.


€ NO OPINION


            8.  [In  particular  if  you  are  a   right   holder:]   Could
               a clarification of the  territorial  scope  of  the  “making
               available” right have an effect on the recognition  of  your
               rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an  author  or
               not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred  your
               rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the  enforcement
               of  rights  (including  the   availability   of   injunctive
               relief[2])?


x YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


If we give our creative content to a digital distributor for  the  territory
world then this does not mean that we give it out for free. This means  that
every content provider has to clear that  he  licenes  the  rights  for  his
territory (domestic or international) so he can start his business.  When  I
started as a record company to press music on vinyl and CD I knew I  had  to
license it from the German GEMA, like everyone else. It  was  my  choice  to
work as a record label, and to work on a lega basis, so  I  chose  that  way
and had to pay for those licenses. I made also a big minus in the  past  but
that was my own personal business decision and I cannot  blame  the  artists
for this. If a content provider in the digital age starts a new business  he
also has to license the content he  makes  his  business  from.  Because  he
makes money by using the creative work of other people, so you can say  they
are part of his team, so they also have to be paid like a team member.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


            9.  [In particular  if  you  a  service  provider  or  a  right
               holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single  act
               of economic exploitation in the online environment  (e.g.  a
               download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


           10. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading  to  a  work  or
               other subject matter protected under  copyright,  either  in
               general or under specific circumstances, be subject  to  the
               authorisation of the rightholder?


x YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


Because it is my work and also the work of creative artists who spent  their
time and money on creating personalised content that  stands  out  from  the
rest. Just because it is so easy in the digital  age  to  steal  it  doesn´t
mean it should be legal or that other people can build a business  model  on
illegally exploiting protected works. Every content creator should  be  able
to choose for himself if he wants to give out his creations for free  or  if
he wants to be paid.


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

           11. Should the viewing of a  web-page  where  this  implies  the
               temporary reproduction of a work  or  other  subject  matter
               protected under copyright on the screen  and  in  the  cache
               memory of the user’s computer, either in  general  or  under
               specific circumstances, be subject to the  authorisation  of
               the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


x NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


I think that watching a website in  the  internet  should  not  be  illegal,
because  then  it  is  already  too  late.  The  creator  of  a  website  is
responsible for what he loads on his website and should be made  liable  for
that. The normal internet user often does not know the legal  situation  and
mostly thinks that if something is available it cannot be illegal.

Download to own digital content

  13.  [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


I think this would have a negative  consequence  on  the  price  of  digital
content, because very soon after the release  date  the  creation  would  be
sold for a fragment of the sales price. Because it is  already  so  easy  to
copy an mp3 or movie file and exchange it via so many  different  platforms,
external hard drives, etc music and other creative works are  already  being
handed around for free a lot. Is the price going  down  more  and  more  the
result will be that nearly no money  comes  back  to  the  creating  artist,
which destroys his platform for creating more.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


x YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


Registered songs would can be found much easier because all are in one  pan-
European system and those that are looking  for  those  songs  in  terms  of
licensing can access all info easily. This will increase  the  usability  of
all creative works because it  would  not  be  important  any  more  of  the
system, that one uses to search for a work, is connected to  the  system  in
the country the works is registered in.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


I do not see any disadvantage of such a  system  because  this  should  have
been the standard already 10 years ago. For example if you  look  for  music
and infos on the composer you just go to Discogs in the internet and  mostly
find everything there. Why do collecting societies and  copyright  societies
still lack this connection?





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


To make it easier to find info about their music  and  license  it  to  make
some money out of it at the end.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


The EU should oversee the availability of information  and  make  sure  that
there is a legal platform and registration and  license  basis  EU  wide  so
tech corporations cannot say that  these  copyright  laws  block  innovation
because they have to negotiate contracts with every country.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

x YES – Please explain


I see no need to shorten the  current  length  in  copyright  protection  to
corporations can exploit what creative people have worked out. Just  because
everything nowadays goes faster through computers and the internet  it  does
not mean that creativity has a shorter life too.


€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

x YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


I think in call EU member states there should be the same  laws  that  every
member has to follow. For example corporations should have to pay a  certain
amount of money for the production of empty media formats  such  as  sticks,
external hard drives, etc which are  made  for  copying  data  and  creative
content.  And that everywhere!


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


Same rules for everybody!!


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


I think in the internet and computer world exchanging  creative  content  is
made too easy and creators of works loose big load of money  where  creators
of technological hardware and website giving out content for free  make  the
money that should go to the real  creators  of  the  works  that  is  handed
around.


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X  NO – Please explain why


Not at all because  of  all  those  already  existing  loop  holes  creative
content producers are robbed every day and a lot had  to  stop  doing  their
creative job because nearly  no  money  came  in  anymore.  The  shift  from
physical products to digital products  ended  where  the  internet  provided
those creative products mostly for free. Just go and type a song, an  album,
a game, a movie, etc into google  and  you  can  be  sure  to  find  illegal
download sites on the first result page. It became  easier  to  get  content
free (means illegally free) than to find it for money. This is so wrong!


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

X YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


Territorial limitations and expectations just make the way to  the  creative
content producer much more difficult  and  it  becomes  harder  for  him  to
receive his money, if there is money he  can  receive.  If  there  would  be
let´s say only exceptions for schools then everyone had  to  play  with  the
same rules.


€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION





  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Of course we had numerous, really uncountable situations where we found  our
content on for free download on illegal download sites,  blogs  or  even  in
commercial short videos on Youtube. But what can  you  do  in  these  times?
NOTHING when you are just a little fish and not a major corporation. In  the
begging we sent numerous take-down notices but this fight cannot be  won  if
our governments do nothing to improve the legal situation for us.

      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


Of course we experienced problems. This question sounds  more  like  a  joke
for me. Everybody kinda knows that all these corporations make it  hard  for
you to really fight this fight for your right. At the end  you   lose  cause
you cannot pay one or two extra person for  sending  take-down  notices  all

      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?


Yes, for the use of our work in the USA. When  I  heard  that  SoundExchange
collects digital royalties from internet radio  stations  I  contacted  them
first by phone, which was nearly impossible to  get  somebody  on  the  line
there. Then by email several times and either nobody replied or the  replies
were not really answers to my questions. I really had the feeling they  were
not making it easy for artists and labels to receive their money.  And  that
they kind of did on purpose.

By having equal rights and duties for all content  providers  so  the  legal

A website like Google should be classified as the same business  model  like
Itunes for example and pay  the  same  royalties  for  the  music  it  uses,
markets and makes  money  from.  They  are  a  content  provider  for  100%,
actually the biggest streaming service worldwide.

      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

A EU wide registration network of collection  societies  that  ensures  that
all authors and composers can be recognized  when  works  are  exploited  so
everyone gets his fair share.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

X YES


Yes of course, because the last years showed that people and  companies  did
not fear punishment and illegally exploited creative  works  in  uncountable
cases. And they got away with it and make a fortune of  money  from  content
that never had the rights for exploiting them.

                                                 Title

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

This is already long overdue and must be the next step in copyright  in  the
EU. The EU is a connected business market and that  not  only  for  physical
products but digital as well. But copyright  in  the  digital  market  is  a
neglected thing and normally this should have been taken care of  more  than
10 years ago when the internet became THE new market.


 VII. Other issues

      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
