                             Public Consultation 
                    on the review of the EU copyright rules
PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:

Name: The Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society. 
The Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society Limited (ALCS) is a UK collective rights management organisation representing the interests of authors. The current membership includes creators working across diverse genres for print, audio, audio-visual and digital publications. Established in 1977 and wholly owned and governed by the authors it represents (of whom there are currently over 85,000) ALCS is a not-for-profit, non-union organisation. ALCS exists to ensure that authors receive a fair reward when their works are used in situations in which it would be impossible or impractical to offer licences on an individual basis. To date ALCS has paid over Pound350m to authors. 
In responding to this consultation ALCS has focussed on issues of greatest relevance to its members and areas of operation.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.
* [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
 YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

* [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

* [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned. 

EU policy on cross border access has naturally focussed on musical works due to the potential for such works to have pan - European appeal. While the works ALCS licenses on behalf of its members  -  books, journals, TV/radio scripts  -  have clear sales potential within European markets, considerations such as cultural and linguistic differences have a significant impact in determining how these markets operate. This in turn suggests that market-led solutions will be more appropriate than policy directives in the context of accessibility within the single market. Where demand for multi-territory access arises, ALCS is working with UK and European partners to provide licensing solutions.  
ALCS member's published works, such as books and journals (including digital editions), are licensed through the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) for international exploitation. Through its Multinational Licences CLA is developing terms enabling businesses to copy and share materials amongst their employees irrespective of the user's location within Europe. 

ALCS is a member of the Society of Audiovisual Authors (SAA), a collective of European CMOs representing scriptwriters and directors. SAA members are developing models for offering on-line service providers operating across multiple European territories a centralised rights-clearance system.

* [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?

* Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
 YES  -  Please explain 
In the sectors in which ALCS operates, for the reasons outlined above, we support market-led solutions. This approach is supported firstly by the existing networks of CMOs operating within Europe providing a platform for development of new licensing models and partnerships, and secondly by collaborative initiatives to establish common systems and processes for exchanging licensing data. With regard to the latter, through its membership of the European Writers Council ALCS is supporting the work of the Linked Content Coalition in developing its Rights Data Integration Project; ALCS also plays an active part in the technical / standards committees within bodies such as IFRRO and CISAC.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 

* Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
 YES 
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
.............................................................................................................
.............................................................................................................
 NO OPINION
 
* [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
 YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
For many years ALCS has worked with partner CMOs around Europe to establish licensing and remuneration networks supporting the retransmission of national TV services amongst European territories. As TV services migrate onto digital platforms, the making available right becomes increasingly relevant to this kind of cross-border access. To provide adequate protection for the authors and other rightsholders in such productions, making available rights should be recognised both in the licences enabling the original distribution and the licences and remuneration rights applicable to cases of retransmission in the territory where the work is ultimately accessed.    
 NO
 NO OPINION
Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
.............................................................................................................
.............................................................................................................
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).
* [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)? 
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples
.............................................................................................................

 NO
 NO OPINION
* [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]

Authors are already disadvantaged by re-sales of their works. The emergence of on-line retail has greatly expanded the market for re-selling books with most current titles marketed by publishers simultaneously being sold elsewhere as `used' copies. For many sellers operating in this high-volume re-sale market, their revenue model is based around a low-sale price for the book offset by a fixed share of the shipping costs. In effect therefore the same book, in the same condition, can either be sold through a publisher at or near the retail price with the author receiving a royalty, or as a `used' sale at a fraction of the retail price with no remuneration paid to the author. If this became a legitimised practice for e-books, where even a superficial distinction between new and used copies becomes irrelevant, it is hard to see how publishers would recoup sufficient returns to pay their authors and invest in new talent. 
Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
 YES 
 NO 
 NO OPINION

* What would be the possible advantages of such a system? 
[Open question]

A register may have some advantages in the context of orphan works. Assuming a work can only be entered onto an orphan works register once the relevant diligent searches have taken place, a register could lend authenticity to the definition of such works, avoid duplication of searches and provides a resource for rightsholders to check against. However there are also significant practical considerations associated with this approach, such as creating commonly adopted terms by which works are identified on the register and the challenges inherent in linking national data sets on searches and works into a single database at an EU level. 
* What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system? 
[Open question]
We outline the practical considerations associated with an EU-level register in our answer to the previous question.   

* What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question] 
The main incentive for rightholders in any registration system should be the opportunity for greater efficiencies in licensing others to access and exploit their works; this is the paradigm on which the UK's Copyright Hub is being built. It follows, as a matter of principle, that any such registration system should be entirely voluntary. 
We believe it would be wholly inappropriate for the EU to try and devise an incentives system whereby certain works were effectively afforded different levels of protection by virtue of their appearance on a register.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]
A new international standard can be very difficult to get off the ground, even where there is a consensus that there is a clear need for it. This occurs because organisations prefer to wait until the standard has been widely implemented by others in their sector before they are willing to devote technical and financial resources to implementing it themselves. The organisation that is maintaining and promoting the standard has to bear the financial burden both of developing and of promoting the standard while organisations are persuaded to commit. Financial support from the EU would be valuable in these circumstances. 

There is a series of international standard identifiers that should form the basis of interoperable rights ownership and permissions databases. Some are relatively new and their use has not yet achieved critical mass, others are widely used. Published EU guidance on which identifiers are considered to be key elements in such databases would help to establish this set of standards and would encourage developers to build in an interoperable way.
Attempts to develop interoperable rights ownership and permissions databases will probably reveal the need for further identifiers and standardized communication schemas. Others will need to be adapted as circumstances change. Such identifiers and schemas are generally developed and maintained by committee and by consensus. The work to thrash out the technical details, to clarify the wording, and to achieve the consensus, can be spread out over years. EU support for the groups who carry out these tasks could allow the work to be carried out more intensively, with the result that results could be seen sooner.

Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 
* Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
 YES  -  The digital environment permits the revival and reuse of older works to a far greater extent than ever before. As such, the current copyright terms provide an appropriate level of protection for authors, taking account of the potential for works in archives and back catalogues to be subject to new commercial and non-commercial uses.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations. 
* Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? 
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases 
.............................................................................................................
.............................................................................................................
 NO  -  Please explain
According to Recital 32 of the Copyright Directive, the rationale for providing an extensive, optional list of exceptions is to take due account of the different legal traditions and markets in Member States while enabling the internal market to function. This approach acknowledges the fact that while rights are granted in a relatively uniform way, the limitations applied to those rights and any compensation for such limitation may be applied quite differently. For example, in the case of a book being copied for educational use, Member States may permit this subject to a voluntary licence, a statutory licence or a remuneration scheme.  Through the network of agreements signed between European Reproduction Rights Organisations, any necessary mandates to copy works are secured and remuneration is exchanged. In this way the flexible nature of the exceptions regime enables the educational uses and rightholder payments across the EU.    

 NO OPINION

* Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
 YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases

 NO  -  Please explain
The current system providing for a broad range of optional exceptions works well for the reasons given above.

* Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 YES  -  Please explain why 
.............................................................................................................
.............................................................................................................
 NO  -  Please explain why
The current system providing for a broad range of optional exceptions provides a flexible framework recognising the diversity of legal systems, licensing structures and markets within the EU.     
 NO OPINION

* If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question] 
To provide a degree of flexibility as to how exceptions are applied, the Copyright Directive incorporates the three step test in Article 5(5). The test provides key principles which may then be subject to judicial interpretation in the context of particular cases arising within Member States. This approach based on principles is flexible both in terms of its application to varied legal systems and in relation to changing technologies that may impact on the activities undertaken under exceptions. 

* Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?

 NO OPINION

* In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
 [Open question] 

Our answer to question 21 highlights the fact that different models may apply in different Member States to achieve the same objective, such as providing access to material for educational or personal use. In some cases exceptions are applied subject to compensation, in others voluntary licences mediate the relationship between use under exceptions and compensation for rightsholders. Problems will arise if the regime in a particular territory deviates significantly from these structures, for example by providing that certain activities are exempt from compensation/ licensing, which in turn creates artificial incentives for the establishment of markets and cross-border trade in that territory.  
         
* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

*  (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

* [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
.............................................................................................................
.............................................................................................................

* [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

Traditional library activities, whether loaning copies of works or providing access to material for reference on the premises, are limited by the necessity of users visiting the library to secure access to the content they want. Public Libraries are often also limited in the quantity and range of material they offer due to constraints in public funding. These limitations help to differentiate the non-commercial activities of libraries, for which copyright exceptions and rights to compensation are relevant from the commercial exploitation of works, concerning exclusive rights and licensing. 

One of the impacts of digital technology is to give libraries the opportunity to provide off-site access to works. This has the potential to significantly increase the level of works being accessed: downloading to PC or mobile is much easier than visiting the library; unlike the physical product, a digital copy of a work may be accessed simultaneously by multiple users. This has the potential to bring library activities closer to commercial access models but without the same rights protections or licensing income. 

A recent review of e-lending in the UK included the following recommendations:

The interests of publishers and booksellers must be protected by building in frictions that set 21st-century versions of the limits to supply which are inherent in the physical loans market (and where possible, opportunities for purchase should be encouraged). These frictions include the lending of each digital copy to one reader at a time, that digital books could be securely removed after lending and that digital books would deteriorate after a number of loans.  The exact nature of these frictions should evolve over time to accommodate changes in technology and the market.

Models such as these would enable library access and commercial sales to continue to co-exist while embracing the benefits of new technologies. However this move towards e-lending (and the wider debate referred to in the consultation paper on cross-border e-lending) can only progress if the necessary structures are in place to ensure that authors are fairly and transparently compensated for library loans. The EU has further work to do to ensure that all Member States provide for compensation schemes that are funded adequately and treat authors equally irrespective of their nationality.             

ALCS is working with the European Writers Council and Federation of European Publishers on a survey of current EU e-lending strategies; we look forward to sharing the results of this review with the Commission.        

Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home. 
* (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

[Open question]

Educational use is a high-volume market demanding both quantity and breadth of material. Facilitating this kind of use requires solutions involving multiple rightsholders and rights. In the UK such solutions have been developed by building upon the exceptions providing for teaching activities.
Section 36 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988) permits educational establishments to copy limited extract from books, serials and other materials for teaching purposes but also makes provision for licences covering educational copying. Through the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) bodies representing the relevant rightsholders in such works  -  ALCS for authors, DACS for artists and PLS for publishers  -  have developed schemes enabling far greater uses than those envisaged by the exception. These include extensions to digital formats of works, use of works on smartboards and distance learning via on-line networks. 
Section 35 of the Act permits educational establishments to make recordings from broadcasts but, like section 36, also permits the operation of a licensing scheme. Through the Educational Recording Agency (ERA) ALCS and 19 other bodies representing the various rightsholders in audiovisual works provide a licensing scheme covering the different ways that broadcast material is accessed and used within modern teaching methods. The licensing scheme has expanded beyond the exception by including new digital services within licensed repertoire and offering remote access rights to facilitate distance learning.    
These licences achieve a near 100% penetration within the UK education sector providing flexible access to hundreds of thousands of works licensed by thousands of individual rightsholders. The success of these models is supported by two key findings from recent research in this area. Firstly, it has been demonstrated that educational licensing schemes generate significant costs savings for educational establishments. Economic analysis within Higher Education has found that the annual cost of clearing secondary use rights for individual published works would be between Pound145m - Pound720m, whereas the overall annual cost of a collective licence for this sector is around Pound6.7m.  For schools, the cost of a licence enabling them to copy and reuse extracts from all the books and serials in their collections represents 0.03% of their annual spend; the annual cost to a high school of accessing and copying UK broadcast material is less than 60p per pupil.  Secondly, it is clear that licensing revenue has a key role to play in sustaining the development of new educational materials. Economic analysis demonstrates that a reduction in this income could result in a drop in output amongst authors writing for the education sector of 29%, equating to an annual shortfall of 2,870 new educational works.

[Open question]

The ALCS experience is that the UK model outlined above provides a solution that sets the right balance between access rights and rewards for rightsholders to the overall benefit of the teaching and education sector. This approach lessens uncertainties around the scope of activities covered by teaching exceptions by enabling rightholders to offer a broad range of material and rights.

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.

* What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research purposes? How successful are they? 
[Open question]

The UK Copyright Act includes exceptions permitting fair dealing with works for research purposes. These apply to a broader range of works and activities than is envisaged in the wording of the research exception in the Copyright Directive. Generally these exceptions are limited to access by individuals undertaking research. To facilitate wider use and enable multiple users to access copies of the same material simultaneously, the UK licensing models outlined above provide comprehensive coverage. 

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).
* (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States' implementation of this exception?

Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

Where new business models emerge around creations involving new and existing copyright works, licensing solutions can offer access to consumers and protections for the authors concerned.         

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.


ALCS General Comment:

Most EU Member States operate systems compensating authors when consumers copy their works for personal use. Although ALCS members receive these payments from Europe, the UK currently has no such system, we are therefore not in a position to respond to the specific questions below concerning the operation of levies. However, we believe the following principle should be central to a balanced EU policy in this area:   

The ability to consume works in a flexible way is driving new commercial markets drawing consumers to new digital products and services.  In the interests of sustainability, authors creating the content upon which these markets are based should be fairly included within these new value chains.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary. 
* [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]  

An optimal mechanism to ensure authors receive adequate remuneration for the exploitation of their works would include the following elements: 

* Agreed industry standards, endorsed by the relevant trade bodies, governing the contracts offered to authors by publishers/ producers, 
* Such standards to provide for transparency in terms of, inter alia: rights transferred moral rights; durations of transfers/licences; schedules detailing payments for different uses; reporting on uses and payments; reversion of rights.              
* Access to membership of an approved CMO to exploit and remunerate those rights required by contract or law to be exercised on a collective basis.      
    

* Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 
 YES  -  Please explain 

The conclusions from a recent study on creator contracts undertaken on behalf of the Directorate General for Internal Policies provides a useful template for further EU action in this area: 
"Two key objectives should guide any EU intervention in the field of copyright contracts. First, the real contractual nature of copyright contracts should be restored: authors agree on some reciprocal bargain for effective exploitation and fair remuneration should be the counterpart of the transfer of copyright. Second, copyright contracts should be addressed within the broader picture of the exploitation of creative content, which requires consideration of the articulation of such contracts with other contractual relationships and exploitations undertaken by all stakeholders."
We urge the Commission to develop a clear strategy and timetable for implementing the recommendations from this study.

Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES  -  Please explain 
Authors face huge challenges in monitoring the unauthorised use of their works online across the EU. Even when works are removed from infringing sites they will often reappear elsewhere, soon after. Currently the system is unbalanced  -  EU and global intellectual property policymakers need to support mechanisms that facilitate greater discovery of infringing uses and promote efficient systems for removing the works, such as accessible and transparent notice and take-down processes.

* In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
