  Say Yes to culture in Europe with creators, and Say No to the dismantling
                          of your rights in Europe!

  React to the European Commission’s public consultation – Sign this Call!

The future of culture, creators and cultural industries  in  Europe  depends
on the outcome of  a  consultation  on  copyright  being  conducted  by  the
European Commission with a deadline for submissions of 5th February 2014.

We want Europe to make culture a priority. We want Europe  to  give  culture
its true place at the heart of the European economy.

We want European Institutions, candidates, political parties  and  heads  of
State to say Yes to culture in Europe, Yes to millions of jobs, Yes  to  the
artists and Yes to the people of  Europe,  who  could  not  breathe  without
culture in their lives.

We want them to sustain and develop the cultural  industries,  which  depend
on  copyright  to  sustain  millions  of  jobs  and   secure   millions   of
livelihoods.

Today, we urge you, the citizens of the European Union, to voice your  views
by answering the European Commission public consultation, and to  sign  this
petition, which will be sent to the  President  of  the  Commission  and  to
Commissioners, who will soon present a White Paper.

Sign the petition to secure the future of European culture.
