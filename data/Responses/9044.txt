E.        Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20 . Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

                                                                                            1
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

X NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
From the perspective of libraries and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands
the current terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) are
too long. Cultural heritage institutions hold large collections of works that are still under
copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not exploited
commercially anymore. A term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast
with the commercial life of the large majority of copyright protected works that much
shorter. As a result the disproportionate length of copyright protection prevents our
institutions from effectively fulfilling our public interest mission in the digital
environment.
In many cases the cost for digitisation of copyrighted works that are no longer in
commercial exploitation exceeds the potential economic value of these works. As a result
these are not made available online by the right holders or publishers who lack an
economic incentive. While cultural heritage institutions that own such works have an
incentive to make such works available (it is our public task to provide access to our
collections) they are confronted with costs for rights clearance that are prohibitively
high due to the required diligent searches for the right holder(s) of every work (often
heirs).
One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so called ‘20th century black hole’
when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works. Works from the 20th century
are significantly less likely to be available than works from the centuries before (many of
which are clearly in the public domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still
available commercially).
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of out-of-commerce works
that are in copyright and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above.
Given this, the term of copyright protection should be reduced to the minimum
requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). This
could be a first step towards a more significant reduction of term of protection that
would require a revision of the Berne Convention; the European Union should work in
the relevant international fora to further reduce the term. This should include efforts to
agree on a system where extended copyright protection after an initial automatically
granted term would be only granted if the work is registered by the right holder. The
duration of the initial term should be brought into line with the duration of protection of
other IP rights such as patented inventions (20 years) databases (15 years) and
industrial design rights (25 years). Also compare the Lisbon Council Policy Brief by P.B.
Hugenholtz and I. Hargreaves:
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/LisbonCouncil_policybrief.pdf.
In addition it should be examined if it is possible to establish a cut-off date for copyright
protection that ensures that all works published before that date are not protected by
copyright anymore. Such a cut-off date could vary by sector (European Film Heritage
institutions for example advocate 1920 as a cut-off date for cinematographic works).

  II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The purpose of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society was explicitly (as its title shows)
to create more harmonisation within the EU. Ironically, it ends in a situation of non-
harmonisation. Limitations and exceptions vary a lot from country to country. Only one
exception is mandatory today: the exception for temporary copies (whether this
could/should be regarded as an act of reproduction was also discussed at WIPO in
1996).
In addition to this situation of non-harmonisation, the list of exceptions was made
exhaustive, so no exceptions could be adjusted or expanded to similar uses, and no new
exceptions could be added despite the fact that the world and the information market is
ever changing.
It is in the library’s missions to cooperate and share resources across borders. For the
European library community the existence of 28 different copyright regimes with their
own exceptions makes this cooperation more difficult. One example is that the definition
of “non-commercial” differs from country to country. For other differences see K.
Crews’ Study on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries and Archives
written for WIPO at www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/sccr_17/sccr_17_2.pdf.
The current situation creates an uneven playing field. Users of the same type should be
able to enjoy the same exceptions (user rights) in all member states. Cultural Heritage
Institutions are increasingly working together on digitisation projects (for example in
the context Europeana) and the fact that the exceptions benefitting publicly accessible
libraries, museums and archives have not been implemented (uniformly) in all
member states, creates unnecessary uncertainties and disadvantages institutions in some
member states vis-a-vis institutions in others.
The 'New renaissance' report on bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online specifically
recommended such collaborations between institutions. The lack of harmonization
introduces unnecessary friction costs for institutions engaging in cross border
collaborations.
The lack of harmonisation and the optional character of the list of exceptions creates an
ambiguous situation throughout the EU. Especially when several Member States work
together in cross-border projects such as:
-      Europeana and all the related projects whose missions are to give online access to
       European Cultural Heritage;
-      the European Library;
-      the EU arctic centre, whose mission is, among others to develop knowledge and
       spread information on the region (http://www.arcticcentre.org/InEnglish/ABOUT-
       US/EU-Arctic-Information-Centre) or the Upper Rhin University;
-      all other cross-border projects shared by several Member States trying to pool
       resources to the benefit of their population and to develop mutual understanding
       and reciprocal knowledge. All those structures work with libraries that are
       supposed to give access to their collection (including digital ones), but can be
       forbidden to do so because of different copyright regimes and absence of



                                                                                         3
      harmonised exceptions in the respective Member States. In addition, this lack of
      harmonisation is even more of an obstacle when projects involve non-EU states.
The transition to digital services enables libraries and cultural heritage institutions to
collaborate across borders and make their collections available across all of Europe and
this needs to be mirrored by harmonising the exceptions benefitting these institutions.
The most comprehensive way to address this issue would be to establish a unified EU
copyright title (compare our answer to Q 78).

  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
All existing and additional exceptions for libraries museums and archives should be
made mandatory and non-overridable. They should be harmonised to the fullest extent
possible, after they have been broadened and new ones have been added in line with our
response here below. It is not acceptable that citizens in some members state enjoy a
lesser level of access to the collections held by publicly funded libraries and cultural
heritage institutions simply because of an uneven implementation of exceptions and
limitations of the InfoSoc Directive. This issue becomes more pressing as more and more
activities of these institutions are taking place online. Moreover, a vitally important issue
is that contracts should not be able to override limitations and exceptions.
All the current exceptions in the EU InfoSoc Directive are drafted on the basis that they
do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and, therefore, do not
unreasonably prejudice right holders. This means that making them mandatory in all
Member States should have no negative effect on right holders, while in many cases this
will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to
knowledge and culture or inclusive education. Moreover, the current exception for
libraries, archives and museums in Article 5.2(c) is quite open in the way that it allows
“specific acts of reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments or museums, or by archives, which are not for direct or indirect
economic or commercial advantage”, but it is an exception for the reproduction right
ONLY, and it does not cover any other library activity that would be considered fair use
in a more flexible legislation. One example is that the transmission of single scanned
articles or other pieces of information (like one single scanned poem) to individual users
or other libraries, on request, is considered as communication to the public and
therefore needs to be licensed. In the analogue world this is covered by an exception in
most countries. This is a case that in our opinion clearly would pass the three step test,
as it is a specific case and do not harm the interests of the author.
Additionally, to address technological change that has already occurred, the revised
Directive should include new mandatory exceptions. With regard to libraries the status
of e-lending should be clarified (see the answers to questions 37 and 38), possibly via a
new exception. Off-premises or remote access for registered users would be one of the
situations which also need to be covered by new exceptions. In addition, cultural

                                                                                           4
heritage institutions need to be enabled to make out-of-commerce works in their
collections available online for non-commercial purposes, by expanding the scope of the
existing provision in Article 5(3)n of the Directive. Thus, a functional exception (unlike
the one in the Orphan Works Directive) should be created for mass digitisation and
making available Out of Commerce Works by libraries, archives and museums for non-
commercial purposes. Moreover, new exceptions are desirable for text and data mining,
for non-commercial sharing for protected works by individuals, for research and
education purposes, plus Open Access legislation. Finally there is a need to introduce an
open norm (see also our responses to Q32-34).

  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
All current existing exceptions have to remain. We do not want to remove already
existing exceptions, only add new ones and find a more flexible solution than the current
one. To list any new specific exceptions that will take into account any new technological
development in years to come would not prove to be useful. The current list should
therefore be combined with more general principles like an open norm, “fair use” or
“similar use”.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
X YES – Please explain why
Referring to our earlier responses, there is indeed a need for more flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions. The exceptions and limitations in
the InfoSoc Directive were not drafted in a technologically neutral manner which is
problematic in times of accelerated technological progress. We repeat the need for a
more flexible and open solution. Most exceptions are too narrow and specific, even for
2001 when they were written. Also see the report of P.B. Hugenholtz and M.R.F.
Senftleben, Fair Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR, Amsterdam, available at
www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/Fair%20Use%20Report%20PUB.pdf.
Copyright seeks to balance the rights of authors and rights holders with those of users .
This balance has been damaged in the past years with only the rights holders benefiting.
The main objective of copyright reform at the European level should be to maintain
those rights and re-establish a new balance where innovation, research as well as legal
access to digital content will be encouraged. Therefore, Copyright law shall balance the
right to access, share and use copyrighted works with the author’s right to protection
and compensation.
Now we have a situation of imbalance, with the exhaustive list of non-mandatory
exceptions, increasing terms of protection (the last one was for sound recordings, in

                                                                                        5
2011), cumbersome, expensive and monopolistic licensing models for libraries for
electronic journals and books. Libraries have always been important contributors to the
revenues, especially for academic and research publishers, and are paying for what they
acquire. More generally, a recent press release of the British Library shows that “The
economic value that the library delivers is now almost five times its costs, representing a
return on investment of 5:1” and therefore that libraries, archives and information
services have an important role to play in boosting the economy. A competitive market
can only innovate by relying on well-educated and informed citizens and consistent
investment in libraries, archives and information services. This generates a good return
on investment and stimulates the economy.
However there is a need to establish fair conditions applying to libraries, archives and
cultural heritage institutions as a whole and not only to right holders. Rules that apply
in the commercial environment (especially for films and music) shall apply differently in
public institutions that do seek a direct or indirect economic interest.
Compared to institutions in countries that have a more flexible approach to exceptions
and limitations European institutions face a competitive disadvantage. Compare for
example the scope of the Google books project in the US and in Europe: in Europe
Google and the libraries are only digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the US the
project also includes in copyright titles. As a result citizens of the US have better access
to their recent (20th century) culture than European citizens.

  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use fits this
description. It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22) and in
addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations. As long as an open norm is
implemented EU wide its effect on the functioning of the single market would be
minimal while it can be expected to improve the competitive position of European
market actors vis a vis market participants in other jurisdictions that have an open
norm.
More reliance on court decisions may be a consequence of an open norm and more
flexibility in copyright legislation. Court decisions take time, but as more court decisions
are made, the pattern of the fair use concept becomes more predictable. Court cases
could however be extremely costly and should not be the only way of seeking for a
solution.


                                                                                             6
Creating new EU legislation would be even slower than court cases, especially, and
couldn’t reply immediately to the need for new exceptions and limitations as the need
arises. But the advantages of an ambitious legislative approach, open to keep pace with
social and technological changes would be a good sign of the European will to contribute
to the building of the 21st Knowledge Society and of the EU not willing to lag behind
American or Asian front runners.
A European Copyright code could be one alternative.
A citizens’ initiative on the need for extensive exceptions and limitations for libraries,
archives and museums calling on the European Commission to make a legislative
proposal on this issue could be an option (albeit very challenging) (cf.
http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome).

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
X YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
At present, the EU only obliges EU countries to adopt one exception (regarding
temporary acts of reproduction), while the adoption of the others is optional. As a result,
something that is legal in one country could be illegal elsewhere. In digitisation and
online projects it is unclear whether certain national exceptions also apply in the
country of the partner institute. Many heritage institutions are faced with the fact that
right holders or CMOs are not willing to provide licences to participate in pan-
European projects such as Europeana.
Another example, the UK is the only Member State without a private copying exception,
so an act that is legal in Spain or the Netherlands suddenly becomes a criminal offence
in the UK. Finland hardly has a parody exception, so a work considered legal in
Germany could be infringing copyright in Finland. From a research perspective, this
means that researchers have difficulties working together and sharing knowledge across
borders. Currently, for example, inter-library loans are hampered across borders.
Right owners and service providers based in stricter jurisdictions often do not accept the
wider scope of freedoms in other jurisdictions and attempt to limit it contractually or
use technical measures. Moreover, most licences impose the law of the state of the
publisher and not that of the subscribing institution, and this leads to the paradox that
publishers from different Member States are contractually not subject to national laws
(including exceptions to copyright) even if they are protected by copyright via national
laws. This, coupled with the fact that there cannot be a tender among several
competitors for the provision of copyright protected content that can be provided just
by a single company, often makes it difficult for libraries to obtain licences really
suitable to their needs, even when their national legislation (copyright law, contract law,
public procurement law, privacy law, etc.) could provide solutions.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Fair compensation should be regulated within the country of origin. The concept of fair
compensation should include that in some cases a fair compensation also can be no
compensation. Compensation schemes with a legal basis should be based only on uses
where there is clear evidence that it harms the author’s economic rights, also compare
the CJEU’s decision in Case C-271/10 (VEWA/Belgium).



A.     Access to content in libraries and archives


1.     Preservation and archiving

28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
X YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
(a) The Netherlands have implemented Article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive as a narrow
preservation exception in the Dutch Copyright Act (article 16n). This exception sums up
three specific permitted acts of reproduction: restoration, preservation of works under
threat of decay, and format shifting in case software formats become inaccessible.
However, these narrowly defined acts of reproduction do not fully cover the needs of
libraries and other cultural heritage institutions in the digital environment. Firstly, they
wish to be able to digitize works for preventive purposes before they show signs of
decay, in case harm might be done to their collections (compare the Cologne archive
which collapsed into a metro tunnel). Libraries and other heritage institutions should
thus be allowed to digitize not only materials that ‘threaten to decay’, but their entire
collections to prevent any item from loss – regardless the present condition. As format
shifting is concerned, the Dutch exception in the Directive is worded too restrictively,
given that the preservation of e.g. older computer games requires not just format
shifting but also the emulation of both hardware and software.
Secondly, libraries also want to digitize works in their collections to be able to better
fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many advantages
such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and having lower storage
costs. The current Dutch implementation of article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc Directive does
not allow institutions to structurally create digital copies of works in their collection.
This prevents institutions from fully realising the potential inherent to digitisation of
their collections. This is highly detrimental in an environment where, as the 'New
Renaissance' report puts it, “digitization is more than a technical option, it is a moral
obligation”. In addition recital 40 of the Directive which states that 'Such an exception
or limitation should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected

                                                                                          8
works or other subject-matter' is highly problematic. As online communication of
works to the public becomes more and more important for cultural heritage
institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way is simply anachronistic as
it prevents institutions from using digitized works in a meaningful way.
Thirdly, technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting
cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: often CDs and DVDs are protected
by technological measures, the removal of which would require the cooperation of the
producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection measures
are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary
agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of appropriate
measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.
These measures are lacking in most Member States, to the detriment of libraries.
In order to answer even more precisely:
(a) Print and analogue materials. The digitization for preservation purposes carried out
by publicly accessible cultural institutions is implicitly included among the specific acts
of reproduction referred to in Article 5(2) (c) of the Infosoc Directive. In addition, the
EU has repeatedly recommended the adoption of national policies encouraging the
digitization of cultural heritage. However, this exception is optional and it has been
generally implemented in very narrow terms, so that, in many member states, even
format shifting for preservation purpose is still prohibited, or limited to specific formats
and/or number of copies.
(b) Digital materials fixed on support. CDs and DVDs are often protected by
technological measures (TPM). The removal of TPM would require the cooperation of
the producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides that technological protection
measures are protected per se, independently on the scope of protection, entrusting to
voluntary agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of
appropriate measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed
content. The strength of the protection of TPMs compared with the weakness of the
provision in favor of legitimate uses has led in many Member States to the absence of
effective guarantee for legitimate users, including libraries. As a result, many libraries
are not able to reproduce CDs and DVDs legally acquired. These materials will become
unusable due to technological obsolescence in a few years.
(c) Subscribed online content. In the case of online works there is no balance at all. All
the weight is on the side of the copyright holders only. Indeed the exception provided by
Art. 5 (2) (c) of Directive 2001/29 does not apply because, according to art. 6 of the
Directive, it cannot be provided any obligation to the removal of TPM to the benefit of
beneficiaries of exceptions for "works or other subject-matter made available to the
public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that members of the public may access
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them". While the exclusive
distribution right is exhausted by the first sale in EU, so that print materials can enter
permanently into the library collection, most content provided online are offered as
temporary services, ceasing upon the expiry of the subscription. In such cases, library
will have to pay again every year to ensure access to those content. In many cases, even
when licenses provide for a perpetual right of access in favor of the library and its users
((“post-termination clause”), libraries cannot obtain back-up files for conservation, but
can only have access through the producer's website, who does not give guarantees for
long-term preservation. Few licenses only, negotiated by libraries or their consortia,
provide for the delivery of files for local hosting and preservation purposes. Some others

                                                                                           9
contain a simple obligation to transfer the files in case the company will not be able to
host them.
Although a single library does not have the means to ensure the long-term digital
preservation of large amounts of resources, and the payment of an annual fee could be
justified by the fact that publishers and other commercial providers bear the costs of
storage and management of digital content on their own platforms, Recital 16 of the
Commission Recommendation of 27 October 2011, shows that the problem is that: In
spite of progress made across the EU on the preservation of digital material, in several
Member States no clear and comprehensive policies are in place on the preservation of
digital content. The absence of such policies poses a threat to the survival of digitised
material and may also result in the loss of material produced in digital format (born
digital material). The development of effective means of digital preservation has far-
reaching implications that go beyond cultural institutions. Questions of digital
preservation are relevant for any private or public organisation, which is obliged or
which wishes to preserve digital material ( (http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0039:0045:EN:PDF).
Libraries play an important role in the network of cultural heritage institutions in
charge of preserving nations’ history and archives. They play a specific role in the
literature and information sector by receiving in legal deposit, keeping and preserving,
buying, organizing, promoting and giving access to information books and literature as
a whole. Their mission is done on behalf of the general public, education and research.
Several issues are at stake now: private companies that license content do not have the
mission to defend or take into account the “public interest”, “education”, or “open
access to knowledge” in their business/licence models, so that:
-     economic sustainability of private companies that license content doesn’t offer any
      long term guarantee;
-     the evolution of format leads to a quick obsolescence that needs public
      infrastructure to act outside of economic interest to maintain national memories.
All these issues are implicitly defined missions and policy goals for many libraries, both
public and academic.

29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
An updated copyright framework is needed to ensure specific regulation for libraries
and other cultural institutions, and to secure their public mission.
Updating the copyright framework should be done in order that online content is not
considered a service. Under the current terms, the copyright framework considers
online content as a (just temporary) service. This creates a huge risk for libraries and
cultural heritage institutions, much higher than with print material, given the extreme
volatility and perishability of digital formats. It is a fact that long-term strategies such
as digital preservation and data curation are at present largely entrusted to the market
and its fluctuations which works quasi exclusively on a very short-term.
Libraries should be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to archive
complete copies of subscribed online materials, and to use the archived materials in the

                                                                                            10
event that access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An exception
should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-
term preservation, regardless of the format of publication.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
From our perspective the best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in
article 5(2) c of the InfoSoc Directive, so that it allows institutions to make reproductions
of all works in their collection as long as these are not intended for direct commercial
advantage. In line with our answer to Question 22 this exception should be made
mandatory for all Member States.
As the 'Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights
in the information society' (page 301) highlights, […]to make an exception mandatory
could apply in the case of article 5(2) c), as the development of digital libraries is one of
the key objectives of the Digital Agenda, and the digitization of cultural heritage is
promoted by the Council and the Commission […]. Instead of only allowing specific acts
of reproductions it should allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible
libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related
to their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions made as part of
mass digitization efforts, backup copies and reproductions for format shifting and
emulation. Such reproductions should be limited to use which is not for direct
commercial or economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations
allowed for by the directive (such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in
article 5(3)n that we propose in answer to question 34). Additional benefits would be
increasing the operational efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions.
Moreover, Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce
exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilizations of protected works,
regardless of format or mode of dissemination.
The result of making mandatory both Art. 5(2) c and Art. 6 of the InfoSoc Directive is
that they would support the specific public mission and responsibility of libraries and
other cultural heritage institutions, that is different from most other users of
copyrighted material. As mentioned in our answer to question 28, their main
responsibility is to preserve, organise, make available, and promote information and
literature, whose most of the content is still copyright protected. Short-term economic
interests should not limit long-term preservation of human’s cultural heritage.
Subscribed online content can escape libraries preservation schemes because of the
absence of specific exceptions, creating a huge risk of a 21st century black hole where a
large amount of content could disappear forever. Broadening the scope of the extension
along these lines mirrors the recommendations made as part of the European
Commission commissioned 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society' from December 2013.

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
[Open question]
Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers, database
vendors and right holders, impacting collection development, duration of access,
permitted uses. Libraries often entrust negotiation and management of contracts to
national or regional institutional consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the
use of consortia for the negotiations is a remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of
large numbers may introduce rigidities in pricing and business models, encouraging the
purchase or subscription of large packages of content (big deal) rather than the selection
of targeted works, a situation which is difficult to justify with all the extra public
finances spent. Currently there are gaps to be filled in the Directives (e.g. in Infosoc and
Database Directives) and even more in national copyright laws. These gaps contribute to
enforce unbalanced power relations. Unbalanced power relations among right holders,
and between right holders and users do not contribute to establish an environment of
best practices for negotiation and contracts.
To be more precise on the current unsatisfactory situation, at present, licensing
practices are not satisfactory for the following reasons:
Technical accessibility and interoperability: Format shifting and other adaptations should
be permitted not only for long-term preservation purposes, but also for remote access
when needed to ensure technical accessibility and usability by print impaired people, or
to effectively integrate acquired or licensed materials in Library information systems,
according to international standards of interoperability. But the copyright holder or the
database producer can refuse both to grant a special licence, and, in case of born-digital
content, to temporarily remove the technological protection measures in order to
facilitate the use, and often they refuse. It should be noted that TPMs protect not only
content, but also metadata related to those content, so that the legal protection of TPMs
affects also access and reuse of metadata for integration within library catalogues and
information discovery systems.
Inter-Library Loan and Document Supply: Cooperation between cultural institutions for
the benefit of the public is explicitly encouraged by numerous international, national
and regional standards. Interlibrary Loan and Document Supply are typical library
services based on the temporary exchange of documents between a library A holding the
content a library B temporarily needing the content. As an internal activity between
libraries, interlibrary exchange should be totally irrelevant for the purposes of
protection of copyright. In the digital environment, such exchange requires transmission
in a network by an intermediary (eg. an internet provider and/or a service provider).
But there is uncertainty on these points: digital reproductions made by libraries for
inter-library exchange purposes can or cannot be considered as “specific acts” of
reproduction covered by art. 5(2)c) of the InfoSoc Directive? According to the InfoSoc
Directive (Art. 5(2)c) and 5(1)), a digital reproduction made by the library "A" can or
cannot be sent electronically to the library "B", provided that copy will be used by the
library "B" for legitimate uses such as replacement of damaged parts of a volume in its
collection, or to give to an end-user a print copy within the limits of art. 5(2)b), or
communication by dedicated terminals within the (very strict) limits of art. 5(3)n), or
                                                                                         12
utilization for administrative procedures within the limits of art. 5(3)(e)? An interlibrary
electronic exchange of protected works, or parts of them, can or cannot be considered
one of those "Temporary acts of reproduction” referred to in Article 5(1), “which are
transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and
whose sole purpose is to enable: (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by
an intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and
which have no independent economic significance”, and therefore “exempted from the
reproduction right provided for in Article 2"? There are different interpretations on
this matter, and in most Member States there are no explicit exceptions for interlibrary
services. For online content subscribed by libraries, the interlibrary exchange is subject
to licences, and only few publishers allow such digital exchange.
Remote access to born-digital content: From the perspective of Dutch public libraries, the
service to make copyright protected digital works available to registered users outside of
the walls of the library (‘home-access’) has hardly developed, contrary to the situation of
university libraries and libraries connected to education and research institutes.
Publishers, licensors and distributors of e-content are generally speaking very reluctant
to conclude any contractual agreements with generally accessible libraries, museums,
and archives with an ‘open users group’. Publishers, licensors and producers refer to
the risk of profit-decrease by effects of cannibalization. In turn, public libraries refer to
the positive effect that the making available of e-content by libraries may have for
market parties, among others by raising the interest for content with quality and
through product differentiation.
Utilizations for distance learning courses and programmes: most publishers do not allow
the extraction and reuse of reasonable portions of protected works acquired or
subscribed by libraries or other cultural institutions and their communication to
registered users through e-Learning platforms. It is generally accepted that the
exception provided by Art. 5(3)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC covers both face-to-face and
distance education, and that the fundamental rights it protects (freedom of expression,
right to be informed, right to learn) are of crucial importance. The enforcement of this
exception at European level, prohibiting its restriction by national legislations, or by
licences is of utmost importance.
Open Access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on
access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member
States of policies that provide for the storage of the results of publicly funded research,
in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within
and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research
libraries are directly involved in such activities: they are often responsible of their
parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the
open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly
financed research, no later than six months after their publication. Some publishers
allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long
negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument
enforcing – on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the
public for research and non-commercial purpose, and – on the other side - the right of
libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly
available such content.
Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is huge, and
has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the
occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Libraries are
                                                                                          13
interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their
catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking text
and data mining of content to which researchers have already lawful access should be
considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is a
lack of legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content
mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than
addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time
needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data
mining of content on which researchers have lawful access, for research and non-
commercial purpose.
Post-termination access to online subscribed content: recalling our answers to Q28-30,
most licences do not provide any guarantee for access to subscribed content after the
termination of a licence. Such content is considered just as a temporary service.
Academic and research libraries have negotiated licenses for decades (even though the
above mentioned problems have been rather consistent over the years). Digital material
until now has to a large extent been focused on research and professional information
(mainly journals), reference and news, and not so much on books and mainstream
journals. Public libraries are a newcomer on this arena, due to the rapid development of
e-books for fiction and general/popular non-fiction. Access to e-material is usually
restricted to the inside of the premises of the library. Public libraries are therefore
facing the risk that their public service to society in the digital domain will not keep pace
with and meets the needs, questions and wishes of their users.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It should be permitted for a library to provide remote access to copyright works in
digital form to which it has lawful access, to a registered user, also see Question 34.
Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive needs to be
extended in order that it allows institutions to make available their digital works and
other subject matter for private use via online remote access by their registered
individual users using an authentication system.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
Especially in view of public libraries, article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive needs to be
extended in order that it is not considered as an infringement of copyright:
-      making works available for remote access for the user’s private use,
-      by publicly accessible libraries and cultural institutions which do not envisage to
achieve a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit,
-      of a digital work (e-content) which is part of the collections of these institutions,
-      to their registered, individual users,
-      via an authentication system.

In the special case of out-of-commerce works, the exception in Article 5(3)n of the
InfoSoc Directive should allow libraries, museums and archives to make digital copies of

                                                                                             14
out-of-commerce works in their collections available via open electronic networks such
as the internet for non-commercial purposes.
In general, a reform of the InfoSoc Directive should clarify that every kind of utilization
made by libraries and cultural institutions for their public-interest mission are allowed,
no matter the medium of the transmission. Remote access should be allowed for all the
utilizations discussed above (see answers to Q 32). Exceptions and limitations should
apply to online content as well as to analogue materials, and should be mandatory and
cannot be overridden by contracts or TPMs. Exceptions and limitations should be
flexible and updated to new emerging needs, introducing a general free use provision
additional to the exceptions and limitations expressly provided, as it has been suggested
with art. 16 of the IFLA Treaty Proposal (http://www.ifla.org/node/5858) and art. 5.5 of
the European Copyright Code drafted by the Wittem Group. Such a general provision
should allow application by analogy of existing exceptions and limitations, provided they
are consistent with the concept of ‘fair practice’, and/or compliant with the three-step-
test, which presently is recalled by the InfoSoc Directive just to limit the application of
exceptions and limitations. Moreover, contracts should not override any statutory
provisions regarding the entry of a work into the public domain.

3.     E – lending

36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
X YES – Please explain with specific examples
Currently, significant barriers can be observed both for public libraries and research
libraries: some publishers refuse to supply their products to libraries, or offer them at
higher prices compared to their print equivalents, or impose default selection such as
bundling, or remove content without informing the library. Moreover, multiple licences
and different use models create lack of clarity on the condition of access to content for
users. Deterioration of users’ rights is evident (e.g. crossing a border with a borrowed
book was not a problem). This is impossible with online access to a library across a
border; usually licenses will not in any case allow e-lending to other libraries or patrons
outside of the library’s defined population (e. g. municipality, university, college).
If licences terms and conditions undermine the library’s missions, and the activities
established to fulfill it, then the introduction of and transition to e-material will result in
reduced availability for library patrons.
Moreover, digital content and availability should be based on the economy of
abundance. Access to digital content offers huge potentiality to overcome physical
barriers and permits user to access to content at a time and in a place individually
chosen, without being restricted by opening hours. In this context, also, libraries remain
constraint by acquisition budgets. Each and every library cannot afford to acquire for
themselves all that is commercially available on the market. They rely on sharing
                                                                                             15
resources with other libraries in order to give good and adequate service to their
patrons.
Quoting OECD (2012), E-books: Developments and Policy Consideration,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k912zxg5svh-en, p. 8: “[…] While e-books can help increase
access to information, DRM represents a significant obstacle to lending of e-books,and
challenges the exercise of such rights by libraries which could be considered a public
interest concern in the foreseeable future. The service must not be proprietary, and be
available for different technological platforms and devices. The DRM generally
embedded in many e-books being produced today does not allow for the kind of free and
open access provided by, for example, public libraries. However, most e-editions in
scholarly libraries are free of DRM.[….] Because e-books are generally made available
for lending only to registered users at a particular library, libraries may need to
purchase multiple licences rather than sharing resources through interlibrary loans.
Costs may also be affected if territorial Digital Rights Management (DRM) restricts
libraries to purchasing geographically-specific editions of books […]”.
More generally, the question is whether it is necessary and desirable to negotiate
agreements to enable electronic lending, given that there is considerable uncertainty
about the legal status of e-lending under EU law. The EU Directive on Rental and
Lending does not explicitly exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its scope
and some libraries argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft decision by
the European Court of Justice they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for
download. In the Netherlands, the Vereniging van Openbare Bibliotheken (Netherlands
Association of Public Libraries) has brought the matter before the courts. They have
started a test case against the CMO which collects the Dutch lending right fee, arguing
that they should be allowed to lend e-books under the current Rental Directive. Their
ultimate goal is to have the Dutch court ask questions on this issue to the Court of
Justice of the EU.

  NO OPINION

37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
We would recommend to follow the EBLIDA principles on the acquisition and access to
e-books by libraries, highlighting among others the following needs:
-     All e-book titles and other intangible media, which have legally been made
      available in whichever form, should be available to libraries for acquisition and
      access and making available to the public;
-     All e-books titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;
-     Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats, or cooperate with
      libraries in making interoperable formats;
-     Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books for a
      limited period of time to a user.
-     It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;
-       Authorised users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by
way of remote access via authentication systems. (An authorized user is a user who has
registered with the library and whose identity is known to the library.

Public lending right (PLR) and e-lending
An adaptation of the PLR under the form of a Legal Licence (including a mandatory
exception whenever necessary) could be a path to follow to ensure a fair remuneration to
authors.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
There is no possible comparison between physical and online collection in libraries.
Currently, libraries can buy all physical publications, when they cannot buy licences to
all commercially available digital content because “the rights holders are free to decide
whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such
access. The consequence of this is that the collection building policy may be decided by
the publisher and not by the library “ (see EBLIDA. European Libraries and the
challenges of e-publishing. May 2012, www.eblida.org/news/european-libraries-and-the-
challenges-of-e-publishing.html). In the long run this development threatens to
undermine the core function of libraries to preserve the knowledge and culture of our
societies and to keep it available to the public.
Libraries should have a “right to e-lend”, which will give the library users a “right to e-
read”.
The 'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in
the information society' that was commissioned by the European Commission and
published in December 2013 contains an interesting observation. At the end of the
section discussing inter alia the exception benefitting cultural heritage institutions, the
authors observe that:
"The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to apply at
distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online transmission of digital
items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc
Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to look at different uses that
some categories of users (libraries or educational institutions) or some objectives (access
to culture and knowledge or education) would be privileged to undertake under a
limitation of copyright. [...] the space of non-infringing uses could be defined by their
objective and some general conditions, including a more open requirement that the use
does not exceed what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this study
has not made. It could make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and
understandable for users and copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each
exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of protection
of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted."

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and


                                                                                             17

4.     Mass digitisation


40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following)
are too limited. The issue of mass digitization is far broader than what can be addressed
with the 2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan Works Directive (the other relevant European
policy instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitization of
collections and the subsequent making available of digitized works require a
comprehensive approach that cannot be based the principles of due diligence search and
licensing. If we want to enable European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their
collections into the digital age (and there cannot be any doubt that this is both an
important policy objective and a reasonable expectation of users who as taxpayers fund
these organisations) we need a far more comprehensive approach.
Both the 2012 Orphan Works Directive and the 2011 MoU on Out of Commerce Works
are insufficient to address the copyright issues arising from mass digitisation projects.
The Orphan Works Directive is ill-suited to enable mass digitisation projects. While it
will enable publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives to make orphan works
available after a due diligence search has been carried out for specific works, the
requirement of carrying out due diligence search makes it effectively unusable for mass
digitisation projects as this would require an huge additional investments in both time
and money.
The MoU on Out of Commerce Works could have offered solutions but, in addition to
the fact that national laws fail to fully address the needs of digital libraries, the MoU is
severely limited by its lack of implementation and concrete application across Europe,
so that e.g. cross-border effect is not legally enabled. It is most probable that the
question of cross-border access will be better solved by introducing an exception for
libraries, museums and archives to make available content resulting of mass digitisation
projects by an extension of Articles 5(2)c and 5(3)n of the InfoSoc Directive.
Alternatively, solutions such as Extended Collective Licensing exist that could well be
useful, as stated in the report available at:
www.ivir.nl/publicaties/guibault/ECL_Europeana_final_report092011.pdf. In the
Netherlands, cultural heritage institutions (including our library) together with Dutch
CMOs have asked the government to investigate the possibility of introducing a Dutch
legal basis for Extended Collective Licensing
(www.fobid.nl/sites/fobid/files/130910ECL_briefZonderHandtek_def.pdf).

                                                                                            18

  NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
X YES – Please explain
The mechanism should be based on an exception allowing for mass digitization of out-of-
commerce works. The mechanism should regulate right clearance in line with the
guidelines provided for in the Out of Commerce MoU guidelines. Moreover, The public
has a legitimate interest in having online access to the collections of all publicly
accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe (see article 27.1 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no good reason for limiting
mechanisms that create such access to certain types of content. The approach proposed
in reaction to questions 40 and 34 above, would cover all types of works and other
subject matter that are held by these institutions. This solution would also be in line with
the relevant recommendation made in the 'New Renaissance' report of the Commission
appointed 'Comite de Sages' that was published in 2011. The report recommended that
'solutions for orphan works and out of distribution works must cover all the different
sectors: audiovisual, text, visual arts, sound'.

D.     Disabilities

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
X YES – Please explain by giving examples
(ad b) Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of
people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for
rather different implementations at Member States level. Within the ETIN initiative,
facilitated by the copyright of DG Market, and in good collaboration with FEP , IFRRO
and the EWC , the consequences of these different national implementations of the so-
called disability exception are directly felt. For cross-border sharing of adapted
materials published under this exception the most progress can be made when we start

                                                                                             19
sharing within common languages. German is a common language for more than 3
countries, so is French, and Dutch is shared between the Netherlands and Flanders.
There are specific copyright issues that are making the cross border sharing under
ETIN conditions difficult, and right holders are hesitant to sign the ETIN cross-border
licence/agreement for precisely these reasons. The most striking example of the
difference in the scope of what is lawfully defined as being print disabled can be found in
the German situation. Under German copyright law the disability exception is restricted
to those who cannot read print for sensory reasons, and this excludes circulation of these
copies among persons with dyslexia. In Austria this is not the case, meaning that a copy
made under the German disability exception could legally be distributed among a wider
group of beneficiaries in Austria than in Germany itself. Rights holders claim that this
cannot be done, because such use was never included when permission was granted to
produce the adapted copy. Also German Trusted Intermediaries (TI’s) cannot and will
not carry the responsibility for the use of the adapted copies they export to other TI’s in
different Member States, nor make a distinction how to distribute the adapted copies
they have imported. To quote Elke Dittmer, director of Medibus (the German
distributor of all adapted copies made in Germany):
“Within ETIN it means that all accessible books made in Germany are only for blind and
visually impaired users in other countries. Those libraries (abroad) who are serving also
other print disabled user can’t distribute our books to them. That means that they have to
classify the book which can be lend out to which category of disabled persons. And I have
no idea how to communicate this to a dyslexic person in Denmark that accessible books
from Netherlands are for him but not the German ones. If we would join ETIN our
colleagues in other countries will face problems with different groups of disabled people
and maybe this is also a legal problem because it could be a discrimination to some
people.” [Elke Dittmer in an email to Katja Mutsaers of DG Market, 17th of June 2012]
Between the Netherlands and Flanders there are also barriers that need to be solved
before a full sharing of the collections made in the Netherlands and those in Flanders
can start to flow optimally. The differences here are not on the level of the copyright
exception in the copyright laws, but in the voluntary arrangements that the Dutch TI
and the Flanders TI have with their respective publishers organizations, for instance
whether online distribution of adapted copies can be done or how the lending of these
copies through public libraries is remunerated per lending. So not only differences in
national copyright laws, but all differences in implementing and servicing the
beneficiaries in the various Member States need to be overcome.


On a national level
On the whole one could say that the Dutch copyright law and its “handicap-exception”
provides a good basis for facilitating and implementing a service to the print disabled in
the Netherlands. For decades workable solutions have been found in voluntary collective
agreements with the rights holders and services have been implemented through a
special budget for Adapted reading that is under the control of the Netherlands Institute
for Public Libraries (Sectorinstituut Openbare Bibliotheken). Of course that budget is
not enough. It allows not even for less than 10% of all that is published in the
Netherlands. No wonder we like to be able to import more text books, especially from
the US and the UK to supply to print disabled students at high schools and universities.
Many of these schools teach courses in English and the adapted version are available in
mainly in the US, but are not allowed to leave the country. TIGAR is the beginning of a

                                                                                          20
solution, but is (much too) slow and title by title clearance is necessary. In many cases
the more recent books cannot be cleared. ETIN is no solution for the US books for
obvious reasons. The WIPO Marrakesh Treaty gives a hopeful perspective, but it could
take years before important exporting countries like the US and UK will ratify it.
The handicap exception clause in the Dutch copyright law is like many other limitations
subject to the three-step-test of the Bern Convention. Meaning that a right holder may
resist the making of a adapted copy if there is an accessible copy on the commercial
market. At the moment that is very seldom the case. With the emergence of eBooks that
might change rapidly. Can the right holders resist making an accessible version under
the handicap exception when they have published an eBook that could in theory and
with a lot of technical dexterity be read through synthetic speech output? That will
indeed be big setback for the beneficiaries of accessible copies, because the eBook and its
ecosystem of ordering, downloading and reading is not nearly as accessible as the Daisy
Audio book services that the TI’s provide.


(ad a) A primary fundamental problem regarding inclusion is that a person with a
disability can only borrow, not buy adapted materials.
An example of European cross-border obstacles: A Flemish person with a disability
wishing to read a Spanish book, addressing him/herself to the library for people with a
handicap in Spain, called ONCE, cannot get this book, neither by becoming member of
this Spanish library, nor by ordering it through the Flemish Adapted Reading Library
Luisterpunt. The situation is the same in case one is interested in reading English or
German titles.

51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
For all target groups of people with a disability in Europe it is of utmost importance that
the International WIPO Treaty (Marrakesh 2013) is rapidly signed and ratified both by
the European Union, as well as by all individual Member States. The effect will be that
the adaption in a readable format becomes a right; that distribution of books in adapted
reading formats to all types of user groups becomes possible; that cross-border lending
goes without problems; that both online distribution and distribution on a carrier
(Daisy-cd, Braille-print) are service-possibilities. Close cooperation with the adapted
reading user-organisations involved like in the Netherlands, the library sector with the
Oogvereniging, can make clear why swift EU-wide ratification of the WIPO Treaty is
necessary.
On cross border sharing: we need a unified/harmonized definition on what is meant to
be print disabled, based on the human rights as explained in the UN Convention on the
rights of persons. The Marrakesh Treaty points the way forward, but implementation
may take a too long time. We need intermediary solutions that can create a better flow
of adapted accessible copies across borders. The difference between ETIN and TIGAR
should be overcome – through an extension of the ETIN MoU? and both should work
along the same legal frameworks.

                                                                                        21
On definition of print disabled: we cannot discriminate between types of handicap.
On the definition of accessibility: we need to make the definition of accessibility against
the benchmark of normal reading: that means: an accessible version can be searched
for, found and read in a way that is equitable to what sighted people can. This is
sometimes referred to as the ecosystem of reading. The availability of a simple
(unstructured audio, not synchronized), is not enough to justify the label “accessible” .
Sighted people can flip through their book, browse website, order books, use eReaders,
search in eBooks etc. All these functions should become or stay available to the print
disabled readers too.


52.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
        How successful are they?
[Open question]
As explained in Question 50: In the Netherlands good cooperation exists between the
producers of accessible copies (Dedicon) and the publishers through their national
association NUV. NUV recommends the cooperation between publishers and Dedicon
and in many cases this leads to efficient production. However, re-selling the adapted
copy back to original owner/publisher hardly ever happens. In the future this might be a
workable model however. That all depends if and to what extent the file formats for
eBooks and those for accessible versions such as Daisy will be truly integrated and
embraced by the marketplace. For the time being the two are not integrated. Dedicon
could however upgrade/convert the publisher’s digital file, not only to make the needed
Braille version, but to enrich the eBook with certain navigation markers, or media
overlays to make it more attractive for the publisher to put on the market. The
collaboration between the Daisy Consortium and the International Digital Publishing
Forum (IDPF) on the ePub3 standard is an excellent facilitator for that.
At the European level: It has become clear that a more equitable situation all over
Europe is necessary. Standards are necessary to develop sustainable solutions for
adapted reading formats. ETIN exists already two years but didn’t realise concrete
results for the target groups. The ETIN-project for cross-border lending of accessible
materials for print disabled persons is important, but can only be successful if the EU
supports it by project money and give support to a first step in the project in which
cross-border lending between countries with the same language becomes possible.




VI.       A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
X YES
In line with our previous answers (see questions 21 and 22) any tool that would provide
more coherence into the EU copyright system would be very welcome. A single EU

                                                                                          22

and enable cross-border effect. See the Wittem Group’s European Copyright Code,

VII.      Other issues

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
Copyright law reform at the European level is absolutely necessary to simplify the
current complicated regime and the overlapping of different directives. Licensing
initiatives alone will not achieve this.
Meanwhile, the EU should develop mechanisms to ensure that licence clauses cannot
override exceptions and limitations. During the previous Licences for Europe dialogue,
it has never been made possible to discuss this issue, hence the need of urgent decision
on that point. For the same reason, the removal of technological protection measures
should be made compulsory for all legitimate uses.
Licenses for libraries
The exclusive rights that exist in regards to published works should not include the right
of refusal to sell to libraries, or to limit their services, both in physical and digital
environment. Commercial licences for libraries should include and not override the
utilizations presently permitted by the InfoSoc and Database Directives. In all cases, the
use of the acquired materials should be allowed for the following purposes:
a.      Research. The Library, its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates together with
its Authorized Users should, from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, be
able to search, retrieve, and display the licensed materials, print or download and save
individual chapters, articles or items of the licensed materials without legal or
technological impediment. Moreover, they should be able to use data and text mining
technologies to derive information from the licensed materials for computational
analysis and other research purposes.
b.     Education and Teaching. The Library and its Authorized Users should be able to
extract or use information contained in licensed materials for educational, scientific, or
research purposes, including extraction and manipulation of information or images for
the purpose of illustration, explanation, comment, criticism, teaching, research, or
analysis. The Library and/or its parent Institution’s staff and affiliates should be able to
use a reasonable portion of licensed materials in the course of instruction and
communicate same material to Authorized Users at a place and time convenient to them.
c.     Scholarly Sharing. Authorized Users should be able to transmit to a third party
colleague in hard copy or electronically, insubstantial amounts of the licensed materials
for personal, scholarly, educational, scientific, or research uses. Authorized Users should
be able to use, with appropriate credit, figures, tables and brief excerpts from the

                                                                                             23
Licensed Materials in the Authorized User’s own scientific, scholarly and educational
works. When an Authorized User is the Author of an article which is part of the licensed
materials, and which is the result of a publicly funded research, he/she or the Library
staff should be able to put such work, with appropriate credit to the Publisher, in an
Open Access repository after a reasonable time from the date of its publication.
d.      Interlibrary Loan. Licensee’s staff should be able to provide to other libraries or
cultural institutions whether by post or fax, or secure electronic transmission, whereby
the electronic file is deleted immediately after printing, for the purposes of research or
private study and not for Commercial Use, a single copy of articles, chapters, or other
individual documents from licensed materials.
e.      Technical Accessibility, usability and interoperability. Format shifting and other
adaptations should be permitted for long-term preservation purposes, or to ensure
technical accessibility and usability by visually impaired Authorized users, or to
effectively integrate Licensed Materials in Library information systems, according to
international standards of interoperability. Within the limits of these purposes, the
Licensor should agree to temporarily remove the technical barriers that may prevent
adaptations.
f.      Administrative and Judicial Proceedings. The Library, its parent Institution’s
staff, affiliates and authorized users should be able to transmit and/or upload individual
articles to secure electronic systems for judicial and administrative use, including any
national research quality assessment (such as RAE in UK or VQR in Italy) and the
selection procedures for academic and professional careers.
g.      Archival Availability. The Library should be granted a nonexclusive, royalty-
free, perpetual right to use any licensed materials accessed during the License term. The
Licensor should permit the Library to archive one complete copy of the Licensed
Materials, and permit use of the archived materials in the event that access is
discontinued or suspended. Such use should be in accordance with the provisions of the
agreement, which provisions shall survive any termination of it, provided that the
contractual terms of the License agreement will not override any statutory provisions
regarding the entry of the work into the public domain. This means that the archival
copy should be free after the termination of copyright terms, when it enters in the public
domain. It should be prevented the revival of exclusive "sui generis" rights.. Once a
work is out-of-commerce in its all versions, Libraries should be entitled to give
unrestricted access to licensed materials.
We would like to quote some excerpts of the report of P.B. Hugenholtz & M.R.F.
Senftleben (2011, November). Fair Use in Europe. In Search of Flexibilities. IViR.
Amsterdam, Netherlands. Available at,

-       Page 10: “The current lack of flexibility in copyright law undermines the very
fundamental freedoms, societal interests and economic goals that copyright law
traditionally aims to protect and advance. This is the case particularly in the area of
limitations and exceptions – an area where more than elsewhere in the law of copyright
rules have become detailed, rigid and connected to specific states of technology.
Examples abound. Whereas social media have in recent times become an essential
means of social and cultural communication, current copyright law leaves little or no
room for sharing ‘user-generated content’ that builds upon pre-existing works. By the
same token, current limitations and exceptions rarely take into consideration current
educational and scholarly practices, such as the use of copyright protected content in
                                                                                         24
Powerpoint presentations, in ‘digital classrooms’, on university websites or in scholarly
e-mail correspondence. Existing limitations and exceptions in many Member States’
copyright laws also find it hard to accommodate such essential information tools as
search engines. By impeding these and other uses that should arguably remain outside
the reach of copyright protection, the law’s overly rigorous structure impedes not only
cultural, social and economic progress, but also undermines the social legitimacy of
copyright law proper.”
-       Page 17: “The EU acquis, in other words, contains flexibilities that may be
invisible at the national level because of an overly cautious and restrictive
implementation.”
-       Page 29: “There appear to be good reasons and ample opportunity to
(re)introduce a measure of flexibility in the national copyright systems of Europe. The
need for having more openness in copyright law is almost self-evident in this
‘information society’ of highly dynamic and unpredictable change. A historic
perspective also suggests that, due to a variety of circumstances, copyright law,
particularly in the civil law jurisdictions of Europe, has lost much of its flexibility in the
course of the past century. In other words, making copyright law in author’s rights
regimes more flexible would not go against the grain of legal tradition. (…) We would
therefore recommend to introduce a measure of flexibility alongside the existing
structure of well-defined limitations and exceptions, and thus combine the
advantages of legal security and technological neutrality.”
To conclude, we would like to ensure that any Copyright review will not lead to EU
legislation which is less progressive than the current regime. A comparative study of the
current 28 copyright regimes identifying the most up-to-date and progressive solutions
developed in Member States could be a good work in parallel to this consultation.
Identifying where citizens and public institutions’ rights benefit the most would open up
new legislative opportunities and would support the need of social harmonisation.
