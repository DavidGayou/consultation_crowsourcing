Response to Public
Consultation on the review of
the EU copyright rules

Introduction
The University of Kent is one of the UK’s leading academic institutions with a commitment to
excellence in teaching and research that has spanned five decades.

Known as the UK’s European university, it was granted its Royal Charter in 1965 and now has over
19,000 undergraduate students studying at its campuses in Canterbury and Medway. The University
has a thriving postgraduate community with approximately 3,000 students registered on taught and
research programmes at Canterbury and Medway, as well as our specialist European centres in
Brussels, Paris, Athens and Rome.

The University welcomes this opportunity to comment on the review of the EU copyright rules,
especially given its position as the UK’s European University.


Commentary on the review of EU copyright rules

The University of Kent would like to endorse the response to the consultation submitted by the
Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance (LACA). This response summarises the key issues that
educational establishments, researchers and members/users of cultural and scientific institutions face
under the current copyright acquis.

In summary we would like to raise the following:

   Access to copyright material for education and research is not optimised within the EU, with
    significant barriers to cross-border learning and research.

   There should be minimum mandatory copyright exceptions across the EU to enable use of
    material for teaching, learning, preservation and research without sole reliance on licensing
    solutions.

   Contracts should not be able to override these minimum mandatory exceptions and nor should
    Technical Protection Measures (TPMs).

   Access to broadcast material is particularly difficult as UK universities must limit digital access to
    material licensed through the ERA and Box of Broadcasts to those located in the UK only. This
    has presented significant barriers to development of courses at the University of Kent’s European
    centres.

   As stated by the UK IPO, hyperlinks should not be subject to copyright protection as they are
    effectively signposts to content, not the content itself.

   Viewing of web pages on screen should be covered by the existing copyright exception covering
    making of temporary copies.

   A central, voluntary registration system for works across the EU could help with identification and
    licensing of copyright material.

   The current copyright term of 70 years following the death of the author creates problems with
    use of older material in libraries and archives. Copyright duration should be reduced to life + 50
    years with an option to register an additional 20 years if the work is being commercially exploited.

   It would be useful to consider a system of US-style ‘fair use’ across the EU and undertake further
    research in this area.

   Library patrons should be able to get off-site access to legitimately acquired digital content.

   More robust provisions are needed to support mass digitisation across the EU.

   The EU should consider mandating that all public and charity funded research is made Open
    Access on publication.

   The EU should sign up to and ratify the Marrakech Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works
    by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities.

   Text and data mining for commercial and non-commercial purposes should be covered by an
    exception throughout Europe. This would remove a major barrier to adoption of innovative
    research techniques within education and research institutions.

   Educational institutions should not be regarded as intermediaries in cases of copyright
    infringements by users of their networks.

   It is not appropriate to adopt a single EU copyright title at this stage and further evidence would
    be required to consider whether this would be beneficial or feasible.


The University should be regarded as an institutional user for the purposes of the consultation
response.
