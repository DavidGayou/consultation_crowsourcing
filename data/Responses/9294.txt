     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:


Name:
BAPLA (The British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies – www.bapla.org.uk).
BAPLA is the UK trade association for picture libraries and agencies representing
photographers and copyright owners of images across all genres - from archive to
contemporary images; from live news reporting to conceptual art-directed creative images.
The majority of our members are commercial companies, operating on a B2B basis within a
highly competitive global market economy. Digital production, digital delivery and online
contracting are the norm.
The photo licensing industry is worth several billion dollars globally and in the UK alone
several hundred million pounds, with BAPLA members contributing a sizeable amount
towards this. Our members employ in the region of 2,500 people in the UK and generate
revenue for, and manage the interests of, over 120,000 creators and rights holders. The
photographic sector has undergone rapid change over the last 10 to 20 years, largely due to
the advancement of digital technology and equipment, resulting in exponential rises in the
volume of quality digital images entering the marketplace.
BAPLA and many of its members take a progressive approach, embracing technology to help
service the needs of new digital business models. Picture agencies and libraries these days
operate efficient and transparent, often automated, systems that issue licenses, collect and
distribute payments to rights holders and monitor usages for mandated works/rights. They
invest in the digitizing of analogue images as well as in the creation of digital new images, in
both cases undertaking or overseeing the cataloguing, adding metadata to and marketing of
the images.
Preliminary Comments
Copyright is the economic foundation of European creativity. In our opinion, EU copyright
legislation has been robust enough to allow adaptability in the market whilst protecting
rightsholders such as authors and creators, and enabled each EU country to adapt the law to
suit the needs of it's citizens. From the commercial aspect, our members have always
provided flexible business models adapted to the needs of their customers whilst maximising
remuneration for the rightsholders they represent. The symbiosis of the relationship between
rightsholders and their representatives provides the opportunity for the rightsholder to earn a
sustainable income from their creativity, while the representative invests heavily in sending
the content to market and promoting the material.
Territoriality
For many of our members, a licensee has the opportunity to shop around to find the right
content to suit their budgets including ‘Multi-Territorial Licences'. The act of ‘making
available’ material, in the context of multi-territories, is still the right to reproduce with the
‘making available’ right being of secondary importance. Clarification of the territorial scope
of the making available right may have a negative impact on enforcement of rights.
Linking and Resale Rights
The issue of hyperlinking is intrinsically tied to whether there is a commercial gain associated
with such use, whether direct or indirect, challenging the ability of the rights holder to exert
their rights and in turn generate an income. Viewing a web page does not need further
copyright legislation, however there must be a distinction made about the context of
                                                                                                     5
hyperlink placements which needs further questioning. Whereas 'download to own digital
content' is a market-led solution to demand, it should not be jeopardised by resale rights,
which are incompatible with the nature of transactions involving digital content. More
emphasis should be placed on understanding the differences between personal and
commercial use as well as the issues surrounding resale rights.
Registration of Works
With regards to registration, we feel strongly that it is not in the interests of those in our
sector, as in European law copyright is automatic as opposed to the US where copyright for
works has to be registered in order to claim statutory damages on infringements. Registration
is not a practical solution for photography where millions of pictures are created every day. It
is unworkable for many in our industry especially where image identifying software
programmes have provided solutions. The adoption of identifiers, whether text or image-
based, are already being explored (and in some cases currently in use) within our industry for
commercially available images. However it is those images created by the public (original
UGC), which are currently exploited by Internet technology companies, who are unaware of
the solutions available. For our industry, the promotion of metadata standards for the images
industry and strengthening of the protections against metadata stripping to include automated
stripping is of paramount importance.
Term of Protection & Exceptions
As for whether the term of copyright protection is appropriate, changing terms can have a
profound affect for any rights holder who has built enterprise/s based on current copyright
terms, costing sole traders, SME's and larger companies, the financial investment into their
businesses. This also applies to broadening the scope of copyright exceptions, which can have
a substantial effect for rights holders with little or no recourse to generate an income. It is an
area still fiercely debated. BAPLA has, at length, submitted its concerns regarding the
expansion of the UK copyright exceptions.
Respect for Rights
Much of the debate focuses on short term free access and dissemination of content with little
thought given to those that create it, as well as those that invest in it. For the longer-term
implications for future content generation, we firmly believe that there should be fair
remuneration for all rightsholders based on the market value and that there must continue to
be a healthy commercial market within which EU copyright law remains to protect creators.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  9
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
         - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]

   For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing
a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                    10
Our members grant multi-territory licences on a regular basis (daily, if not hourly collectively
speaking). Multi-territory licensing forms part of our business and are a well established way
in which right holders approve global online uses of their works. Indeed, the granting of
global rights is the default position for all licenses issued under a “royalty-free” license
model, an increasingly popular license model operated by many of our members. Even under
the more traditional “rights-managed” license model, both multi-territory and global licenses
are commonly available for most types of uses, including online uses.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
In some instances a multi-territorial license is inappropriate as restrictions are necessary
in order to protect all stakeholders – author, agent and client. Whilst restrictions are
managed by the agent, they maybe imposed by the author for various reasons having
regard to the work in question.
For example, an author may have previously granted exclusive rights to a third party to
use a work within a certain territory or may wish to exploit a work directly themselves
(instead of via an agency) in their “home territory”, in each case meaning that rights are
unavailable in said territories to other would-be licensees. The Presumption of
Innocence Rights, which in France prohibits the distribution of images of person under
arrest, is an example how an image may be unable to be published in France but okay
elsewhere due to differing local laws. In addition, other rights relating to the subject
matter featured within an image maybe enforceable in one country but not in another.
This could apply to the personality rights of a person featured or to items protected by
other forms of intellectual property such as a registered trademark or a copyright
protected design.




6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
                                                                                             11
         – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
         – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Multi-territory licensing works well for our members and is flexible enough to provide
sufficient protection to right holders on the one hand (enabling them to decide freely on
the exploitation of their national rights), and on the other hand enabling the industry to
adapt swiftly to the changes brought about by the digital distribution and global access
to content.      Furthermore, unlike music, there is limited appeal and history of
photography being managed under collective arrangements. Any move to applying a
collective approach to administering multi-territory licenses of the online
communication to the public or making available rights in connection to images should
be strongly avoided. We prefer the market led approach, regulatory intervention is not
needed.



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


       – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level

                                                                                                               13

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
         – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


The commercial reality for our members is that the licence to use an image granted by
them includes (even if not expressly listed) all rights necessary for the use of the image.
In this context, the key right is the right to reproduce, with the “making available” right
being of secondary importance. The license fee is calculated based on usages proposed,
not the type of underlying rights granted.
Clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right may have impact on
enforcement of rights but in this context too the reproduction right is one that is
predominantly enforced.


2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              14
An additional right is an option that, even if not used, does not harm our members’
interest. As explained in the answers to Q.9, the licences granted by our members grant
all the necessary rights to use the licensed content so multiple rights to the same content
are not an issue. Plus, whilst enforcement efforts of our members generally focus on
policing unlawful reproduction, more rights are always an advantage. Similarly, from
the perspective of a licensee, the existence of the two rights (reproduction and “making
available”) in respect of a single digital transmission does not bring with it any added
complexities. Rights can be licensed using electronic systems of rights identification and
rights management without the user even needing to be aware.


3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Yes, hyperlinking should be subject to authorisation of the right-holder but only in very
specific circumstances. Those specific circumstances are where the hyperlinking makes
images available on a commercial basis in a way that deters a viewer from accessing the
rights-holder’s website. This interpretation stems from the reach of the making
available right.
To be clear, it is not the act of linking that should be subject to authorisation, it is the
framing, or “in-linking”, of the link that should be, and only then when the framing is
performed in such a way so as to provide a viable alternative to visiting the rights-
holder’s website. We are not opposed to hyperlinking per se.
It is a question of fact and degree, context is key. Factors that should be taken into
account in determining whether “in-linking” requires authorisation include the amount
of the copyright work that is viewable before the hyperlink is clicked and the proportion
of the screen it takes up. The greater the amount of the work and the greater the
proportion of the screen, the stronger the case that authorisation should be required, as
these can both erode the incentive for a viewer to access the link in order to view the
original source of the work.

                                                                                                         15
This is important because the owner of the website containing the hyperlinks may
generate advertising revenue, directly or indirectly by keeping the viewer on its website
for a longer period of time than it otherwise might. This is at the expense of the rights-
holder, whose opportunity to generate revenue from the same viewer is thereby deprived
or greatly eroded. Examples of this practice are the image search services offered by
numerous search engines, whereby whole images are often used as, or alongside
hyperlinks. In these cases, the link is the image.
The fact that an image may not technically be “reproduced” on the hyperlinking website
provides no comfort to a rights-holder. On the contrary, somebody viewing an “in-
linked” hyperlink containing an image still places demands on the bandwidth of the
right-holder’s servers hosting the image even if the hyperlink is not clicked. In this way,
the rights-holder bears all the costs but takes no benefit. Copyright protection should
not be dependent on the technique used to communicate a work but on the fact that it is
communicated.
Not only do these practices take away opportunities for rights-holders to generate their
own revenue from such page views, they encourage and perpetuate downstream
copyright infringement. This is because users of such image search services may not
appreciate the need to obtain a licence to reproduce the image on their own website. Our
members find this is a common cause for confusion and is the number one excuse
encountered when seeking to enforce online use of images. That is, third parties
unwittingly believe that they are free to re-use images found in image search results
simply because the image search service is itself free to use. The ease with which images
may be copied by right-clicking together with inadequate notices applied by search
engine websites warning that the images are owned by third parties, only serves to
exacerbate the problem.
The above considerations all become amplified in the mobile environment where screen
space is at greater premium.
To clarify, we are not saying that the temporary caching of the hyperlink on a viewer’s
computer should be an infringement, only that the act of making available the hyperlink
in the “in-linking” manner described above, should be.
Unfortunately, the solution to in-line hyperlinking of images is not as simple as
providing rights-holders with a way of opting-out of having their images linked to.
Considering the dominance of certain search engines, this would be akin to opting-out of
the Internet completely. Few rights-holders would be willing to take this step, as this
would then make it far more difficult for them to find prospective licensees. Plus, if opt-
outs were enacted en-masse, this would effectively foreclose competition in the market
for viewing images online. What is needed is a legal regime that recognises that certain
forms of hyperlinking do require the permission of the right-holder, at least to the extent
that it enables the right-holder to participate to a fair degree in the profits generated by
the third party creating the hyperlink.
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
      – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Viewing of images, involving the temporary copying of an image, should not be the
subject of a licence. Temporary copying in this case is a result of the technological
process without which the act of viewing content online would not be possible. Copyright
should not and currently does not prevent simply looking at things. That said, there
seems to be a lacuna in protection for right-holders when it comes to P2P caching.
Perhaps 90% of the content on P2P systems consists of copyright protected works
(movies, music, images, etc.), much of which is distributed without the right-holder’s
permission. With no recourse against viewers/users and ISP’s being able to take the
benefit of safe harbours provided under the E-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC), this
can leave right-holders helpless if the provider of the P2P website/technology is
unidentifiable or otherwise out of legal reach. Whilst this is not currently a major
problem for BAPLA members – P2P systems are more commonly used for sharing
movies and music than they are for images – we have sympathy for impacted
rightsholders and would advocate a legislative solution not focused on the user/viewer
but rather upon a re-examination of the safe harbours under the InfoSoc Directive, the
objective being to place a greater level of responsibility on ISP’s to be vigilant and pro-
active in guarding against such practices.
(BAPLA signed an amicus brief on the Perfect 10 case that illustrates issue of caching in
relation to images very well.)27




4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further

distribution of that tangible article)28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
         – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Resale rights for digital images would create a secondary market in goods, which are not sold
in the first instance – the use of images is merely licensed. The consequences of providing a
legal framework where it is not required would severely affect the businesses of BAPLA’s
members; businesses built on an initial investment of digitizing analogue images, as well as
on the continuing investment in creating new images and in both cases also involving the
cataloguing, metadata and identifier input and marketing of images. A secondary market in
digital images would deprive our members of the opportunity to recoup this investment.
Resale rights are incompatible with the nature of transactions involving digital images. A
hallmark of all of our members’ standard form licence agreements is that they are always non-
sub-licensable. This is distinct from the rights granted to use or exploit an end user product or
service incorporating an image, for which a product or service may be freely traded within the
express parameters of a negotiated licence. The essence of digital content is that is can be
seen, or experienced, by an unlimited number of users whist still being owned and controlled
by the rightsholder. Consequently, the rightsholder does not need to sell it, and can merely
license it. Control over the use of the digital content is the key rightly held by its right owner.
The introduction of a right of resale (or relicense) of previously licensed images would have a
hugely constraining and possibly devastating effect on picture libraries and the rights holders

28
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
29
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the rightsholder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18
they represent, as well as the distribution of licensed images. It would result in any purchaser
of an image licence effectively becoming a potential competitor to the rights-holder. It would
be virtually impossible to police the “delete” element of the “forward and delete” concept and
it would deter rights-holders from offering discounts for bulk purchases of licenses.
Reuse of images MUST take place with the agreements of rights holders, otherwise there
would likely be a drastic decline in the investment, production and therefore overall output of
professionally shot images in the future.
Plus, any doctrine of exhaustion at the EU level, would leave re-users vulnerable to being
sued in non-EU jurisdictions that do not have a similar doctrine should they use the content on
the Internet, thereby making it available in other jurisdictions.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered31.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?



Copyright is an automatic right in the European Union, which is benefit to all EU
creators. Put simply, it is hard to understand how any organisation could manage a
registration system for images. According to some sources32, 880 billion photos will be
taken in 2014 from an estimated 7.3 billion camera phones33 on the planet.


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
We do not see there would be any net advantages that could be realistically achieved.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


30
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

A registration system would create a two-tier system for copyright protection, i.e. better
visibility and protection for registered content and a lack of (or inferior) protection of
unregistered content. This would not be in compliance with the philosophy and law of
international copyright treaties to which EU countries are signatories.
Whilst in theory a registration system could bring benefits in terms of helping to identify the
rights-holder of an otherwise potentially orphan work, the disadvantages of a formal
registration system at the EU level would vastly outweigh the benefits. The disadvantages
would include the additional burden on rights-holders of making a registration for each
copyright work produced, which would set-back the EU compared to other jurisdictions
where registration is not compulsory. Also, it could lead to a false preconception that if a
work is not registered, it is not protected or likely to be enforced, therefore putting rights-
holders on the back foot and users vulnerable to legal exposure. Plus, the costs of establishing
and maintaining a register would be a deadweight loss in terms of economic efficiency. All of
these factors would be exacerbated as the sheer volume of newly created digital works grows
exponentially on a regular basis, digital images being a case in point (see comments in Q.15
above).
For any registration system to provide a net benefit we feel it would need to be:
(1)     Voluntary and non-exclusive (so a rights-holder would not be prevented from
registering the same copyright work elsewhere and the registry would not confer monopoly
rights on the entity running it which would then need to be regulated);
(2)     Free to register;
(3)     For images, include a visual reverse-search mechanism so it is easy to search; and
(4)    Be free to query (at least for the purpose of identifying works as part of an orphans
works diligent search).
Rather than an EU level registration system, we feel what would be of benefit and an easier
solution to implement, would be a non-exhaustive, authoritative directory of existing publicly
accessible databases of different types of copyright work that are available globally. It is
important that any such reference tool has global coverage in view of the global nature of the
Internet. If successful, it could make the EU the first destination point for business globally
wishing to find and license copyright works.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed34, and identify, variously, the work
34
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       20
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database35 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition36 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub37 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
We would like to see the EU take a proactive approach in the promotion of open and cross-
sector identifiers for all types of digital content, as well as the strengthening of the protections
against metadata stripping. This should include building upon established identifiers and
metadata standards, such as IPTC for images. We expect that such initiatives would bring far
greater value to society in the form of easier, faster and more frictionless copyright licensing
compared to spending resources in establishing a registration system that could never be all-
inclusive and would bring with it the disadvantages we describe in Q.17.
Promotion by the EU authorities could take the form of EU institutions themselves being
early adopters of new identifier standards and by continuing to fund R&D projects such as the
one currently being undertaken under the Rights Data Integration banner (which is piloting
the work of the Linked Content Coalition). It could also include introducing legal measures to
discourage the stripping of metadata and other identifiers without good reason, at the same
time encouraging the respect for and use of metadata at every stage in the life of an image -
from the moment it is created using a digital camera (relevant to camera manufacturers), to
when it is shared or licensed (relevant to social media platforms and photo agencies), to every
time it is used in a digital environment (relevant to businesses of all sectors). One of the early
outputs from a work stream under the auspices of the UK Copyright Hub has in fact been to
draw up a 10 point voluntary code of conduct along these lines, please see:
http://www.clsg.info/Images_and_Metadata.html.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention38 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
        – Please explain
The term should be long enough to insure a rightsholder and her/his dependents receive
fair and full economic benefits from their works. BAPLA firmly believes there should be
no reduction to the term of 70 years post mortem auctoris, as this would harm the
rightsholder without giving any substantial benefit to the public.
It is worth noting that, even today, many visual works are not recognized during the
lifetime of the rightsholder or that they gain value only after their death.
In the sphere of online use, any shortening of the term would effectively transfer the
right of the creative rightsholder to Internet stakeholders who were not part of the
creation or original publication of the work letting those organisations reap the benefit
of the initial investment.
        – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC39.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law40. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 41, these limitations and

39
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
41
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

                                                                                                            22
exceptions are often optional42, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")43.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
         – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
        – Please explain
The businesses of our members are built to accommodate current copyright exceptions
of Member States. BAPLA believes that the current set of optional exceptions and
limitations achieves the right balance. The problems arise when the scope of the
exceptions is broadened (as currently in the UK) in a way that impacts the right to
property of rightsholders. Any suggestion of broadening the scope without sufficient and

42
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
43
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           23
compelling evidence for introducing exceptions, observing the impact on all creators,
would have a substantial impact that would go beyond current comprehension and
create much uncertainty in the market.




22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
        – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    O – Please explain
Whilst harmonisation might be appealing conceptually, especially when concerned with
copyright law, it should not be forgotten that Member States have differing legal
traditions; some based on common law, others based on civil law. Therefore some
Member States will be extremely attached to exceptions that have been implemented in a
way that is complimentary to national cultures. Any further harmonisation may be met
with resistance if they were to be seen as being “forced upon” Member States in a way
that may jar with national customs. We therefore favour the pragmatic approach taken
by the EU so far, which brings a level of harmonisation whilst still respecting the
diversity of national traditions.
We do not see that any further harmonisation in the area of exceptions is needed in
order to provide for greater flexibility in the digital age. Certainly in the images sector,
rightsholders are already finding ways to fuel and partner with new and emerging
technology based business models.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
No, stability is good for future investment and the courts are generally doing a good job of
applying existing exceptions to new technological uses.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
        – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
       – Please explain why


                                                                                               24
Flexibility in this area would lead to greater uncertainty and instability. One of the
benefits of the EU framework of limitations and exceptions is that its prescriptive nature
lends itself to a greater level of certainty amongst right-holders and users alike. Each is
able to make investment decisions with one less variable to consider. This is an
advantage of the EU copyright system when compared to a US based “fair use” regime.
It would be damaging to lose that certainty.
The US concept of fair use, based on a case-by-case balancing of certain factors, might
seem appealing, but in reality has led to a number of costly lawsuits. Even judges and
lawyers come to mixed conclusions as to whether a particular use is ‘fair’ or not. This
complexity and uncertainty, not to mention cost, does not benefit society or creators.
Aside from lawsuits, uncertainty may cause businesses to shy away from investment,
and creators to avoid creating new works. We much prefer a legal framework that
offers clarity, predictability and lower costs as a result. As Mickey H. Osterreicher,
general counsel for the US National Press Photographers said, “Fair use started out as
an exception to copyright law, now it seems that copyright is the exception to fair use.”
please see http://nyti.ms/1jSAA03
In addition, to introduce a greater degree of flexibility would only favour those with
deep pockets wishing to use copyright work at the edges of an exception/limitation, as it
is those users that can most easily afford to test the boundaries or, worse still, prey on
the knowledge that less well resourced creators and rightsholders may be unwilling to
take the financial risk of challenging such uses. This concern is especially acute in the
images sector as it is made up of a highly fragmented set of relatively small
rightsholders. There are not the same business giants in the images sector as there are in
other creative sectors such as with films and music.




25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
We do NOT believe that a greater degree of flexibility in the area of exceptions and
limitations would be helpful and, indeed, it would more likely be damaging. Please see our
answer to Q.24.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?

The EU is a rich and diverse collection of nation states. Trading across the EU often
requires commercial knowledge of local market conditions. Our members trade with
other EU agents who employ local skills that capitalizes on market conditions.
Standard licensing practice is that end users are required through contract to ensure the
lawful use of an image.
In those territories where an exception to copyright is prescribed, local market
conditions determine whether goods and services are saleable. We are not in favour of
any further harmonization of the territoriality of copyright limitations and exceptions
without a deeper understanding of its economic impact. We would advocate change not
for change’s sake, but only where this has demonstrable benefit to society.
As a sole exception to the above (no pun intended), we would argue the case for greater
harmonization of moral rights, which is poor in the UK. The absence of an automatically
arising paternity right in the UK, we feel, has likely contributed considerably to the
orphan works problem for images.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving44 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions45. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive46.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of

44
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the

                                                                                           27
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
        – Please explain with specific example




BAPLA members do not negotiate agreements direct with libraries, and in the UK are
not beneficiaries of remuneration through the Public Ending Right (PLR) scheme, but
they do negotiate agreements with publishers to include images within books, which
books are then made available by libraries.
E-lending equates to a whole new distribution model, for which ALL rights holders,
including the rightsholders of embedded works, should derive benefit.
Under an e-lending scheme, publishers would need to ensure that all rights are cleared
for such purposes to safeguard the interests of libraries and respective rightsholders,
otherwise the libraries would be at risk of facilitating unlawful access to photos
embedded within publications. Libraries should work to ensure both equitable access
and incentives for licensing eBooks and to eReaders. With proper rights management
systems in place photographers could, but currently do not benefit from remuneration.
Any improper management could be quite harmful to rightsholders such as
photographers, especially considering that e-lending could conceivably create a
secondary market in competition with the first market. This harm would be further
compounded if digital exhaustion were ever also introduced (see our comments in
response to Q.14).




                                                                                             29

 [Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….




The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

As described in our response to Q.36, there are potentially problems for image rightsholders if
e-lending schemes are improperly managed without having due regard to, and accounting in
respect of, images contained within publications.


Already in existence are a number of commercial or public-private partnership e-lending
schemes; some already offer remote access to a considerable range of titles. Examples include
Amazon Kindle, Oyster, Bilbary Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, which currently do not yet
consider fair remuneration for rightsholders works embedded in online publications, such as
the PLR scheme.


Intermediary schemes such as Canada’s e-bookstore Bilbary are utilising public libraries as a
new e-books sales channels, publishers such as Hachette USA, see libraries as a means to sell
their back e-catalogues. Kindle Owners’ Lending Library gives access to over 200,000 books
to readers in UK, France, Germany and the US. Books can be borrowed for free with no due
return dates. Authors who enrol under the Kindle Owners scheme are directly remunerated.


These new models offer libraries new opportunities. A public library may create new
relationships with say local authors, or by focusing on specialist subject areas a USP.




                                                                                             30
With these new opportunities comes the added responsibility to balance the educational,
social and commercial needs carefully, ideally to the benefit of public libraries and to
rightsholders which includes embedded works. This requires more careful consideration in the
context of public-private partnerships. The commercialisation of libraries is not a path the EU
should follow, public/private partnerships challenge core public access principles, which have
always been altruistic and ethical and act as an information commons for the community in
which it operates. Private companies are beholden to shareholders not to the public.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other47. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)48.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
         – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
The 2011 MoU must take into consideration the views of image rights owners, before
legislation is even considered. This paper does not take into consideration the rights of
authors whose work has been embedded within other works, which they may consider to
be commercial. These rights owners were not represented in discussions and for the
main are non-members or ‘outsiders’ of the collecting society regime. The largest
criticism of the MoU was “but what about the images?” BAPLA would be supportive in
providing guidance in this area.

47
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
48
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             31

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
            – Please explain
As noted in our response to Q.40, the MoU does not consider the use of images properly.
We believe the reason is because the vast majority of photographers and picture
agencies across Europe are not represented by collecting societies for visual arts, whose
primary membership typically includes artists such as painters, sculptures, architects,
etc. It cannot be because it is “too difficult” to identify embedded images within books.
This is something many of our members do on a daily basis in conjunction with their
newspaper customers, in order to determine which images have been included and
therefore need to be licensed. Image recognition technology is available that would make
this a perfectly manageable task.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC49 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC51 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 52.

The Marrakesh Treaty53 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics54 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

54
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              35
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”55. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs56. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded

56
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           37
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions57.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
         – Please explain by giving examples
Images are routinely posted to social media websites without permission of
rightsholders, in breach of copyright. This is rarely policed as the costs of enforcement
are prohibitive and the prospect of recovering damages from individuals posting the
content is low. It also poses a moral issue, as it is usually only the service provider that
benefits financially from such postings, either via advertising revenue around the
postings and/or by amassing data on the individuals who make the postings. However,
the prospects of recovering compensation from the service providers are equally low as
they are able to shield themselves from liability by availing themselves of the hosting
defence under the E-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EU).
This is an undesirable situation, leaving rightsholders feeling helpless and unable to
properly protect their works, and users vulnerable to the possibility of liability. It also
means that none of the revenue generated by the platforms hosting the content finds its
way back to rightsholders whose content is helping to fuel the success of the platform.
The scale of this problem and the revenues at stake are huge. By way of example,
Pinterest is a photo-sharing website that allows users to create and manage image
collections such as events, interests and hobbies made up of photos they have found on
the web, many of which will belong to third party rightsholders. In October 2013,
Pinterest secured a $250 million round of equity funding, valuing the platform at $3.8
billion.
We would therefore urge the EU to re-examine the safe harbour provisions under the E-
Commerce Directive (2000/31/EU). These problems could be eased if those benefitting
from the hosting defence were obliged to provide rightsholders with a choice of either
blocking their content from being uploaded (and therefore withdrawing any content
already uploaded) or sharing in the profits derived from its use on a proportionate basis.
An example of such a mechanism is the Content ID system operated by YouTube in
respect of video and music but not, as yet, for images. The technology available to
monitor third party images posted in this way is readily available and would not require
platforms to develop their own Content ID systems, they could license in the technology
in a cost effective way.

57
  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .

                                                                                                     38
These steps would not mean less content being published, YouTube is evidence to the
contrary of that, it would simply mean that content could be licensed in a frictionless
manner with more content being published legally, in turn also generating more taxable
economic transactions. This direct licensing solution would be a more desirable outcome
than any kind of levy on social media platforms or blanket collective license scheme as it
would enable rightsholders to be compensated directly in a timely manner and allow
them to retain the choice of whether to allow their content to be exploited. It would be a
clear win-win solution and a benefit to all.




59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a rightsholder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
        – Please explain
(a) The lack of proper identification is both a by-product and a cause of UGC being
unlicensed. If an item of content is not properly identified, viewers of the content will
find it more difficult to locate the rightsholder to purchase a licence should they wish to
re-use the content themselves. The route to better identification is through preserving
and respecting metadata. Please see our comments in response to Q.19 in this regard.
In addition, there are various visual reverse search tools available today that help with
identifying the rightsholder of an image. Examples include PicScout (www.picscout.com)
and TinEye (www.tineye.com). These tools are free and easy to use.

62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

To manage transformative use, we believe what is required is the correct permissions-based
environment, one that facilities collaboration and sometimes, but not always, the creation of a
new work.
Again, please see our comments in response to Q.58, in particular our suggestion that the E-
Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC) be re-examined.
In essence, the key characteristics of any new legislative solution are that it should not
provide owners of UGC populated platforms/websites with a safe harbour against
infringement unless they are doing all they can to avoid infringement, by providing
rightsholders with a means of blocking the content or licensing it to the platform/website
owner on a “live” basis and on terms set by the platform/website owner. The burden should be
shifted from rightsholders to those website/platform owners that are benefitting financially
from UGC being posted by third parties.

 IV.      Private copying and reprography

                                                                                            40
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying58. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5960.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions61 in the digital environment?
         – Please explain
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This
results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At
the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of
private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member
States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes, which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.
That said, whilst clarification in this area would be welcome, we would not advocate an
extension of the levy system into new areas in an attempt to address more recent
problems in the online world such as P2P file sharing and UGC proliferation. We would
instead advocate automated, technology based direct licensing solutions involving the
identifying of rightsholders for specific items of content by the use of metadata, thus
resulting in a more precise and equitable remittance of funds to rightsholders.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers64 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 65. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant

     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The authors (photographers) represented by our members have all elected to rely on direct
licensing as the preferable mechanism for exploiting their images. This allows the
author/rightsholder to decide on which agency in which to place their trust for representing
their works and to switch agencies (or represent themselves independently) should they
become unhappy, thus encouraging a highly competitive market amongst photo agencies.
Technology makes it increasingly possible for agencies to trace uses on the Internet and
manage rights on a machine-readable basis.
Developments in direct licensing methods and practices means that he case for collective
management of rights, at least for images, is dwindling.

     VI.      Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE66 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text67. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose68. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure69. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
            – Please explain
The cost of enforcement is prohibitive and disproportionate to the revenues from
exploitation/damages. Cheaper and quicker court procedures as well as the appointing
of dedicated copyright expert judges, will all help improve the situation. The UK
Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (formerly Patents County Court), which offers
services such as the Small Claims Track enabling rightsholders to pursue low value IP
claims, is a step in the right direction. Also recently introduced and advocated by
BAPLA is the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) funded by the UK
government to combat IP crime with a focus on offences committed online.


           – Please explain

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

66
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
67
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
68
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
69
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           45

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?



Such radical reform would be incompatible with the different member state copyright
systems, each of which has evolved in its own right and is now engrained in local
national culture. In the absence of compelling economic evidence that a single EU
copyright title would bring with it net benefits, we do not think this would be a
productive or sensible route to take.




79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]


                                                                                           46

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
This consultation does not consider impact on non-harmonized related rights, such as moral
rights. Creators in the UK have fought long and hard for moral right reform. A closer
harmonization of the rules relating to moral rights would be welcomed. In the case of the UK,
any move towards supporting access of content throughout the EU could not be possible
without a robust framework of knowing who that content belongs to. Harmonised moral rights
laws would help in this regard.
An important overriding matter that has not been expressly addressed in this consultation is
the general approach to be taken with any legislative reform. Laws should always be
technology neutral, as otherwise they would quickly become dated. Technology moves much
faster than any legislative machine ever will. However, laws should continue to be cognisant
of the different types of copyright work (text, music, video, images, etc.), as they will all
remain distinct forms of creative expression for generations to come, irrespective of the
precise technological means by which they are communicated or reproduced. In this regard,
we would encourage EU lawmakers not to be shy in providing further granularity and detail in
respect of different types of copyright works and industry sectors. Different types of copyright
work merit different treatment in many situations; having regard to their respective
characteristics and where/how they are consumed.
Our comments are made from the perspective of image rightsholders and their representatives.
They are best placed to say which solutions are likely to work best for their sector. We hope
this will be given due consideration.
Finally, we would also encourage the EU lawmakers to take a long-term view with the aim of
fostering a rich cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations. This will not be
achieved by introducing new exceptions but only by finding more innovative licensing
solutions. In the words of Jean Michel Jarre, President of CISAC: “Artists were here before
electricity and will be here long after the internet....We [creators and tech companies] need
each other, so at the end of the day we have to find the right partnership. Our creators are the
identity we are going to leave for future generations. If we don’t solve this we’ll end up with
just white noise”
