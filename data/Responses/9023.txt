     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).



9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
It is not possible to access broadcasts (both recorded and real time) in any country outside of
the UK because of licensing and broadcast restrictions. This is particularly detrimental to
students who are taking UK university courses at partner institutions overseas in the EU
and/or where the UK Universities have overseas campuses because they are not permitted
access to the same resources via a secure electronic network and/or the provisions of any
blanket licences negotiated by the UK University do not extend to students based outside of
the UK. Licence fees increase but the provision of services does not improve, and this hinders
the breadth of teaching and learning resources to which students based at partner institutions
have access.
     NO
     NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
An exception or limitation permitting both the recording of broadcasts and the communication
of those broadcasts via secure networks for educational purposes, with the caveat that contract
terms and technical protection measures cannot override these exceptions. The licensing body
for educational broadcasts in the UK cannot provide a licence for the making available of
broadcasts via a secure network to the rest of the EU because other Member States do not
have a provision in their national laws which permits the recording of broadcasts for
educational purposes. This must be addressed in EU legislation.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?



                                                                                             9
     YES – Please explain
Territoriality in licensing is a barrier to cross-border availability of content and services. For a
Single Market to be able to function in the digital realm any measures or regulations which
unnecessarily complicate the use of content and services via the Internet should be
investigated and simplified.

B.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would
be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
The law of the supplying country (“country of origin” approach) should apply with regard to
copyright exceptions. These exceptions should be implemented as a mandatory minimum
norm across the EU. Users and service providers should not have to understand another EU
country’s copyright law to be able to use and provide content and services, particularly given
the wide variety of languages across the EU. A principled and technology neutral definition of
"making available" is needed.
An approach which targets groups of customers would be detrimental to the advance of the
cultural heritage sector in the EU as it would increase the burden of rights clearances and
undermine the public interest objective of dissemination of culture and knowledge throughout
the EU.
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have



22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

circumstances, and why

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
copyright exception)
In our opinion, a hyperlink is equivalent to a signpost directing the end user to the
resource/information and should not therefore be protected by copyright. Without the ability
to link Web sites and move from one site to another, users of the Internet will not be able to
function lawfully. The Association Litteraire et Artistique Internationale (ALAI) produced a
report and opinion in 2013 which investigated many different types of hyperlinking. This
report found that not all hyperlinks are equal in their ‘communicating’ of copyright works (i.e.
some hyperlinks are factual) and that in order to relieve confusion for users (some of which
has arisen as a result of various court cases) the EU should instigate limitations and
exceptions for the use of hyperlinks27. This question has recently been addressed by the Court
of Justice in case C-466/12 Svensson. The Court found that hyperlinks are an act of public
communication but are not infringing unless they are addressed to a “new public” (a public
that was not taken into account by the copyright holders when the initial communication was
authorised).




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

  ALAI, REPORT and OPINION on the making available and communication to the public in the internet
environment – focus on linking techniques on the Internet. ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 16 SEPTEMBER 2013. p.10. (the irony of including a link to the report is not lost
here – should referencing require the permission of the rightsholder??)


                                                                                                   13
The viewing of a webpage is the standard result of any use of the Internet; there is no reason
why such a reproduction on screen should be subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder.
If the rightsholder wanted such control over webpages, they should use technical measures
(such as placing the content behind a password-protected site) to prevent such viewing
without payment/permission. The temporary copying exception permits the storage of pages
within the cache, but does not appear to extend to the viewing on screen. If the EU Parliament
considers it necessary, then an exception should be created for viewing on screen, but the EU
Parliament should not become confused between access rights and copyright. Just because an
item is available online should not make it any different than if one were to go to a library or
archive to view such an item. The fact that the original is reproduced in order to transmit the
content quickly over the Internet is not the fault of the end user and therefore there should not
be a penalty on those who view information in that way. If the rightsholder did not want a
user to view the content, they should not have made Web pages available in the first place; the
Internet is for the dissemination of information.

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 29. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 31.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
A registration system at EU level would help to identify works which are protected by
copyright and who the rightsowners are. At present, it is often difficult to discover and/or
contact rightsowners for permission to use works outside the scope of limitations and
exceptions. A registration system at EU level would have to be a voluntary system with
incentives for rightsholders to register. Other information, such as works where copyright has
expired, could also be included, as well as links to repositories such as Europeana.
The registration system would need to be marketed well across the EU. Rightsholders should
be able to self-register and fields must be mandatory rather than optional when filling in
information. There must a requirement to keep the data within the registration system current.
Much of this work would need to be done by rightsholders, but the EU would benefit from
using information professionals to ensure that the data and metadata is appropriately managed
and arranged. Rightsholders of non-commercial works should not have to pay to
register/deposit their works provided they maintain their own data. The system should also be
funded by the EU.
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Registration of copyright works would lead to fewer works becoming orphans in the future,
because rightsholders could be traced more easily and also the copyright inherent in a lot of
user generated content would eventually be eliminated. It would also make it easier for

30
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                            15
authors/creators to take action for copyright infringement, as they would be able to prove their
ownership of copyright simply and cheaply.
The current requirement for non-registration applies to Berne Convention works, whose
duration is typically author’s life plus 50 years. One incentive of the scheme could be if the
rightsowner wished to take advantage of an extra 20 years of copyright protection in the EU
(i.e. author’s life plus 70 years). This could be done without any need to change the Berne
Convention.
Registration for the extra period would also mean that only those who wish to assert their
copyright for the extra period would benefit from twenty extra years, and provide a practical
way of differentiating between the authors of works who wish to commercially exploit them,
and those who have no interest in benefitting commercially.
17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
There are some disadvantages. Firstly, copyright registration for all works from EU Member
States would need a lot of administration, and the EU should look to the US Copyright Office
to better understand registration of copyright works. Several years ago there was a backlog of
approximately 24 months of works still to be registered at the US Copyright Office 32.
Secondly, there is a question around whether the copyright works themselves should be
deposited or just the metadata. If it is the works themselves, the technical infrastructure must
be robust enough to handle all the different types of works from literary to audiovisual works
(often extremely large files), and this must be easily searchable via an online interface.
Finally, copyright lasts for author’s life plus 70 years, and there are concerns that a
repository/registration system would be able to move in line with the technology and ensure
format shifting of works for the next 100 years at least. As such, the practicalities would need
serious consideration before such a system was implemented.
18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
As we have indicated in Q16, one advantage would be to get the full benefit of copyright
duration of author’s life + 70 years rather than author’s life + 50 years. Further incentives
could be drawn from modelling the registration system on the US system, including the
requirement for works to be registered in order for authors/creators to begin legal proceedings
against those who use their work unlawfully.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 33, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 34 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The

Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Linked Content Coalition35 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 36 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
The EU should continue to promote the adoption of identifiers and ensure that silos of content
are not created. Rights and permissions databases must be interoperable and available to all
content creators, and identifiers must be based on standards to ensure consistency. The EU
should encourage participation from all stakeholders, including libraries, archives and users,
so that databases are developed with the users in mind. Databases should link up with the
work already done as listed above, and also with other work done around standards and
cataloguing (e.g. by Europeana).

Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention37 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
         – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Many of the problems we now have derive from the fact that copyright term is too long. Most
commercially-released works are only financially viable for about 10 years from publication,
which suggests that the current copyright term of 70 years from the death of the author/creator
is too long. Most older works are often only available in and accessible via libraries and
archives, who receive deposits of works rather than the transfer of copyright in the majority of

cases. This can cause problems in that users wishing to use older works in ways which are
outside the scope of the limitations and exceptions have to attempt to contact rightsholders,
who may be several generations on from the original author and have different ideas about
how the works should be used. In the fast-paced digital environment, the current term of
copyright is too long and hinders sharing of culture and knowledge across borders.
It is now time for the EU to evaluate the duration of copyright to establish:
o Whether the current copyright term of author’s life plus 70 years brings any significant
benefits to rightsholders;
o Whether these benefits outweigh the burdens to education and research, e.g. a growing body
of orphan works;
o What economic gains and possibilities could arise for all stakeholders if the copyright term
in the EU were to be shortened (e.g. to duration of author’s life only, or author’s life plus 50
years), allowing works to enter the public domain at an earlier point than currently.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC38.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law39. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 40, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional41, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"

may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")42.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The current copyright acquis has required copyright exceptions to be implemented piecemeal
across the EU, making the law inconsistent between Member States and therefore making it
more difficult for cross-border collaboration in the fields of culture, education and research.
There is a danger that without mandatory minimum norms for copyright exceptions, areas
such as culture, education and research will suffer in the cross-border digital environment,
making it impossible to achieve world-class research and free movement of knowledge. In the
Internet age, such sentiments apply not only to the EU Single Market, but also to the
worldwide digital environment, and the EU should seek to address this.
As research and teaching activity across national borders is now commonplace, the
differences in national copyright law create divisions that undermine effective collaboration
and knowledge sharing. This situation gives rise to an unfair imbalance allowing rights
holders to benefit from harmonised protection and enforcement measures whilst not allowing
libraries, archives and their users to benefit from mandatory minimum exceptions to ensure
effective working in the digital environment. This is particularly pertinent when scientists and
researchers from different countries are collaborating on research projects with particular
research outputs. The imbalance of copyright exceptions across the EU means that some
researchers can be disadvantaged from accessing and using certain copyright works
depending upon where they are based.
Libraries and archives are essential components in the information and copyright chain, yet
they and their users (including the very people who invent, create and discover) are at a

42
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19

Ideally, to ensure harmonisation, all exceptions in the Information Society Directive
2001/29/EC and other existing and future Directives in the copyright acquis should be

expand or add exceptions as required at an EU level which is responsive to technological

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
All of the suggestions listed below are expanded on elsewhere in this consultation document.
We recommend:
1. Introducing the principle that contracts and technical protection measures are never allowed
to override existing and new limitations and exceptions in the EU. Furthermore, it should be
an offence to impose technical protection measures on any material that is no longer in
copyright;
2. Introducing a ‘right to lend’ for libraries, to include the right to lend digital media such as
e-books by remote download;
3. Introducing a specific exception for text and data mining which applies to both commercial
and non-commercial purposes, as well as published and unpublished works;
4. Make it an offence for any person or organisation to falsely claim that they own the
copyright to a work, make unjustified threats of an infringement action, or set up business
models based on infringements by not fully disclosing that works are in copyright;
5. Introducing an exception permitting libraries, archives and museums to undertake mass
digitisation of out-of-commerce works (including orphan works) for non-commercial
purposes and to communicate them to the public, without the need for a diligent search for
each individual rights holder;



                                                                                               20
6. Introducing an exception, as has recently occurred in Germany, requiring publicly and
charity-funded published research to be made available to the public free of charge in an Open
Access online repository within a stated number of months following original publication;
7. Introducing an exception to the communication to the public right to permit research access
to retracted and withdrawn works held in libraries and archives in digital formats that had
previously been communicated to the public;
8. Introducing an exception for recording and communicating of broadcasts by educational
establishments to students based elsewhere in the EU.
         24.     Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
         greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
         exceptions?
     YES – Please explain why
There may be a need for a broader fair use provision which is flexible in light of new
technologies and would allow the creation of a level playing field in the areas of education
and research between the EU and the US.
     NO – Please explain why

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
Built-in flexibility in the form of a fair use provision would be the best and quickest approach,
although periodic reviews of the copyright acquis would be a preferred secondary option.
A study undertaken in 2007 and confirmed in 2010 in the “Fair Use in the US Economy”
report by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), assessed and
quantified in financial terms the benefits deriving from the application of the “fair use”
doctrine in the US 43. It identified certain economic sectors as “fair use industries” (industries
where reliance on “fair use” is critical to their business) and analysed the contributions of
these industries to the American economy, their potential to grow, the number of people they
employed and other positive economic features.
The study found that:
1. Fair-use dependent industries combined grew faster than the economy as a whole between
2002 and 2007, rising 31% during this period and accounting for around 18% of the US
economic growth. From 2002-2007, revenues grew from $3.5 trillion to $4.5 trillion.
2. In 2006, “fair use” related industry value added was $2.2 trillion, one-sixth of the total
gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States (where “value added” is defined in the

report as “...a firm’s total output minus its purchases of intermediate inputs and is the best
measurement of an industry’s economic contribution to national GDP.”).
3. Exports from companies that benefit from “fair use” grew by 41% between 2002 and 2007.
4. The industry contributes significantly to US employment. Indeed, the so called “fair-use
economy”: (i) employed nearly 11 million people in the 2002-2007 period, with a $1.2 trillion
payroll; (ii) accounted for a $300 billion growth in the period considered, with the outcome
that firms that benefit from “fair use” employed about one out of every eight US workers.
On the other hand, industries bound by copyright control with no “fair use” aspect contributed
just $1.3 trillion to the US economy.
These studies show that the US economy is becoming more knowledge-based and is
increasingly dependent on information industries. In particular, the findings show that
industries that depend on “fair use” exceptions make a large contribution to US productivity.
Growth areas dependent on “fair use” include:
o manufacturers of consumer devices that allow individual copying of copyrighted
programming
o educational institutions
o software developers
o Internet search and Web hosting providers.
This indicates that a flexible copyright regime, which includes appropriate exceptions,
stimulates growth, creativity and innovation, in particular in the field of technology. The US
“fair use” regime enables economic growth in its information industries. This would imply
that unless the EU also adopts a similar flexible general ‘fair use’ exceptions framework, it
will always play second fiddle to the US in one of the few remaining growth industries open
to it.
The disadvantage of a fair use regime is that it opens the door for more uncertainty and
litigation. Periodic reviews of the copyright acquis may be slow and dependent on the
Parliament in charge. There are advantages and disadvantages to all approaches, but
flexibility is necessary to ensure the proper functionality of the copyright regime.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
See the comments made in Q21 for an explanation of why the inconsistency of exceptions
between member states causes problems. These inconsistencies would be removed if all EU
Member States had to implement all the exceptions as a mandatory minimum norm. This
would preserve their autonomy but ensure that market transactions could occur both for non-
commercial and commercial purposes.
  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
This should be addressed by the laws of the EU Member State which is supplying the service
or content; the laws of the supplying country should apply.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 44 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 45. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 46.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
UK: Cultural Heritage Sector: copying for preservation purposes (including format-shifting).
A public sector initiative to harvest websites for preservation purposes encountered repeated
problems with third party copyright material displayed on the websites. The archive had to
discover whether the government departments that created the websites had obtained licences

   Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                            23
that covered archiving. In many cases, they had not. The archive then had to try to contact the
rights owners for permission; often, there was no response from the rightsholder (in which
case the material was copied but kept in a dark archive), or permission was refused (so the
third party material had to be deleted).
Archivists and librarians in the UK struggle with the preservation exception because even
though they are primarily havens for research and learning, they cannot guarantee that the
items will not be used at some stage for direct or indirect commercial advantage. Archives in
particular are reliant on commercial transactions with companies wishing to use archival
material on merchandise such as crockery, and if an original item had been copied in order to
preserve it, that copy may be used as the basis for the commercial gain.
The preservation exception is very limited in its use within the UK as a result of the language;
the term “indirect commercial advantage” in Article 5.2(c) of the Information Society
Directive is too broad and covers too wide an area for this exception to be of much use.
Preservation is fundamental to the mission of the cultural sector, and all cultural heritage
institutions (as well as a significant proportion of private individuals) already copy to preserve
because the risks of NOT copying for preservation far outweigh the risk of abiding by current
legislation. There is no evidence that this type of copying has been economically
disadvantageous to rightsholders.
  NO
  NO OPINION


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The cultural heritage sector should be permitted to make copies of works in their collections
for preservation purposes regardless of whether they are commercial or non-commercial
organisations. Preservation of copyright works is a core activity of the mission of the cultural
heritage sector and should be an essential part of EU policy; too many works have already
been lost as a result of failure to preserve or back-up. The EU must clarify the scope of the
existing EU legislation and broaden the existing exception to allow institutions across the EU
to reproduce all types of copyright works in their collection, otherwise archives and special
collections risk losing large amounts of audio-visual material without having the lawful
ability to copy from one medium to another to keep up with changes in technology. Waiting
until copyright expires also dramatically increases the cost of preservation as the expertise,
techniques and hardware required become rarer and rarer.

elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
See the comments in Q28 and Q29

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e., when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[a: institutional user from UK Higher Education library]: No specific problems have been
experienced because we do not tend to deal with the actual rights holders of e-Books or e-
Journals articles. Our contractual licences are either with publishers, content providers or
intermediary bodies such as Jisc or Eduserv. These require little or no negotiation in terms of
rights access as the contracts are written up with the Higher Education Institution in mind.
The only grey area is around what constitutes an ‘affiliate institution’. We are currently
looking into extending our licences in one or two cases to cover these since there are a few
smaller institutions that have fairly informal agreements with some of our colleges around use
of resources.

More broadly, having to negotiate agreements with rightsholders can lead to a large variety of
differing contracts, meaning that an activity which is permitted by one rightsholder is not
permitted by another. This can create closed communities and end up stifling research.
National libraries in the UK do not make their databases available to users to consult online
because they cannot negotiate the appropriate permissions from rightsholders. Yet users
expect to be able to access and use databases nowadays from wherever they are. The view of
the UK government is that authors can be rewarded for e-loans made on the library premises
but not for remote loans. Making a proper, online service available to users will be difficult
under current legislation and policy, both nationally and at an EU level, so change is needed
to ensure appropriate availability of works for patrons.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Changes in legislation are needed so that libraries across the EU are always permitted to allow
off-site access for any patron to any materials which it owns or has a licence for, and that any
contractual term that purports to restrict this ability shall be deemed null and void.



                                                                                             25
34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
See comment in Q33. The conditions should be that the services should be provided to
registered users via the Internet.

3.       E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
[a: a UK Higher Education library] No. All our e-resources are available online to all our
current students and staff, regardless of where they are in the world. The only exception is
BoB (Box of Broadcasts) which uses an IP geo-blocking mechanism to bar access to off-air
recordings from outside of the UK. This is due to the restrictions of the Educational
Recording Agency licence. In order to strengthen this, we also have to use an additional
eduperson attribute in our Shibboleth set-up which guarantees that our users are registered at
the university.
Public libraries: There are key differences in the way scholarly publishers and trade
publishers operate and, as a result, they take different approaches to digital sales and digital
lending. As the primary market for scholarly publishing is academic libraries, and public
libraries purchase mainly trade books, some of the challenges faced by the two sectors are
fundamentally different. Digital distribution of scholarly publications to academic libraries is
long standing and there are established protocols on the use of the content. In contrast, the
market demand for trade e-books is a recent development directly tied to the explosion in e-
reader sales in 2010. Some trade publishers view library availability of e-books as a direct


                                                                                             26
threat to their economic interest and are withholding sales. They argue that, if people can
borrow an e-book, why would they buy one? Piracy of popular titles is also a concern.
As a consequence of the legal context and uncertainty over whether the principle of EU
exhaustion of the distribution right that applies in the case of the distribution of physical
copies can also be applied in the case of e-books, many of the practices and policies that were
under the exclusive control of the library are now a matter of negotiation with publishers
and/or distributors. For the first time the ability to acquire commercially published books for
library collections is constrained. The supplier decides what is in a subscription package. The
result is that the library may not be able to present to its users the very best literature or the
most specialized literature on a subject.
The right to interlibrary loan an e-book also requires both negotiated licence conditions and a
technical capability that many public libraries do not have access to.
Research conducted in February 2013 by Shelf Free, an independent group set up and led by
librarians to raise awareness of the opportunities and issues around e-books in public libraries,
found that 85% of e-books were not available to public libraries. Out of the top 50 most
borrowed adult fiction books of 2012, only 7 were available for public libraries to buy as e-
books – and even then it depended on which supplier the library service was signed up to.
With one supplier, only two titles were available.
In November 2013, Surrey libraries submitted evidence to EBLIDA of the difficulties public
libraries are having getting licences for e-content from some publishers and the excessive
terms and conditions that are being imposed on any sales:
Libraries have difficulty in getting e- content from some Publishers.
1) Top publishes such as Macmillan, Penguin and Simon and Schuster will not make titles
available for the UK market.
2) Even publishers such as Random House who do offer e-books through Surrey Libraries’
supplier withhold the front list titles.
3) From the Bookseller official top 50 ranking for eBooks in August 2013, only six were
available for purchase and five of these were from the same author and were published in
2012.
4) Popular titles such as Dan Brown’s Inferno are available in the US but not in e-book format
in the UK (just e-Audio).
Excessive Terms and Conditions
1) Most licence agreements are one user one copy (although Overdrive, Surrey’s supplier,
does offer simultaneous access and metered access titles).
2) HarperCollins metered access only allows 26 checkouts. This is limiting and not good
value for money. Titles are slightly cheaper, but can still be expensive for public libraries
who have small stock budgets, given more copies may need to be purchased for the more
popular titles.
3) Titles are expensive. New and popular titles that are available are usually around £42.50.
Given this cost you cannot always buy the required number to satisfy user demand. Some
titles are available to buy from the bookseller for as little as 99p.
For example: Some vendors able to mark down titles such as Khaled Hosseini's “And The
Mountains Echoed” to 99p, Nook “Hot Summer Reads” and Amazon matched the price.
The same title through OverDrive cost £42.50 to buy.

                                                                                                27
4) There are some simultaneous access plans offered, however the ones available at the
moment do not appear to be good value for money. Whilst they give unlimited access, many
of them are not titles that might get excessive demand. They also usually restrict you to 25
titles and some can be around £2,000, which is not cost effective. Libraries like to supply a
breadth of titles, so with this amount of money and with limited budgets, often more one user,
one copy titles are purchased instead.
  NO
  NO OPINION

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By creating an exception allowing libraries to purchase e-books for lending virtually through
remote downloads or by streaming. It is important that libraries' collection building policies
are consistent and decided by the librarians themselves, not by publishers and vendors, in the
digital world just as it is in the analogue world.

Secondly, the EU should confirm that the principle of exhaustion applies to sales of all digital
materials as indicated in the Court of Justice of the European Union’s UsedSoft ruling. This
would create more legal certainty around sale and loan of digital materials.

Finally, as the Public Lending Right applies to physical lending of books and materials, so it
should also apply to the digital lending of copyright works by EU public libraries to ensure
that authors and creators are rewarded for the use of their works.


38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[UK public libraries]: Within the conceptual system of copyright legislation, lending
constitutes a subgroup under the category of “distribution”. The rightsholder has exclusive
control over whether to publish or not, but after the first sale the distribution right is
exhausted. Once exhausted, the rightsholder cannot control subsequent lending or re-sale of
the physical object, which includes printed books. As a consequence, the library decides in
accordance with its collection building policy what books to buy and use for lending. The
library can keep these books indefinitely or sell/ give them away. Publishers and some legal
scholars, in their interpretation of copyright law, argue that e-lending is a service, whereby
content is “communicated to the public”, but the exhaustion doctrine does not apply to
services. As a result the library can only acquire an e-book by entering into a licence
agreement with the rightsholders and the rightsholders are free to decide whether they want to
give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such access. The library cannot
loan e-books without authorisation and e-books cannot be sold or given away. In addition,
public library e-books cannot be downloaded onto the popular Kindle e-reader in the UK at
present because Amazon, who own the Kindle, will not allow it. These challenges are making
it difficult for public libraries to manage digital collections and are severely limiting their
ability to provide a wide range of e-books, to mirror what they do with printed books. The UK
and Ireland have recognised that this is a problem and have acknowledged that work needs to
be done to ensure that contracts do not override exceptions to copyright.


                                                                                             28
39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
There is little difference these days between ‘on-premises consultation’ and ‘off-premises
consultation’. There may still be a few more hindrances to effective communication online,
compared to face-to-face, but the medium through which consultation takes place should not
affect the help or advice imparted to the user.
UK Higher Education library: Problematic differences between traditional lending and e-
lending centre around access (or lack of access) to material. The advantages of electronic
over print in terms of 24/7 access are obvious and well-documented, but when things go
wrong, such as authentication issues (user accounts), hosted content server issues, network
issues, etc., then the attractiveness of being able to hold a physical book or journal in the
patron’s hands dramatically increases. However, it is frustrating for a user to spend time,
money and effort getting to a physical library during opening hours, only to discover that the
physical book or journal that they wanted cannot be found on the shelves, or has been defaced
or damaged.
UK Public libraries: Through traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or
public lending and activities such as off-premises consultation and e-lending, public libraries
promote reading and learning, thereby contributing to key policy objectives, such as the
creation of literate and articulate individuals and communities that can better support
themselves.
Remote access is integral to the concept of e-lending and is essential if public libraries are to
continue to be an integral part of a networked society. There is substantial demand for remote
downloading, especially in the evenings when many public libraries are closed. However not
all supply models allow for remote downloading in addition to on-site access. In the digital
age library users expect nothing less. On-site only e-lending is overly restrictive, runs counter
to social inclusion policies, and will have a detrimental effect on library membership and
therefore the public library service, threatening its very existence. An “Independent Review
of E-Lending in Public Libraries in England”, commissioned by the UK Government and
written by William Sieghart, recommended in March 2013 that public libraries should be able
to offer remote e-Lending service to their readers. This recommendation was accepted by the
UK government.
As stated above, publishers are concerned that, if people can borrow e-books, especially
remotely, they will not buy them. However, research has found that libraries enhance rather
than damage sales and are important customers for publishers. In 2012 The Pew Research
Centre found that “the majority of readers of e-books (61%) prefer to purchase their own
copies rather than borrow them”. Research by the Centre also shows that libraries and
librarians are a prominent source (21%) for owners of e-reading devices to get
recommendations for reading materials 47. Libraries are ideally placed to showcase a wide
range of publishers’ output. A 2011 study by Library Journal and Bowker PubTrack
Consumer reports that 50% of all library users in the USA report purchasing books by an
author they were introduced to in the library48. OverDrive reported that, during March 2012,
5.02 million visitors viewed 146 million pages over 12.6 million visits to OverDrive-hosted

E-Lending in Public Libraries in England, a number of pilots have been set up in English
public libraries to test business models and user behaviours to provide more evidence of the
impact of e-lending on publishers’ business models.

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other50. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)51.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

The 2011 Memorandum of Understanding is too limited to be of any assistance to cultural
heritage organisations wishing to undertake mass digitisation of copyright works. A
Memorandum of Understanding cannot be enforced and is not the appropriate vehicle for

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightsholders are not members of the collecting society.

countries have acted on it to date. Additionally, no Memorandum of Understanding will ever
be of any use for archives, since there are no collecting societies for the bulk of archival
materials (e.g. unpublished literary works, documentary photographs, and oral sound
recordings).

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
We need exceptions that combine the mandatory minimum norms alongside extended
collective licensing schemes. Much material (including orphan works) held in cultural
heritage organisations such as libraries and archives was never commercially produced. This
includes a large quantity of audio-visual material where performers involved never had a
commercial purpose in mind.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC52 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
It is difficult to pinpoint specific problems, seeing as many teachers in the UK use images to
illustrate their presentations without knowing whether they are infringing copyright.
However, academics in the Arts and Humanities subjects often visit European archives and
are allowed to take copies of works for their own personal study as a result of licences given
by the archives. When they return to the UK, they want to prepare lectures to show students
these items and further to make the slides available to their students via a secure network. At

the moment, the licence restricts them from doing these activities, limiting the learning and
sharing of information in these subjects.
[UK Higher Education institution]: There is currently a discrepancy between the ‘on
premises’ acts of teaching and the same acts but in a ‘virtual’ environment. For example, film
clips may be shown to students in class but may not be made available to a class of the same
students learning overseas in the EU via the secure network of the Virtual Learning
Environment (VLE). One lecturer recently wanted to make a selection of short clips of feature
films available for viewing over the VLE to show students based across EU borders examples
of good and bad teaching styles and methods. However, under UK copyright law this type of
use is not covered under an exception, and it was also not possible to clear the rights in these
films for this type of use (the films ranged from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure Iranian
films). There was also no known collecting society through which a blanket licence for this
activity could be purchased. If all EU Member States implemented the exceptions as
mandatory minimum norms, this activity could have been done and ensured that students in
the virtual class were able to view the same material as students in the actual class on the
premises.
All Higher Education institutions in the UK have students studying in many different parts of
the world. It is reported that 12% of students (approximately 72,000) taking a degree outside
the UK are in the EU53.The University of Kent has campuses and centres in the EU at
Canterbury, Medway, Brussels, Paris, Athens and Rome. The University of Central
Lancashire has established a campus in Cyprus with taught subjects of business and
management, law, computing and mathematics. Cypriots traditionally study in Greece, where
approximately 10% of university places are reserved for Cypriots, and in the UK. According
to HESA statistics, 2.8% of non-UK students at UK higher education institutions in 2009-10
were from Cyprus. It is therefore vital that teaching becomes borderless, enabling Higher
Education institutions to share resources via a secure network with students overseas. It is
unfair to treat students who choose to study in the EU any differently to students who study in
the UK, and at present copyright law is creating restrictive boundaries which stifle learning
and development and take precious time away from the academics and administrators who are
trying to secure necessary permissions.
In most cases, time is too short to think about copyright or for getting the necessary
permissions; the focus is on teaching the subject in the most stimulating and visually
appealing way possible. Teachers should have the freedom to include material in their
lessons/presentations with minimal or no formality, because it is for the greater public good.
Licensing the use is not the solution, because usually the rights organisations want a detailed
list of everything that has been used, to whom and when, and this is not practical.
As online open courses (such as Massive Open Online Courses) continue to rapidly increase,
a teaching exception purely for face-to-face teaching is becoming less useful. Currently
course co-ordinators must rely on licensing rather than exceptions when creating MOOCs, yet
it could be argued that as the courses are online for a matter of weeks, they are purely a
teaching and learning resource and should therefore benefit from an exception. The US model
has succeeded because of the legislative provision of fair use, whereas in the EU it is more
difficult if not impossible to create an online course based on legislative provision alone. The
EU should set mandatory minimum norms across the EU and needs appropriate public policy
space to do this, especially as accessibility through licensing can be removed with little or no
warning.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
A mandatory minimum norm across the EU for the use of any copyright material for
illustration in teaching, which cannot be overridden by contract. At the moment, the
piecemeal approach means that the UK does not currently have this exception implemented,
resulting in potential infringement by teachers on a daily basis. Yet it is a requirement of the
quality assurance agencies such as Ofsted that lessons are appealing and stimulating, ensuring
that all children with all learning styles are included and can learn. Copyright law is failing
teachers and needs to be amended.
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
There are resources that can be purchased on subscription, and there are licences, which can
be purchased from collecting societies, or teachers can use works licensed under Creative
Commons licences. None of these is totally satisfactory: subscription resources often are not
exactly what teachers require for particular lessons, collecting society licences carry too heavy
an administrative reporting burden, and CC-licensed works are not always high quality
enough, or diverse enough for the specific subject matter that teachers need. An exception is
the only way for teachers to use the works they need.
The discrepancy across the EU with regards to this exception is staggering. In some Member
States, educational uses require a licence (e.g. universities in Spain pay collecting societies a
flat fee of 5 euro per student to allow reproduction and online uses of works for teaching
purposes). In France, each time a teacher wishes to use a work for the purpose of illustration
of teaching, the work and the teacher’s educational institution are checked to see whether they
are covered by the agreement. Such use must be then registered and reported. Collective
licensing schemes operate in other countries such as Denmark and Finland. A mandatory
minimum exception for teaching must be established across all Member States to ensure
consistency and provide the ability for teachers and lecturers to use the material they need
without having to check, pay or register use.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions
Mandatory minimum norms for copyright exceptions must be introduced throughout the EU,
allowing Member States the flexibility to widen exceptions as they see fit. These exceptions
must not be overridden by contracts or technical protection measures and must cover the use
of any copyright material for illustration in all types of face to face teaching.
46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See answer to Q44 and Q45.

C.         Research

national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open

formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
The difficulty here is the language of the Information Society Directive. It should be made
clearer that “scientific research” includes research in the arts and humanities. The capture of
information has increasingly become more varied and copyright law needs to reflect this to
allow students and academics a greater degree of flexibility when putting together their
research. Currently, students and staff researching and accessing audio-visual materials are
limited by premises (i.e. they may not take away a copy to work with in their own study
environment), which means that in order to continue their research, they may have to return to
specialist archives and libraries several times. Many researchers are publicly funded and have
limited travel budgets. Online access would transform this situation and this would be
particularly helpful to citizens in the EU’s poorest countries.
Furthermore, all publishers require academics to clear third party copyright material included
in their journal articles or monographs. Academics are encouraged by some rightsholders to
go overboard on rights clearances for very small amounts of third party material, as it takes
experience to recognise what material requires clearance and what is covered under a
permitted act. For some, the only option is to remove all third party material, particularly
where permission has been refused, have been ignored, or rights clearances take too long; yet
academics and researchers need to be able to show their knowledge of other research in their
area and give credibility to their own work. This can contribute to a chilling effect; people
self-censor themselves for fear of being unable to cope with complicated rights clearances.
Acquiring permissions can also be expensive and not all researchers will have a grant to fund
this activity.
Academics and students often want to present their research at conferences, or publish it
online via an institutional repository. Rights clearance for extracts from films, sound
recordings and broadcasts is often impossible, and this places researchers at a disadvantage as
they cannot communicate the full details of their research. Additionally, many academic
researchers now create short films to showcase their research (particularly in science). The
launch of new peer-reviewed scholarly journals that encourage researchers to include film and
video presentations as part of their submissions will exacerbate the problem.

  NO OPINION


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Main problems concern the lack of access to scientific material due to prohibitive licensing
and/or technological protection measures (TPMs). They could best be solved by promoting
and implementing open access principles. Perhaps in some cases collective licensing schemes
could be used in order to encourage publishers to make their publications available for

                                                                                            34
research activities. Such schemes (where a fee would be due) should cover commercial as
well as non-commercial research.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
In the UK, the national copyright law includes a defence of fair dealing for non-commercial
research or private study. At present, this defence is restricted to certain types of works, and is
therefore not as useful as it should be. However, legislative changes are expected to come into
force in 2014 to extend this defence to all types of copyright work55. Another mechanism is
the licensing of use of works for the purposes of research and study; academic libraries in
particular pay substantial subscription fees so that students and academics can access journal
articles, but the terms and conditions may only permit the download of one single copy for the
purposes of personal use. Licences are costly and restrictive, and as a result of the continual
increases in price, libraries are not able to subscribe to the full breadth of journals and other e-
resources that they would like. To illustrate this, in the UK, university expenditure on
electronic resources (including e-only journals, print and electronic journals, databases, e-
books and other digital documents) was £198,071,000 in 2011-12 (source: SCONUL). This is
over twice as much as universities pay for hard copy resources, and is a figure which is set to
rise given the increasing ways in which publishers bundle and sell their content. It is
becoming unsustainable for universities which, with dwindling government funds and
fluctuating student numbers, must find other ways to continue to fund the library in the face of
a number of changes and challenges within the Higher Education sector.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC56 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 57.

The Marrakesh Treaty58 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

[UK libraries]: The biggest problem is access to accessible formats for persons with
disabilities. This is often due to technical protection measures in the works which do not
always work with software that the person with disabilities has available to them.


     NO OPINION


51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
We would urge the EU to quickly sign up to the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to
Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities and then
ratify it which would bring about its implementation in all Member States.


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
The market has failed many persons with disabilities in that costs for accessible formats
greatly restrict access. Neither libraries nor individuals can always afford these, and licences
(as well as restrictive national exceptions for persons with disabilities) often prevent libraries
and individuals from copying or re-using the works to benefit other disabled persons.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 59 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless


59
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                               36
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”60. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
[UK service provider]: A national library was involved in a project to archive UK web sites
on a permissions basis from the rightsholders of websites. Having analysed the time it took
for the licensing department to actively negotiate full contracts (as opposed to simpler
permissions), an average 38 contracts successfully negotiated revealed a figure of around 475
days (circa 16 months) taken to negotiate from start to signature. This figure by definition
does not include contracts not successfully negotiated. Given the thousands of publishers that
exist globally for the approximate 645 million websites (source: Netcraft) it is not practical to
negotiate access to this material on a case by case basis in order to mine it for text or factual
data.

It is also difficult to ensure that one licence is interoperable with another given that all
contracts are different. Knowledge and research is undertaken across borders and across a
wide range of materials and sources, therefore differences in publishers’ subjective views as

Researchers should be able to access and use data more quickly in the digital age owing to the
technology that is available to enable them to do this. Finally, data mining covers the
extraction of facts and data which may not be protected by copyright but may be protected by
database right; this is also an obstacle to end users when trying to data mine.

54.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
There are many problems for researchers and libraries around text and data mining in terms of
the practicalities of it being a licensed activity. But there are questions over whether this is an
activity which falls under copyright law in the first place. Copyright holders have authorised
access to and communication of their works to libraries with the resultant knowledge that
users of libraries will have access to the works. To what extent does text and data mining
infringe or activate the exclusive rights within copyright? If it does, the authorisation of the
rights holders for access to their works is consistent with the concept of not making works
available to a “new public” as discussed by the Court of Justice in case C-466/12 Svensson.
If it is determined that text and data mining does fall under copyright, a specific exception for
text and data mining which applies to both commercial and non-commercial purposes should
be introduced to include a prohibition on technical protection measures and contracts
overriding it. This would provide a more level playing field for researchers. Both the USA
and Japan have legislative mechanisms which enable text and data mining; this puts the EU at
a major competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, the USA has recently passed a Bill on open
access which requires all publically funded research to be made available in formats and
under terms which specifically permit text and data mining 61. This type of legislative solution
would be welcome in the EU. The territoriality of copyright laws and plethora of different
licensing agreements makes it very difficult for cross-border text and data mining to take
place across different countries and international library collections.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
See response to Q54.

56.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
We do not think that any solution other than a legislative one is feasible, provided that text
and data mining is subject to copyright in the first place.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?

The Database Directive could potentially be a barrier to the use of text or data mining
methods. It has failed to protect the EU database community from competition from the US
and is of little use.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs62. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 63.

sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

 IV.        Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying64. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees6566.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions67 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
The act of reproduction should occur once only, when a digital file is purchased and
transferred to the end user’s media. The fact that individual users back up and transfer digital
files for preservation as much as for practical use on different forms of media should not
mean that the reproduction right as described under Article 5.2(b) should trigger the
application (if applicable) of private copying levies. The principle of exhaustion should apply
to digital purchases as it does to physical ones; this will prevent instances of double payment.
The EU should clarify this to ensure that the scope is not so broad as to cover every single
digital reproduction once a digital file has been purchased.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?68
         – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
No, because any harm to the rights holder is minimal; it is being done for private purposes,
and the service is already licensed, i.e., payment is already being made. Users should not be
penalised for doing that which is prudent and a natural part of the digital environment, for
example, backing up their private collections of material. Different regimes mean that there
cannot be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to this issue.



66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
The biggest problem with levies on online services is that not all users will be using online
services for the storage/back up of copyright material. It would be unfair to force a researcher
to pay levies for copyright works when the only reason they need to use the service is to store
and back up their own copyright works. This makes an unfair balance in the regime and
penalises copyright owners storing their own works.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?69
     YES – Please explain
In those countries where levies apply, it would be useful because people who did not want to
be subject to levies could decide whether or not they choose to pay them. A corporate entity
would also be able to challenge being charged for a levy by mistake.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

     V.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers

authors or performers to producers71 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 72. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE73 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has

   See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

                                                                                                      44
consulted broadly on this text 74. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose75. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure76. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO – Please explain

     NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
We believe any legislation dealing with intermediaries on the Internet has to be extremely
well thought through and defined appropriately. In the UK, poor drafting of some legislation
meant that organisations like schools, archives, libraries and universities were essentially
defined as intermediaries in the same way as internet service providers. We believe it very
important that organisation with a public policy function such as a library or educational
establishment should NOT be treated as an intermediary of any description and that protection
is provided for such bodies from secondary liability due to copyright infringement by their
patrons.
77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
     YES – Please explain

74
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
75
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
76
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           45

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Suspicion continues to grow around private copying by citizens which can lead to invasions
of privacy by companies whose business model is to ‘troll’ for copyright infringement,
causing distress to innocent citizens. This is coupled with the fact that many negotiations at a
trade level (such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership 77) are still being
conducted in secret when they involve intellectual property issues and enforcement which
impact on citizens’ liberties. There is a concern that the EU will concede various rights,
protections and exceptions in order to advance trade negotiations.

      VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
     YES
     NO
The EU should not attempt to introduce a single Title or a Regulation for copyright. As far as
protection of copyright is concerned the mechanism of Directives serves well enough,
however achieving a more even national treatment within the Single Market would be best
achieved by the EU using Directives to establish a floor of minimum norms for copyright
limitations and exceptions throughout the Single Market. This would ensure that Member
States must implement limitations and exceptions at the same minimum level, but also
ensures they retain their existing autonomy to offer additional exceptions or to expand the
scope of exceptions at national level beyond the minimum as appropriate to their national
needs.

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
As noted earlier, we believe that knowingly making false claims of copyright ownership,
unjustified demands on third parties to take out licences when there is no evidence that they
are infringing copyright, and unjustified threats of infringement should be made offences.
This is the case for other forms of intellectual property such as registered trade marks and
patents, and acts as a deterrent to this type of behaviour.
Currently, universities, public libraries and schools subscribe to large amounts of electronic
content, via hundreds of contracts. It is NOT copyright that dictates how such content can be
used in the digital world, but contracts.
Every contract has different terms and conditions that have to be complied with in order not to
be in breach of the agreement. Just as it was not possible to have a separate agreement for
every book on a shelf, it is not possible for the thousands of libraries across Europe to
negotiate each contract to guarantee what their users can do with the large amounts of
electronic content now available for purchase. Across the library sector, we do not have the
resource or legal expertise required to do this.
Irrespective of the many varying terms of contracts, and the large number of contracts
libraries have to negotiate, all libraries, students, researchers and citizens should have
certainty around what they can always do with the electronic contents they have purchased or
to which they have legal access.
Protection of the copyright exceptions from override by contract already exists in Irish,
Portuguese and Belgian copyright law, and in proposals to change UK law. It is therefore
essential that across Europe, people know that as a bare minimum they can apply the norms of
copyright exceptions to lawfully accessible content. Without this, every librarian, student,
researcher and citizen across Europe is expected to be an expert in contract law, and have read
and understood all the terms and conditions for every eBook or e-database they access
through a library.
Technical protection measures (TPMs) should also be addressed, particularly when they
prevent libraries from making accessible copies available to persons with disabilities. The EU
should permit the breaking of TPMs in certain circumstances; the fact that it is currently a
criminal offence to do so is not prudent nor useful in the digital age when the making of an
accessible copy from a print text could be done under an exception to copyright.
