   II.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller - therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe"12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.

                                                                                                6
 Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
 to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
 are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
 services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
 to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is
 available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
 only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
 Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
 This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
 the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
 between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
 at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission -
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available - and
at the users' end - e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.




16 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17 Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection

of computer programs.
18 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of

databases.
19 Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called "neighbouring rights" in,

respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors' content protected by copyright is
referred to as a "work" or "works", while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as "other subject
matter".
20 The right to "authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and

in any form, in whole or in part" (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21 The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise

or prohibit the making available to the public "on demand" (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 9
1.       The act of "making available"
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
"making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online
service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the "making available" right irt cross-border situations - i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders - sufficiently clear?
• YES
• NO - Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)
Country of origin approach


• NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief4)?
• YES - Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed




• NO


22 See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (ĽOréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23 The objective of implementing a "country of origin" approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that

must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24 Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent

an infringement of his/her right.

 • NO OPINION

 2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
 Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
 law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
 transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
 licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
 persons/entities.

 10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
 rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
 create problems for you?
 • YES - Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
 problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
 to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.       Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
• YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

• NO - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public - or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Het internet bestaat biį de gratie van hyperlinks. Het verschaft internauten een wegwijzer
naar informatie en dient dan ook beschermd te worden op basis van het grondrecht van
toegang tot informatie (zoals beschermd door art. 10 EVRM). Het kan dan ook niet dat het
louter linken naar auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal ook als een auteursrechtelijk
relevante handeling wordt gekwalificeerd. Indien het Hof van Justitie toch in die zin zou
oordelen dan dient het linken onder een auteursrechtelijke uitzondering te vallen.
Diezelfde opmerking kan ook worden gemaakt voor het embedden van beschermd
materiaal op sociale media zoals bvb Pinterest. Ook het embedden dient als een niet
auteursrechtelijk relevante handeling te worden beschouwd, minstens te worden toegelaten
op       basis       van      een        uitzondering    op       het      auteursrecht.

a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache

subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
• YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why




O NO — Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

4.         Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can


27 See   also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                12
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it - this is often referred to as
the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
• YES - Please explain by giving examples




• NO
• NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]




C.       Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?

28 In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second­

hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder's consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
296)'
   For example, it does not affect "domestic" works - i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30 On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25

October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                              13
O YES
• NO
• NO OPINION


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Het klaren van rechten zou veel efficiënter kunnen verlopen. Nu worden veel werken door
erfgoedinstellingen niet ontsloten omdat de juiste rechthebbenden vaak moeilijk of niet
kunnen worden gevonden. Een dergelijk systeem zou onmiddellijk alle noodzakelijke
informatie beschikbaar kunnen stellen. Het is dienaangaande bovendien belangrijk dat ook
de transfer van rechten wordt geregistreerd. Deze registratie zou het probleem van
toekomstige                   verweesde                  werken                 kunnen
oplossen



17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Geen



18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
De vraag stelt zich of rechthebbenden hiervoor veel aanmoedigingen moeten krijgen. Een
dergelijk systeem bestaat ook in het kader van andere intellectuele eigendomsrechten (zoals
merken, patenten, modellen etc.) waarbij de rechthebbenden hiertoe gewoonweg verplicht
worden zonder het verkrijgen van enige aanmoediging.
Anderzijds hebben rechthebbenden hier alleen maar voordelen bij. Zij zullen immers
sneller kunnen gevonden worden waardoor hun inkomsten voor gebruik potentieel kunnen
stijgen.
Een mogelijke stimulans - gekoppeld weliswaar aan een mindèr lange auteursrechtelijke
beschermingstermijn dan op vandaag (zie vraag 20) - is een verlenging van de
auteursrechtelijke beschermingstermijn door deze registratie.




D.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
'identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are



                                                                                          14
 specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
 itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
 examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
 identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
 a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
 Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
 management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
 development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types
 of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
 systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
 different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]


Het is aangewezen dat de EU, initiatieven om tot unieke identifiers te komen, zou
faciliteren. Deze identifiers zijn immers onontbeerlijk om content opzoekbaar te maken
en eenduidig te koppelen aan de hand van nieuwe internettechnologie (linked data,
semantisch web...). De EU zou desgevallend publiek-private constructies mee kunnen
helpen opzetten waarbij het wel essentieel is dat niet alleen rechthebbenden maar ook
(institutionele) gebruikers hierin opgenomen worden.
In ieder geval is het belangrijk dat databanken van identifiers vrijelijk door iedereen
kunnen geraadpleegd worden.



E.       Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

31  E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

environment?
• YES - Please explain




D NO - Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
De auteursrechtelijke beschermingstermijn is overdreven lang geworden. Voor
erfgoedinstellingen is het hierdoor vaak onmogelijk om hun collecties te ontsluiten, ook al
betreft het vaak werken die commercieel niet (meer) exploiteerbaar zijn. De meerkost om de
rechten te klaren weegt dan ook niet op tegen de voordelen van deze lange
beschermingstermijn. Deze termijn dient dus in ieder geval teruggeschroefd te worden naar
de beschermingstermijn uit de Berner Conventie van 50 jaarp.nua
Idealiter dient de beschermingstermijn in het auteursrecht even lang te zijn als in het
octrooirecht (20 jaar). Deze termijn kan eventueel verlengd worden tot de
beschermingstermijn van 50 jaar p.m.a. op voorwaarde dat de auteursrechthebbenden zijn
werk laat registeren (zie vraag 17-18). Hierdoor zullen veel werken sneller in het publiek
domein vallen en enkel de economisch interessante werken beschermd blijven. De EU
wordt dan ook gevraagd dit op internationaal vlak, in het kader van een mogelijke
herziening van de Berner Conventie, bespreekbaar te maken.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of

36 Plus Directive 96/9ÆC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37 Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of

the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38 Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                                                                                           16
 the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
 States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
 worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
 for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
 effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The mam question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
• YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases
Door het optioneel houden vaņ de uitzonderingen is van een harmonisatie van het
auteursrecht binnen de EU (op het vlak van de uitzonderingen) geen sprake. Het is voor

• NO - Please explain


40 Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and

related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work - for instance a novel - is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree offlexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 0 YES - Please explain why


Het is absoluut noodzakelijk dat uitzonderingen op het auteursrecht op een meer flexibele
wijze kunnen worden toegepast De uitzonderingen zijn immers niet geformuleerd in een
technologie neutrale manier en kunnen dan ook niet worden toegepast op onbekende
gebruiksvormen ten tijde van de redactie van de uitzondering. Technologische evoluties
volgen zich echter zo snel op dat vaak niet kan worden gewacht op de wetgever om
bestaande uitzonderingen hieraan aan te passen. Hierdoor komt beschermd materiaal ook

open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

Een open norm, zoals een fair use uitzondering is noodzakelijk. Deze open norm dient te

gebruiken die in se van niet-commerciële aard zijn en de belangen van de rechthebbenden
nauwelijks schaden toelaten. Minstens dient, in afwijking van de rechtspraak van het Hof
van Justitie, worden gesteld dat uitzonderingen niet op een restrictieve manier moeten
worden uitgelegd, zodat zij naar analogie door de nationale rechtscolleges op gelijkaardige

Α.           Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.           Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) - the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of



41 Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
42 Article 5(3 )n of Directive 2001/29.
43 Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.


                                                                                           20
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
0 YES - Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
Het is soms onduidelijk voor erfgoedinstellingen (dus niet enkel bibliotheken en archieven)
wanneer er sprake is van preserveringsdoeleinden in de betekenis van de uitzondering.
Volgens art 22 §1 8° van de Belgische Auteurswet is het aantal reproducties beperkt in
functie van en gerechtvaardigd door het voor de bewaring van het culturele en
wetenschappelijke patrimonium gestelde doei Voor archieven is het essentieel dat zij altijd
digitale preserveringskopieën mogen nemen en dit voor alle mogelijke
archiveringsdoeleinden
Indien digitale werken door technische voorzieningen (zoals kopieerbeveiligingen) worden
beschermd dan moet het met toepassing van de preserveringsuitzondering mogelijk zijn om
deze technische voorziening te omzeilen.
Tot slot dient de preserveringsuitzondering ook van toepassing te zijn op werken die online
beschikbaar werden gesteld. Depreseveringsuitzondering moet m.o.w. zowel op analoge als
digitale werken kunnen worden toegepast

elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular ifyou are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]

3.     E - lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

recht voor om boeken uit e-leenmodellen terug te trekken. Hierdoor zijn bibliotheken
onzeker over het lange termijn rendement van hun investeringen en van hun positie ten
aanzien van hun gebruikers.
Uitgevers weigeren om e-lenen gratis te maken voor specifieke maatschappelijke
doelgroepen (armen, sociaal zwakken). Hierdoor wordt het voor bibliotheken onmogelijk
om een specifieke opdracht te vervullen: toegang tot informatie en cultuur garanderen voor
iedereen en zorgen voor een meer sociale en democratische kennismaatschappij.

4.       Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted)45.

40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(Le. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
• YES - Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
Vooreerst is het belangrijk om te onderlijnen dať massadigitalisering meer is dan wat de

http://ec.europa.eu/internal market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index en.htm.
45 France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°

2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.           Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their

States level.

 D.          Disabilities
 Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
 a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
 implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
 launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
 disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
 facilitating their distribution across the European Union)49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States' implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across

landen de distributie van boeken in aangepast leesformaat beperkt is tot mensen met een
visuele beperking en niet open staat voor mensen met een andere leesbeperking zoals
dyslexie. Dit is bijvoorbeeld het geval zowel in Frankrijk als in Duitsland. Wat eigenlijk in
tegenspraak is met het Europese MOU (2010) en het internationale WIPO-verdrag (2013).
Binnen België leidt dit zelfs tot het bizarre gegeven dat de Franstalige Daisy-luisterboeken
van de Franstalige bibliotheek (ligue Braille) niet beschikbaar zijn voor personen met
dyslexie, zowel voor de Nederlandstaligen als de Franstaligen in België, maar dat
anderzijds de Nederlandstalige Daisy-luisterboeken van de Vlaamse luisterpuntbibliotheek

wordt, zodat zowel online distributie als distributie op een drager (Daisy-cd, braille-print)

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
ETIN exists already two years but didn't realise concrete results for the target groups. The
ETIN-project for cross-border lending of accessible materials for prinţ disabled persons is
important, but can only be successful if the EU supports it by project money and give
support to a first step in the project in which cross-border lending between countries with
the samé language becomes possible.




                                                                                          30
 E.      Text and data mining
 Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
 increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
 amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
 of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
 order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe"52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
                                                                                           32
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions54.

  IV.          Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,

sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial pumose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient

infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection ofprivate life and protection ofpersonal data?

 Neen, er is een onevenwicht ten voordele van de rechthebbenden. Slachtoffers van
 inbreuken op intellectuele eigendomsrechten krijgen meer mogelijkheden dan slachtoffers
 van andere inbreuken (zoals verkeersongevallen, milieuongevallen etc.). Bovendien wordt
 vaak te weinig rekening gehouden in dit alles met de bescherming van de persoonlijke
 levenssfeer.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
• YES

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
