                             Public Consultation
                   on the review of the EU copyright rules







Please identify yourself:





Name:

ELRA, European Language Resources Association asbl
Association sans but lucratif
52, rue Charles Martel,  L-2134, Luxembourg
Secrétariat: 9 Rue des Cordelières, 75013 Paris
Contact: choukri@elda.org


The mission of the Association is to promote language resources  (henceforth
LRs) and evaluation for the Human Language Technology (HLT) sector  in  all
their forms and all their uses, in a  European  context.  Consequently  the
goals are  :  to  coordinate  and  carry  out  identification,  production,
validation, distribution, standardization of LRs, as well  as  support  for
evaluation  of  systems,  products,  tools,  etc.  -  related  to  language
resources. Other resources will be considered as well  if  developments  of
the field make this desirable: e.g.  multimedia  resources  both  with  and
without language.


Language Resources are datasets comprising textual, audio,  images,  videos,
etc. required  for  the  development  of  technologies  such  as  Automated
Translation, search engine, information retrieval, data mining, Speech  and
speaker recognition, automatic summarization, etc.





ELRA represent the major players within  the  Human  Language  Technologies,
worldwide.

   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[1].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[2] should significantly facilitate the delivery of  multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for   online   services[3];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue  “Licences  for  Europe”[4]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[5].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[6].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[7]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)





Europe  as  a  multilingual  multicultural  space  has  all  the   potential
strengths to act as  world  leader  on  Information  technologies  involving
languages  and  other  modalities.  Such  technologies  require   tremendous
research efforts mostly based on the use, as a  key  component,  of  massive
amounts  of  language  data  to  achieve  performance  leading   to   usable
applications. Human Language Technologies are the crucial factor to  address
the digital barrier we notice today across Europe  that  prevents  seriously
the development of cross-countries and cross-borders economies.





The underlying research needs access to  language  material  its  structures
rather than its content. For  instance  Machine  Translation  requires  huge
amount of “aligned texts” (sentences with  the  same  meaning)  but  do  not
“care” about the meaning itself.  Automatic  Transcriptions  of  Broadcasted
news require  audio-visual  content  with  associated  orthographic  (and/or
phonetic annotations) to learn the acoustic parameters needed by the  speech
recognition systems.





Such language material should be available  for  all  the  languages  to  be
automatically processed which makes it impossible for small  research  teams
to access data across the languages  and  the  legal  barriers  we  have  in
Europe.





The type of “content” concerned are mostly  audio-visual  content  including
recording with  sign  languages,  textual  data  from   e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, etc. but such sources are not essential  for  their
content but rather the language descriptions used.





Let us highlight this concept with an example.  Let  us  take  an  important
Czech Lab involved in Automation of  translations  between  Czech,  Slovene,
and Danish. In order to produce the necessary training data,  they  have  to
negotiate licenses under three different jurisdictions  (assuming  that  the
rights-owners are identified and willing to grant them a license).





Even if active “collecting societies” exist (mostly at  a  national  level),
they never manage use-rights as needed by the research community  (which  is
completely   different   from   the   traditional   re-dissemination,    re-
broadcasting, etc. ;), these cases are never foreseen by such societies.





In all cases, negotiating with the right owners of  each  dataset  across  a
large number of unclear legal regimes makes it impossible for  most  of  the
European active players, not to mention  the  small  research  teams.   Such
limitation puts the European players behind  their  “competitors”  operating
under the fair use doctrine of copyrighted works.

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).





The issue is mostly about copyright and data licensing.


ELRA acts as the middle-man  between  data  providers  and  data-users  (the
research  and  development  communities).  As  part  of  its  mission,  ELRA
catalogues and gives access to the largest inventory of  Language  Resources
in Europe. In order to  do  so,  ELRA  signed  more  than  300  distribution
agreements with right-holders and grants about 100  licenses  every  quarter
since 1996. Negotiating a distribution agreement is always a costly  effort;
it is a nightmare when it is a cross boarder one given the  different  legal
systems. It is even worst when negotiating licenses to be  granted  by  ELRA
to research labs that hardly  understand  the  legal  implications  of  such
instruments and why they are required in a research environment.


Of course to be able to provide  the  necessary  resources,  often  free  of
charge, requires a very costly  effort  to  identify  and  clear  the  legal
status of the data, rendering this task not viable and hard to sustain as  a
business case.





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]





ELRA acts  on  behalf  of  right-holders  of  language  resources  to  grant
licenses to technology developers and research institutions. We grant  about
100 licenses every quarter.





We estimate that  less  than  20%  of  the  “used”  language  resources  are
licensed by the user and hence used legally. We estimate that  over  80%  of
the resources used by technology developers and research  labs,  as  primary
data, are infringing some rights.





Parts of these requests that cannot be filled  by  organizations  like  ELRA
because of the legal issues involved.


Examples: Textual data from newspapers, audio-visual data from  broadcasters
(news, talk shows), etc.





……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


Part of these suggestions have been discussed with the WG4  of  “EC-Licences
for Europe”.





We suggest first to distinguish the use of Language Resources  for  research
activities  (in  particular  by  not-for-profit  organizations)   from   the
commercial use of produced technologies.





(a) For the research community, an important action should be to  adapt  the
European rules to the fair use doctrine  as  applicable  in  many  competing
countries (e.g. USA, CANADA, Israel, etc.).


(b) All publicly funded research should be required  to  make  its  produced
resources available through trustable channels  (similar  to  what  the  USA
National Science Foundation issued in 2011 about “dissemination and  sharing
of research results through the required  inclusion  of  a  data  management
plan”.


(c) Ensure that more Public sector resources are included in the  EU  Public
sector initiative (for instance audio-visual data from broadcasters).











   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





For specific types of resources, privacy and/or  ethics,  may  justify  some
territorial limitations (often for dealing with partners  from  outside  the
EU).





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


See question 5 above.





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain





In order to boost the research activities on  Human  Language  Technologies,
it is essential that access to massive amount of data is  made  easier  than
today, for all languages and related resources within Europe. The only cost-
effective way is to address  the  fair  use  exception  at  the  legislative
level. Such approach will not hinder the assets of right-holders  that  will
still have to license their data for the commercial  use  of  the  developed
technologies. More indications on section 4 above.





……………………………………………………………………………………………….


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established  by  Directive  2001/29/EC[8]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection  of  software[9]
and databases[10].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[11] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[12],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[13].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[14]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


NOT APPLICABLE TO OUR ACTIVITIES.




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[15])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed





Harmonization of EU rules is  an  essential  step  towards  boosting  cross-
country trade.





……………………………………………………………………………………………….





Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


……………………………………………………………………………………….





NOT APPLICABLE TO OUR ACTIVITIES.


Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[16]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[17] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)





Hyperlinks (and references in general) are the basis of Internet  and  refer
to URLs that could be accessed by other means and not  necessarily  directly
to content. As long as  such  links  do  not  provide  passwords  and  other
private credentials, it should not be limited. It is the duty of the  right-
holder to protect its assets and prevent unwanted linked.







  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)








Such use is already covered by the  art. 5.1 of the Directive 2001/29/EC.


Viewing and cashing do not  mean  re-distribution  and  sharing  with  third
parties.





Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[18].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[19].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ NO OPINION


NOT APPLICABLE IN OUR ACTIVITIES





  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


Very hard to assess, may  create  unfair  competition  between  distribution
agencies and their customers (that may decide to resell the digital  content
once the “processing” of such data is  over).  Our  “content”  is  different
from MP3 and other digital contents and is  often  duplicable/sharable.  The
new trend of the use of permissive license (like  Creative  Commons)  allows
doing such redistribution without referring to the right holder.





Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[20]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[21].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


The creation of a registration system would allow an easy identification  of
right holders and facilitate clearance of rights. The remaining question  is
how to license  such  data  even  if  the  owner  is  identified.  ELRA,  in
partnership with over  12  major  organizations  in  the  field  of  Natural
Language Processing (the NLP12)  is  launching  a  registration  system  for
Language Resources (the International  Standard  Language  Resource  Number)
but this will not solve the licensing  problems  (and  the  costs  of  legal
negotiations).








  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]





This approach will not solve the problem but at least will  make  it  easier
to find the party to negotiate with. Negotiations will  remain;  the  number
of possible  jurisdictions  under  which  to  negotiate  the  licenses  will
continue to be a heavy cost for many players.








  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





None,  as  long  as  this  is  not  an  additional  layer  of  the  existing
instruments.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


If the registered “content” is of great value,  registration  will  give  it
more visibility but other incentives should be established.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[22], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[23]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[24]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[25] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


In some sectors (like Language Resources),  major  consortia  of  scientific
societies   are   establishing   their   own   identifiers   that   can   be
boosted/endorsed by the EU. See www.islrn.org for details.





EU should ensure that all EU funded  projects  adopt  such  identifiers  and
support them.








Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[26]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


The  Copyright  duration  is  not  THE  Issue.  Though  the  long   duration
(applicable to various digital objects) harms the  development  of  language
technologies in Europe, shortening it would not solve the access problem  to
recent datasets to model the  language  as  it  is  used  today.  It  is  as
important  to  produce  technologies  that  translate   early   1900   texts
(copyright expired) as ones that translate the newspapers of yesterday.





  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[27].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[28].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[29], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[30],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[31].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


For ELRA that needs to negotiate with its  providers  and  its  “users”  all
over Europe, the  differences  in  national  legislations  are  the  biggest
hurdles to tackle. The different optional exceptions or limitations  to  the
right of  reproduction  of  copyrighted  works  contribute  to  render  this
impossible outside costly explicit licensing context.





  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases





There is clearly a strong need for the harmonization of such exceptions  for
research purposes to ensure that all EU (official  &  non-official/minority)
languages are included in the community  research  agenda.  Such  exceptions
should be applicable to (multi)media  resources  useful  to  carry  research
activities.



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]





A wide exception for research  purposes  should  be  added,  concerning  all
types of digital contents.








……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why





Legal jurisdictions with the fair use doctrine have  shown  more  efficiency
and  economic  growth  (USA,  South-Korea,  Israel,  Singapore,  etc.).  The
absence  of  such  “exceptions”  (for  fair  use,  research  purposes)  will
continue to constitute a major obstacle for European R&D.


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]





The best approach would be a built-in doctrine of fair use within a  new  EU
copyright law.


There is a clear advantage of such approach  in  boosting  EU  research  and
innovation while cutting all the licensing /negotiation costs.





  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to





Yes as long as  some  of  the  current  exceptions  are  based  on  national
jurisdictions that may even encourage organizations to establish  affiliates
in the right country to benefit for the current  flexibility  (for  instance
establishing a “legal” entity in  the  USA  to  cover  acquisition  of  such
resources for research purposes under USA copyright law).








  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]




Such limitations and exceptions will continue to distort competition  within
the EU  and  their  impacts  is  hard  to  assess,  that  is  why  a  strong
harmonization should be the answer  to  the  cross-border  effect  with  the
flexibility mentioned above.








Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[32] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[33].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[34].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?




NOT APPLICABLE IN OUR ACTIVITY




29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]




The   archiving   houses   (such    as    National    libraries,    national
broadcasters/audio-visual  archiving  houses  where  it  exist)  should   be
allowed/required to  make  available  the  archived  material  for  research
purposes, without the authorization of right-holders.





Archiving houses should be required to act as “preservation” houses  in  the
event that access  to    original  sources  is  discontinued  and  the  data
becoming “orphan” or uncopyrighted.









  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]




There should be a specific  exception  that  requires  archiving  houses  to
offer full access to the material for research purposes.





  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?




For research purposes, some of the existing  non-commercial  infrastructures
(i.e. ELRA) should be supported as they  play  a  “public”  role  in  making
available (often for free) resources that are  essential  for  the  European
R&D activities.


Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]




Negotiating “distribution/sharing” agreements with rights holders is  ELRA’s
core mission and daily activity. Despite our efforts in  designing  a  clear
and  simple  licensing  template,  each  agreement  is  very  specific.  Our
agreements with the  right-holders  aim  at  granting  irrevocable/perpetual
right, nonexclusive licenses to use the data.





The major problems are related  to  the  accurate  identification  of  right
holders. Very often the “pretending” rights holders do not have  all  rights
necessary to enter into such distribution agreement (e.g.  translated  texts
from copyright sources for which no rights have been granted).


Another problem is when the resources consist  of  a  package  or  a  bundle
composed of datasets from different  sources  and  different  jurisdictions.
The agreement has to be multilateral and accounts for  several  jurisdiction
systems.





Very often the “resource” to be licensed is  derived  from  various  sources
for which the “right-holder does not  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the
rights status of their derived works and hence cannot sublicense it.






  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]




Ensure the exceptions mentioned above  are  taken  into  a  new  legislative
work.


Enforce the use of trustable agencies for  resources  produced  with  public
funding for their distribution with the adoption  of  a  permissive  license
(e.g. Creative Commons).




  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]




Currently several countries (USA, South-Korea, etc.) have adopted  fair  use
doctrines that boost their R&D activities and led to the  emergence  of  ICT
world champions.








  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[35].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[36].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


Most of the sources to be digitalized are still  copyrighted  and  any  mass
digitalization project should consider the  users’  access  as  the  counter
part of public  funding.  The  community  has  some  access  to  digitalized
resources (e.g. in France datasets of “old” press (-1900)  provided  by  the
BNF) but these hardly reflect today’s usage of language.





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain


These “other” types of resources are  the  core  datasets  used  by  current
technologies (speech to speech translations,  automatic  transcriptions/sub-
titling, identification of speakers, topics, scenes in  multimedia  streams,
etc.). Such resources reflect the current usage of the languages and  should
be primarily covered by all the  exceptions  listed  above.  Some  of  these
should even go under the PSI directive.


Currently  research  and  development  of  technologies  have  to  rely   on
negotiated agreements with several broadcasters. Very  few  (e.g.  BBC)  are
licensing their data under permissive licenses such as Creative Commons.





Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[37]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


The exception regarding the use for education purposes  is  widely  accepted
though there is a very narrow implementation  amongst  Member  States.  Some
Member States have their own  regulations  making  the  copyright  Directive
almost meaningless.





  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




It is important to have a unique and clear  educational  exception    across
all Member States.







  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]




In some Member states there is an explicit  “collective”  agreement  between
educational institutions  and  publishers  at  national  level  (in  several
countries, universities pay a lump  sum  or  a  fee  per  student  to  allow
reproduction and online uses of works for teaching purposes).


These illustrate the case-by-case solutions on a  local/national  basis  and
the inconsistency of use of  works  across  Member  States  for  educational
purposes.







  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]


The legislative solution is definitely needed to lower  the  burden  on  the
educational  centers.  A  harmonization  at  the  EU  level   is   essential
(including for cross-border  uses).  All  kinds  of  works  should  be  made
available for educational purposes  without  restriction;  the  compensation
model should be addressed at  the  national/European  levels  (such  as  tax
deductions for copyright  owners  instead  of  compensations  paid  by  each
institution). Education is often combined  with  research  (basic  research)
and hence such use should be included as well.




  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[38]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


Most of the successful research activities are carried out in consortia  and
at the European level (FP7, H20202 now, etc.). Though consortium  agreements
manage the relationship between members, difference  in  the  interpretation
of the research  exception  in  different  member  states  leads  to  strong
uncertainty  regarding  the  applicable  rules  of   sharing   the   project
background and foreground. In particular this  is  made  more  complex  when
partners are located in countries outside the EU that apply the doctrine  of
fair use.


Very often the data sharing is governed by explicit  licenses  that  require
legal advice and takes time, making  it  harder  for  the  small  teams  and
giving serious competitive advantage to big labs or  those  located  in  the
right place (fair use argument).


Due to the current transition period (harmonization of Copyright law  as  by
Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29  October  1993  harmonizing  the  term  of
protection of copyright and certain related rights), some works may  not  be
copyrighted in a partner state while it is  in  another  one,  causing  more
confusion.




  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




It is clear that a research exception would solve this problem.




  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

 Some members have transposed the PSI directive and offer  a  license  model
that is adopted by other players (for non-public sector data). These  remain
very isolated cases and do not address the core issue  that  is  related  to
the different jurisdictions to deal with in an EU context.


Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[39]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [40].

The Marrakesh Treaty[41] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


In our particular case, access to data such as audio-visual recordings  with
SIGN Language interpretations is as hard as the rest  of  broadcasted  data.
In order to develop automated translation systems (French  audio  to  German
Sign Language) one requires access to massive amounts of  data  from  France
and from Germany, not always exists, and if it exists not  always  available
for all the legal reasons mentioned above.





The implementation by the Member States  of  Marrakech  WIPO  Treaty  should
facilitate access of visually impaired persons to such works but  this  does
not solve the problem of an access for research purposes that would lead  to
new technologies improving  their  access  (translation,  audio-description,
etc.) and also extension to person with other disabilities.










  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

[Open question]




(a)  The need for  advances  technological  instruments  to  facilitate  the
access   (across   modalities   and   languages),   advanced   technological
implementations  that  require  access  to  existing  language  and  related
resources.


(b)  Implementation  and  extension  of  the  Marrakech  treaty   to   other
categories of users.




  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?

[Open question]


Still at the crafted solutions and case by case despite the  effort  of  big
associations (like ONCE in Spain).





Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[42] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[43].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


 Text and Data mining (including multimedia/audio-visual mining) consist  of
two stages:


(1)  A training  phase  of  the  mining  algorithms  so  as  to  assess  and
benchmark their performance and applicability.


(2) The use in real application of such deployed solution to  mine  existing
sources for research, market watch, analysis, etc.





In both cases  massive  amounts  of  data  are  essential.  To  address  the
training phase, we have to face  the  issues  elaborated  upon  in  previous
sections and related to resources availability for research purposes.





To address item 2, one should consider all the facets of  existing  sources.
Many are publicly available for browsing and search, and  hence  should  not
require any additional  agreement.  This  is  what  most  of  the  US  based
enterprises are offering their members under the  fair  use  exception  that
offers more flexibility  and  puts  the  EU  based  entities  at  a  serious
disadvantage (if such EU based entities still exist?).  In addition,  it  is
difficult to assess how  much  of  data  mining  falls  under  the  research
exception (e.g. universities collaborating with pharmacological  companies).
To allow for an easy and consistent mining approach, a license model  should
be  developed  that  allow  research  and  education  centers  to  mine  all
accessible content as by the past (instead of using pencils and  books  from
the library shelves now they use computers and university servers;  when  it
comes to the use of the content provider servers and facilities,  a  special
agreement should be negotiated and a model license  should  be  proposed  by
the EU).





  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]




See answers above (1 and 2 of 53).



  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

Text and data mining should be part of the research agenda  and  hence  fall
under the recommended exception elaborated upon in previous questions.


Access to publicly available sources (open web, (those for instance  indexed
by the major search engines) should be allowed without any additional  legal
work. The finding should be sharable as “citations” that would not  infringe
any copyright.





  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]


As indicated above publicly accessible sources  should  be  minable  without
any  additional  burden.  The  protected  data   (requiring   subscriptions,
passwords, etc.) should allow doing so within  the  subscription  agreement.
This should a faire win-win between Publisher/right-holders and the users.





  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]





The current approach based on licenses requires  multi-national  negotiation
of multiple and separate licenses makes the whole  task  cost-intensive  and
restricted to large  labs  with  the  right  (costly)  legal  support.  Such
approach prevents text & data mining  and  the  economic  growth  that  such
innovative work could generate.





The other barrier has to do with  privacy  and  ethics.  While  this  is  an
important  EU  concern,  the  research  community  should  be  offered  more
flexibility in particular when  deciding  at  what  stage  anonymisation  is
required.











User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[44]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licenses concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[45].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


Most of the language resources used within  the  Human  Language  Technology
community are derived from  pre-existing  works  (journalist  texts,  audio-
visual streams, dictionaries and lexica).  Most  of  the  associated  rights
have to be cleared first before deriving added-value usable resources.  This
requires costly efforts to ensure that such re-use  is  legally  authorized.
Again the identification of right-holders and negotiating put EU players  at
a severe disadvantage compared to other countries.





  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?


€ YES – Please explain


The work created by us or our  providers,  assuming  the  background/primary
data has been legally cleared, is licensed to third parties. We  do  account
for the requirements of  the  “background”  right-owners  and  transfer  all
their requirements as obligations to the licensee of the data. Such  license
is always debated through lengthy negotiations. This  impacts  our  capacity
to act efficiently compared to our competitors outside EU.














  60. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
      holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to be  remunerated
      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


€ YES – Please explain


Yes and this is part of the lengthy negotiations mentioned above,  that  are
often necessary even for resources that do not generate revenues.








  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]

  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

As indicated above (1) a strong change  on  the  current  copyright  law  to
introduce a doctrine of fair use for research purposes, applied  in  all  EU
countries and (2) solve the problem of “derived resources” to allow for  the
recombination of existing resources with added-value.





  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

 III. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[46]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[47][48].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[49]  in
      the digital environment?

€ NO OPINION


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[50]

€  NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[51]

€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[52].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?




€ NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]

  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[53] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[54]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

We should distinguish scientific work  from  the  rest.  Today’s  scientific
publications are often copyrighted by the publishers.  The  author  of  such
work should be allowed to  publish  it  wherever  it  is  appropriate  (open
access archives, personal web-page, etc.). The “fame” obtained is  the  sole
remuneration of the authors.





For the rest relationship between authors  and  publishers  as  governed  by
current  copyright  laws   should   be   updated   to   consider   the   new
distribution/Access channels and the fair redistribution of revenues.





  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain


There is a need to revise the  relationship  between  scientific  publishers
and the authors in the light of new trends of open access.





  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

A thorough analysis of the current environment of  publications  and  beyond
that copyrighted material access should be conducted.





……………………………………………………………………………………………….


   V. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[55] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[56].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[57]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[58].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


(1) Research purposes  should  be  allowed  under  the  exception  described
above.


(2) For commercial use and the  corresponding  infringements,  fairness  and
equity should be the rule. It seems that major  international  /big  players
do not care about this aspect.





  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]




 Intermediaries should remain non-liable otherwise the  cost  of  the  whole
process will be so high that it may not be viable.








  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?




€ NO – Please explain


Current framework is unbalance  across  rights  and  across  countries.   In
addition to the important copyright,  privacy/protection  of  private  life,
and protection of personal data, there should be a right to fair use.





  VI. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


  As  long  as  the  to-be-established  single  “EU  Copyright   Title”   is
consistently  transposed  by  the  Member  states  and  accounts   for   all
requirements (e.g. fair use) elaborated upon in previous sections.




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


[Open question]


This depends on the EU modus operandi. In order to prevent losing ground  to
competitors located outside the EU, it is essential and urgent  to  act,  as
short term  objective  and  challenge,  on  the  adoption  of  the  research
exception indicated above.


 VII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[11] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[12] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[13] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[14] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[15] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
[16]   Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)  and C-
279/13 (C More entertainment).
[17]  Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See

cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.
[18] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[19] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[20] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[21] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[22] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

[27] Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases;  Directive
2009/24/EC on the legal  protection  of  computer  programs,  and  Directive
92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

(1996).
[29] Other than the grandfathering of the  exceptions  of  minor  importance
for analogue uses existing in Member States  at  the  time  of  adoption  of
Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
[30] With  the  exception  of  certain  limitations:  (i)  in  the  Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[31] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[36] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

[44] A typical example could be the “kitchen”  or  “wedding”  video  (adding
one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
