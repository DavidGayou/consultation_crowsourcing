Response of the association “CÍRCULO D’AUTOR- Centro de Estudos de Direito de Autor e
Conexos” to the European Commission consultation on the review of the EU Copyright Rules



NAME: Círculo d’Autor - Centro de Estudos de Direito de Autor e Conexos” (Portuguese
representation of “ALAI“ - ASSOCIATION LITTÉRAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE INTERNATIONALE)

TYPE OF RESPONDENT: Association mostly devoted to the study of Copyright and Neighbouring
Rights

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS:

Círculo d’Autor – Centro de Estudos de Direito de Autor e Conexos is a civil association without
commercial purposes, national wide, of professional, scientific and technical nature, strictly
independent from any political or economical entity or force, which aims at promoting the study,
development, discussion and divulgating issues of Intellectual Property, altogether, but especially
focused on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights.

The association ensures the Portuguese representation of Association Littéraire et Artistique
Internationale (ALAI), founded in 1878 under the presidency of Victor Hugo, which promoted the
Bern Convention, and is creditor of an officially acknowledged authority, publishing works, on a
regular basis, which form an indispensable tool for the study of current evolution in Copyright.

Círculo d’Autor is currently involved in projects which aim to encompass the Countries which
constitute the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) in a number of common
initiatives and expertise training.

The Members of Círculo d’Autor are deeply concerned with the future evolution of Copyright in the
context of the Digital Agenda.

Sharing with the European Commission the undeniable intent of contributing to streamline licensing
procedures and ensuring that Copyright and Neighbouring Rights are not to be regarded as obstacles
to the free circulation of goods and services and the development of European Culture, we fear that
so much reformative pressure, as seems to be apparent from the Commission Consultation
Document might imply some degree of revolutionary solutions being imposed upon the functioning
of the market, thus endangering some currently satisfactory business models, which allow a
balanced distribution of income between right holders/ producers of cultural goods and services, on
one hand, and the general users, on the other.

Copyright and Neighbouring Rights has became a rather fundamental form of protecting immaterial
property, and the only possible defence against the multiple challenges which the Information
Society revolution has brought, along with a tremendous empowerment of the world population,
now granted access to a digital version of virtually all the Creations ever made by Human Civilization
throughout the History.

Internet is the new Gutemberg’s revolution, and it was exactly because of the invention of the press
that Copyright was invented, as a privilege bestowed upon editors, first, and only later granted to


                                               1
authors. Therefore, we need to discover a process of reinforcing Copyright and the Neighbouring
Rights the same way our Elders did, when they intellectually apprehended the need of Copyright.

New challenges demand new solutions, but there will always be a need to incentivize and reward
intellectual work, as well as to preserve the freedom of mind, which is necessary for creators to
decide when and what to create, for whom and at which price or any other form of consideration.

Europe is a multicultural combination of traditions, an immensely rich historical heritage. It is simply
impossible – and extremely undesirable - to shape all the different European Cultures into one single
blend. The richness of European Culture lies in its multiple shapes and territorial diversity. This is
precisely what makes it unique. Tastes are very different from Member State to Member State and
sometimes within the same Member State, across the different regions, traditions and cultures.

The market of Culture doesn’t respond to the economic rules which may function well in other
markets: it draws its essence from the different shades of beauty and discrete notions of perfection
which populate the Old Continent.

Any future Copyright reform must bear in mind the need to preserve territoriality as well as the place
where the protection is sought, in the legal tradition of the Bern Convention. Any other solution
would undoubtedly tend to privilege some Member States in relation to others and enable forum
shopping as well as a competition in terms of quality of protection granted.

Any new licensing solutions or streamline procedures will need to consider the rights holder
interests, in first place, because without rights holder there would be no more art, literature or
science to be enjoyed, no more creation or entrepreneurial investment to share such creativity with
Society.

The extraordinarily enlarged Community of users has been offered a tremendously powerful
platform for accessing cultural works and services, but it must be taught to use it wisely, namely, to
cherish the value of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights, for it is absolutely clear that nothing in this
world, that is of Human creation, has been produced without the expenditure of energy, devotion,
love and emotion, and these outputs deserve their share of acknowledgement in the form of rights.

Internet has allowed every person a chance to enjoy Culture, but it mustn’t become an instrument
for the destruction of Culture. Therefore, new technical and electronic devices should develop, which
granted the creators the right to be acknowledged for any digital works or digital copies of their
works, and there is no way this can be done without fostering a World Data Basis, accessible to
everyone, through the Internet, which may return, in a few seconds, the name and address of those
which own any rights to the piece of work which one is willing to use or to “mush up” with any other
work, into a new form of cultural creation, commonly known as User Generated Content (if allowed).

As Charles Clarke once said “The answer to the machine is in the machine”. the achine is the

 We too, believe that the way forward is to devise a technical infrastructure which enables the
“potentially seamless communication of rights information about and between different kinds of
content such as text, music, film and images, by and for both computers and end users level”1 and not

                                                  2
to broaden the public use of Copyrighted works in a way that is clearly incompatible with the Three-
Steps Rule enshrined in art. 5 (5) of the Copyright Directive.

We also find that the Copyright Directive’s exceptions and main principles for Member States to
implement exceptions are clearly enough, in terms of legal flexibility, to encompass new demands
from institutions such as Libraries, Universities and Scientific Research Units as well as to allow for
the quoting of excerpts and protection to the visually impaired or hard of hearing.

We also think that in case of outstanding doubts in relation to the range of current exceptions, it
would probably be useful to issue an Interpretative Communication on the Three-Step Rule, in order
to harmonize a common interpretation and maybe introduce some flexibility in the currently allowed
exceptions, without having to introduce new ones, which would weaken the Copyright protection.

In terms of new forms of licensing, we encourage rights holders, or their representatives, to set up
online licensing mechanisms, as well as to register their works in a World Data Basis, or at least, a
European Data Basis which enables any user to quickly discover the person or persons whom to ask
for a proper license, a due diligence without which he/she shouldn’t be allowed to claim that it was
impossible to identify or locate the rights owner, and therefore the work was used without
permission. This would also lead to a general concern, on behalf of rights-holders, to register works.

At this point it is imperative that we explain that Internet has brought about a whole new
environment, in which the old conceptions of the Bern Convention, in terms of waving any
formalities for the acknowledging of Copyright, are no longer applicable: we anticipate that Registry
of Works in the above referred Data Basis will become essential for the future functioning of the
market. This will eventually tend to some sort of approach, maybe even a progressive convergence,
between Copyright and Trade Marks and Patent rights, thus reinforcing the exclusivity which already
characterizes most rights, namely those which are specifically related to the Information Society.

It is clear in our minds that the so called “right to make available”, firstly introduced in the
international Community by the 1996 WIPO Treaties, and adopted by the European Union through
the Copyright Directive, in 2001, is, by nature, an exclusive right, and shouldn’t be transformed into
any other form of right, namely an “equitable remuneration“ right, an Extended Collective License
(ECL) right or even a mandatory collective management right, more suitable for most exceptions.

We recall, on this particular subject, the conclusions of the Commission’s Working Paper, issued
along with the proposal of a Directive on the Collective Management of Copyright, rejecting these
alternative forms of management for the licensing of music works for online use, and finally
determining that mandates for administering exclusive rights should be voluntary, with the
consequence that Copyright Collecting Management Organizations would be able to aggregate
mandates from any rights holders as well as from any other Collecting Management Organizations.

This solution seems to be in line with the need to preserve exclusivity in the licensing of rights.

In relation to the exceptional cases where this exclusivity seems to be impossible to hold, such as the
case of reproduction for private use, or private copy, the charging of levies as a percentage of the
recording/streaming/reproducing devices seems to be the only acceptable solution, in case of DRM
inadequacy, namely for those situations where technical devices cannot distinguish between licit and
illicit reproduction.

                                                3
But levies are only a compensation for legal forms of reproduction, and should never be regarded as
a way to legitimate all forms of unauthorized use of works downloaded from the Internet. Such
(ab)uses should be subject to further disincentive via Notice and Action procedures, leading to
temporary suspension of Internet connections or other so called technical measures such as the
downgrade of speed.

Furthermore, the respect for Copyright is to be obtained through a proper implementation of the
Copyriht Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EU of 29.04.2004).

Lastly, regarding the issue of a possible European Copyright Title, we must insist upon the
importance of European diversity, and state, for the record, that we support harmonization through
the correct and progressively unified implementation of the existing Copyright Framework,
complemented, if necessary, by some Interpretative Communications, namely regarding the eventual
need to broaden currently existing exceptions, but we clearly don’t see any need for a European
Copyright Title.

In conclusion, we hope that the Commission will thoroughly assess the possible economic outcomes
of any measures which may endanger current forms of individual licensing, avoid adding new
exceptions, which would only weaken the strength of Copyright, and preserve the most important
principles which uphold Copyright European Framework, namely Territoriality and Exclusivity.



RESPONSE TO QUESTIONNARY (ONLY WHERE APPLICABLE)

II Rights and the Functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online services anywhere in Europe?
The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements

R: Territoriality is deeply related to Europe’s characteristic diversity and multicultural nature.

Different cultures, different societies, different social habits, different education levels lead to
inevitable differences in taste, and this is precisely what constitutes the richness of European Culture.

The national markets are differently sized, some are very small, others are huge, comparatively. This
leads to different marketing strategies on behalf of cultural industries, and any launching of new
cultural products is carefully programmed to avoid disturbing other territories where the commercial
exploitation has already started, or didn’t even begin.

Investments are very difficult to recoup, and territorial exploitation is an instrument which helps to
diversify income sources by increasing the impact of products, through a constantly renovated
novelty/surprise and consequently obtaining more attention, even by diversifying advertising
approaches according to local consumption habits.




                                                 4
As the recent Plum 2012 report2 evidenced, the total willingness to pay for subscription-based cross-
border audiovisual media services is very low (3% to 6% of this market value) “Therefore, under the
system of exclusive territorial sales of rights few cross-border services as defined in this study would
be viable and only a small proportion of the willingness to pay identified in this report would be
economic to serve. This is consistent with the current market provision. “

The study confirms that the costs of rights make the cross-border provision of services unaffordable
and predicts that maybe in the future, with ECJ ruling on satellite broadcasting as well as the
development of internet technology, economics might change and the small proportion of those who
would be willing to pay might become economic to serve, but not for the time being.

Q 7. We don’t think that there is a need for the European legislator to intervene. Imposing a cross-
border provision of services where it this need is currently lacking would be tantamount to imposing
a must offer/must carry obligation upon local distributors and to forge an economic unbalanced
situation which might lead the players to failure and loss of income, thus disrupting the current
market balance just in order to satisfy a very small audience.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorized (or not) in
digital transmissions?

R: We think there may be room for some jurisdictional clarification of concepts, but this clarification
will undoubtedly be carried out by the ECJ, when dealing with a number of requests for preliminary
rulings on the subject of 2001/29/EC Directive (Copyright Directive) such as the following, which are
bound to be decided in short term:

 PLUM Consulting, TNS Opinion and The futures company, “The economic potential of cross-border pay-
to-view and listen audiovisual media services” – final report for the European Commission, March 2012

                                                  5
The International Literary and Artistic Association (Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale –
ALAI), in its 9 March 2013 Executive Committee meeting decided to form a study group with the
mandate to analyze the subject of linking measures with regard to the communication to the public
and making available to the public rights of authors and related rights owners, as stated in article 8 of
WCT, which is commonly accepted to be the material origin of art 3/1 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

According to the results of such study, “the “making available” right encompasses all forms of on-
demand access, whether or not the access results in a retention copy. Thus, it does not matter
whether the member of the public obtains access to the work via a real-time “stream” or via the
delivery to her computer or other device of a digital copy that she subsequently “opens” in order to
see or hear the work. Moreover, “making available” as set out in WCT article 8 necessarily
encompasses not only the actual transmission of a work to members of the public, but especially the
offering to the public of the work for individualized streaming or downloading, not merely the receipt
of the stream or download.”

In a move of anticipation towards the ECJ Decision in case 466/13, which will be commented in
Section 3, hereafter, the ALAI experts have found that the decisive trace is how the access to the
work is provided, namely if it is by clicking on the hyperlink itself, or if the interested party is to
follow to the appointed page and only therein may have access to the work: “links which lead
directly to specific protected material, thereby using its unique URL, fall normally within the
framework of a copyright use” whereas “when the link does not make a specific protected material
available, but merely works as a reference to a source where it may be possible to access it and where
access to the specific work itself or otherwise protected material is not achieved” such a result is not
reached.

The difference between licit and illicit act is exclusively based in the respect for the conditions
determined by the rights holders, which renders access illegal “ if (i) the content is made available
without the author's consent, or (ii) technical protection measures have been circumvented or (iii)
the availability of the content otherwise clashes with the declared or clearly implied will of the
rightholder, being “irrelevant whether the person setting the link knew about the previous history of a
protected subject matter that makes the linking illegal” meaning that no presumption of consent
should be allowed without the legislator condoning it.

In our view, such presumption would be profoundly contrary to the spirit of the WIPO Treaties, and
shouldn’t occur, even for the accounted number of exceptions which the public interest may
demand, within the Three-Steps Principle rule, as extensively and correctly laid out by article 5 of the
Copyright Directive. Exceptions and limitations will always remain outside the border of the exclusive
right, meaning those circumstances in which the individual rights have to break before the public
interest.

In another Case, C-355/12 (Nintendo),the ECJ has also stated, in its 23.01.2014 Decision that the
Copyright Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of an ‘effective technological
measure’, for the purposes of Article 6(3) of that directive, is capable of covering technological
measures comprising, principally, equipping not only the housing system containing the protected
work, such as the videogame, with a recognition device in order to protect it against acts not


                                                 6
authorized by the holder of any copyright, but also portable equipment or consoles intended to
ensure access to those games and their use.

Furthermore, there is also a strong probability that the Court will define the exact limits of some
current exceptions, namely that specifically contained in Article 5(3)(n), when deciding the request
for a preliminary ruling from the Bundesgerichtshof (Germany) lodged on 14 March 2013 -
Technische Universität Darmstadt v Eugen Ulmer KG (Case C-117/13).

Q8: YES

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

According to Makken Fouad Makeen 3 “ It is widely accepted that digital technology may result in
blurring the boundaries between the rights of reproduction, distribution, and that of communication
to the public. It is this author’s view, however, that digital technology has clearly demonstrated the
importance of the communication to the public right, which as has been shown in this book could
replace the rights of public performance, broadcasting, cabling, and public display. Furthermore, it is
submitted that it is only a matter of time before the communication to the public right could trespass
on territories that were originally reserved for other rights. It is conceivable that withia short period
of time the communication to the public right, with its three elements as defined in this book, will
make other rights seem redundant”

From a theoretical point of view, it is not difficult to accept that this form of communication to the
public encompasses, in fact, reproduction, public performance and distribution. The alleged practical
difficulties derived from a splitting of such rights in different persons will have to be overcome by the
facilitation of voluntary mandates to publishers or Copyright Management Organizations where the
right of making available will necessarily entail the other implied faculties, if necessary by means of a
legal presumption.


3. Linking and browsing

Q. 11 The answer to this question has already been given by the ECJ in the answer to the request for
a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU from the Svea hovrätt (Sweden), made by decision of 18
September 2012, Nils Svensson, Sten Sjögren, Madelaine Sahlman, Pia Gadd v Retriever Sverige AB
(C-466/12); Other Cases where this question has also been raised are BestWater International GmbH
v Michael Mebes, Stefan Potsch (Case C-348/13) and C More Entertainment AB v Linus Sandberg
(Case C-279/13);

The first of these Cases has been decided on the last 13. February, whereas some others are already
in the stage of Advocate General’s Opinion, so it might be worth considering the judicious and careful
attention that the subject of interpreting the Copyright Directive has been getting from the Court,
before attempting to introduce any innovative solutions or changes of this framework:

                                                 7
Following a sequence of landmark decisions in relation to Hotels4, Restaurants5, Bars6 and even a
Dental Practice, 7as well as a clear definition of retransmission, attached to the idea of a second
transmission of signal by an operator different from the original8, the ECJ has further elaborated on
the notion of public involved in the concept of “communication to the public”9, and qualified
hyperlinking to a webpage where a copyrighted content is displayed as a form of making such
content available, which, nevertheless, doesn’t determine the need for a license or authorisation on
behalf of right holders.

The Court stated that “the provision, on a website, of clickable links to protected works published
without any access restrictions on another site, affords users of the first site direct access to those
works” and this amounts to an “act of communication” (§18 of C 466/12, by analogy with Hotel
owners as in Case C-306/05 SGAE [2006] ECR I-11519, paragraph 43).

It will amount to “communication to the public” whenever “ it refers to an indeterminate number of
potential recipients and implies, moreover, a fairly large number of persons (§21 of C 466/12SGAE ,
paragraphs 37 and 38, and ITV Broadcasting and Others, paragraph 32). However, if the
circumstances show that such public is not new, meaning that potential viewers are the same as
those who can have access to the initial act of communication, on account of the inexistence of any
restrictive measures, then it follows that they were already taken into account when the initial act of
communication was authorized, and, therefore, no additional licensing is required. (C 466/12, §§ 28-
31) The opposite solution should be given in case that same link circumvents any access restrictions
put in place by the site on which the protected work appears, to restrict public access to that work, or
the work is no longer available in that initial website and so the link accordingly constitutes an
intervention without which those users would not be able to access the works transmitted, then, all
those users must be deemed to be a new public, and further authorization is required for such a
communication to the public.”

Q.12. The answer to this question will be given by the Court in the forthcoming Decision of Case C-
360/13, where the Court is enquired about the limits of the notion of (i) temporary, (ii) transient or
incidental copies, as (iii) an integral and essential part of the technological process within the
meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive2001/29/EC, for the distinction will certainly bring about the
opportunity to establish the rightfulness or illicitness of downloading content from the Internet,
when such content was not made available by the rights holders or with their consent. As for
uploading copyrighted content as a form of communication to the public, there doesn’t seem to be
any reasonable doubt concerning the obvious need to obtain a proper authorization.

In the C-429/08 Football Association Premier League & Murphy [2011], the ECJ has decided that,
despite of Art. 2 (a) of the Copyright Directive extending the reproduction right to transient
fragments of the work within the memory of a Satellite decoder and on a TV Screen, Art. 5(1) of the

Copyright Directive’s exception is subject to 5 conditions: i) temporary; ii) transient or incidental; iii)
integral and essential part of technological process; iv) it’s sole purpose is to enable transmission in a
network behind third parties by an intermediary or any lawful use of the reproduced data; v) no
independent economic significance (besides the advantage derived from mere reception). The ECJ
establishes that all these 5 condition are met, in that case, so the exception to the exclusive right of
reproduction is validated for the memory of Satellite decoders and TV Screen.



4. Download to own digital content

The question of possible extension of the Principle of exhaustion to immaterial property has been
addressed by the Advocate general KOLKOTT in case C-429/08 Football Association Premier League &
Murphy [2011] in terms which didn’t receive the necessary endorsement from the ECJ, in the final
decision.

In the Decision (§ 117- 121) the Court has explained why territorial restrictions can no longer apply to
the circumstances of the case in totally different terms, never having to refer that intellectual rights
are subject to exhaustion, which would strongly enter into conflict with art. 3/3, at least in case of
the communication to the public as well as the making available right as explained in Recitals 28 and
29 of the Copyright Directive.

This means there is no exhaustion concerning ”digital” rights. Is it possible to apply the principle of
exhaustion to acts of transmission where someone acquires the property of the copy?

Art. 4(2) of the Protection of Computer Programs Directive10 states that “the first sale in the
Community of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the
distribution right within the Community of that copy, with the exception of the right to control further
rental of the program or a copy thereof.”

This means that “the exhaustion of the distribution right under Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24
concerns both tangible and intangible copies of a computer program, and hence also copies of
programs which, on the occasion of their first sale, have been downloaded from the internet onto the
first acquirer’s computer11.

In Case C-128/11, the Court decided, on the 12th of July 2012, that “the transfer by the copyright
holder to a customer of a copy of a computer program, accompanied by the conclusion between the
same parties of a user licence agreement, constitutes a ‘first sale … of a copy of a program’ within the
meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24”12. The ECJ considers that ‘sale’ ”is an agreement by
which a person, in return for payment, transfers to another person his rights of ownership in an item
of tangible or intangible property belonging to him. It follows that the commercial transaction giving
rise, in accordance with Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24, to exhaustion of the right of distribution of a
copy of a computer program must involve a transfer of the right of ownership in that copy13.

                                                  9
The Court argues that “if the term ‘sale’ within the meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24 were
not given a broad interpretation as encompassing all forms of product marketing characterised by the
grant of a right to use a copy of a computer program, for an unlimited period, in return for payment
of a fee designed to enable the copyright holder to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the
economic value of the copy of the work of which he is the proprietor, the effectiveness of that
provision would be undermined”14.

Therefore, the Court states: “the right of distribution of a copy of a computer program is exhausted if
the copyright holder who has authorised, even free of charge, the downloading of that copy from the
internet onto a data carrier has also conferred, in return for payment of a fee intended to enable him
to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the economic value of the copy of the work of which he is
the proprietor, a right to use that copy for an unlimited period15.

This circumstance entitles the licensee to the resale of a copy of a computer program but licensor
must be allowed to ensure, by all technical means at his disposal, that the copy still in the hands of
the reseller is made unusable16.

So the Court concluded that “[a]n original acquirer who resells a tangible or intangible copy of a
computer program for which the copyright holder’s right of distribution is exhausted in accordance
with Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24 must, in order to avoid infringing the exclusive right of
reproduction of a computer program which belongs to its author, laid down in Article 4(1)(a) of
Directive 2009/24, make his own copy unusable at the time of its resale17.

In practical terms, it may become impossible for the licensor to obtain evidence of such deletion, and
so it may raise concerns, unless there are technical mechanisms capable of retrieving, detecting and
eliminating all traces of the software so it is likely that software houses will propose standard terms
which will, in practical terms, render impossible or, at least, minimize the cases of software transfer
between licensees.

A regular audit on the premises of the licensee may be the only possibility for the resale of the
content, and this condition should probably be expressly included in standard licensing terms, thus
reducing the first acquirer’s will to resell and defending the rights holders from a possible loss of
clients that resale implies.

C.Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

Q.15 YES

Q.16 Even if registration is not mandatory, it is generally acknowledged as the best possible way to
avoid doubts in relation to who created the work, who holds the rights, how to require and obtain a
valid license…

The world has changed so much since the last revision of the Bern Convention, that we must simplify
access to copyright, and thus we would recommend the follow-up of any new technological

instruments that allow for DRM to be traced back to such holders, and so, potential users wouldn’t
have any excuse to avoid paying or obtaining licenses from the legitimate rights holders.

The implementation and progressive integration of existing Data Basis into a World all encompassing
Register of works, which authors and Companies would be strongly advised to use before starting
any economic exploitation of their works.

This would also approach Copyright and Neighbouring Rights to Trade Mark and Patents law, where
the registry is the ultimate criterion to determine legitimacy to perform any acts of material
exploitation.

This would also represent an interesting form of avoiding “Orphan Works” and facilitating the
research for those who want to use third-party’s creations and blend it into new creations (User-
Generated Content).

Q.17 The only disadvantage of such a system would be the probable high costs which such a Data
Basis might represent, unless the International Community or the EU decided to participate in such a
bold project. Access to the Registry should have to be simple, streamlined, and inexpensive, so that
individuals, as well as Companies would be economically able to register works, to avoid a “race to
the Registry” with potential detriment to the individual authors.

However, we too must admit that Copyright and Neighbouring Rights has become, in a highly
industrialized and socially sophisticated World, an increasingly important way to protect talent and
investment in the creation of talent, and therefore it is only natural that Companies may represent
the most of the entries.

Q.18 The most important incentive would be the legal presumption of ownership, admitting rebuttal
by undeniable evidence to the contrary. But other incentives, such as the provision of DRM and
similar forms of acknowledgement and technological mechanisms or devices allowing to trace back
the way to rights holders could also work as incentives for rights holders to register their works or
services in that Registry.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers?

Q.19 The EU could provide those equal opportunities for funding and let the market function in order
to elect the system which will become the international pattern, without trying to influence the
market.

E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Q.20 The current terms reflect an intention to protect the creators and the next generation after
them. Sometimes the terms end up by privileging Companies which become beneficiaries of creator’s
rights.

Companies, on the other hand, are institutions aimed at a life much longer than individuals, but can
typically engage in industrial production modes, where new creations are constantly replacing the
older.




                                              11
The diversity of situations is not in favor of any modification in terms, at least for the time being. The
current framework seems to be balanced enough and the level of harmonization reached is highly
satisfactory.



III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

There is certainly no need of exceptions or limitations in cases where the public interest doesn’t
impose them, and this is the case of analogue uses. However, in case of multiterritorial use of
Copyrighted Works, it is possible that the lack of harmonization leads to particular difficulties in
assessing whether a particular form of use should be subject to rights holder permission, or not. The
Copyright Directive has already established a set of exceptions of limitations which is a very
comprehensive one, in view of the needs presented by digital works. The only exception which is
absolutely necessary in a digital environment is the transient reproduction, without which there is no
possible computer work, and turning all the other possibilities into mandatory exceptions would
severely disrupt some markets where there are licensing and other forms of contractual terms
perfectly capable of satisfying the public interest. For example, in the case of Libraries, Museums or
any other kind of Non-lucrative purpose Establishments, there is often a very wide and stable
licensing agreement where the Parties clearly define their rights and obligations towards each other,
sometimes including a specific form of consideration, but always acknowledging the name of the
author (one of the so-called “moral rights”). If it works in some Countries, without abuse, maybe this
solutions could be the subject of an extensive report and then the Commission could issue a new
Communication on the subject, recommending that further harmonization takes place, although only
for the purposes of digital uses, and above all, with full respect for the Three-Step Test procedure, as
required by art. 5 (5) of the Copyright Directive18

The latter test has been the subject of clarification in July 2008, by a number of eminent academics,
such as Christophe Geiger, Reto M. Hilty, Jonathan Griffiths, Uma Sutersanen (initiators and co-
ordinators) and obtained the contributions of a number of other international experts, namely Bert
Hugenholz, who teaches at the IVIR (Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam, The
Netherlands), which were invited to participate by the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property,
Competition and tax Law, jointly with Queen Mary University of London.

The declaration states that “Limitations and exceptions are the most important legal instrument for
reconciling copyright with the individual and collective interests of the general public. In determining
the scope of application of limitations and exceptions, the Three-Step Test should not take into
account only the interests of rightholders. The need to give equal consideration to third party
interests is confirmed explicitly in the Three-Step Test as applied in industrial property law (Art. 17,
Art. 26(2) and Art. 30 TRIPS). The fact that third party interests are not explicitly mentioned in the
Three-Step Test as applied in copyright law does not detract from the necessity of taking such
interests into account. Rather, it indicates an omission that must be addressed by the judiciary.”




18
   “The exceptions and limitations provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall only be applied in certain special cases
which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice
the legitimate interests of the rightholder”

                                                       12
It aims to provide flexibility in view of the needs presented by the digital environment, without
constraining the freedom of discretion of national legislators to permit or prohibit particular
exceptions and limitations.

The academic World has, thus, spoken in favor of a non-restrictive use of the Three-Step Test,
explaining that it constitutes an indivisible entirety, having to be considered together and as a whole,
enabling the creation of new exceptions or limitations, by the Courts, within their respective legal
systems, where they apply , and linking the second step (no conflict with normal exploitation of
protected subject matter) with the prevention of monopolies (exclusive rights shouldn’t be granted
above the necessary level), namely in secondary markets, and particularly where adequate
compensation is ensured, whether or not by contractual means. The legitimate interests of third
parties should be taken into consideration, namely those deriving from human rights and
fundamental freedoms and other public interests such as scientific progress and cultural, social or
economic development, where compensation may be below market rate.

Q.21-22. There may be some problems deriving from differences between Member States in relation
to exceptions and limitations which they particularly recognize, but the solution to these problems is
to be solved by means of extensive interpretation, maybe even through the use of analogy (as
defended by the authors of the Three-Step Test Declaration), in most cases, solutions may lay upon
establishing adequate levels of compensation, above or below the market level, considering the
public interest which is in stake.

Q.23 NO

Q.24 YES. For multiterritorial uses, such as the case of Internet, one may be driven to the conclusion
that there may be cases where some uses are protected only in some Member States, and not in all
of the E.U. According to the above-referred Declaration, Limitations and Exceptions should not be
interpreted to narrowly or restrictively, an so there is room for enough flexibility without a need for
further legislative intervention, nor the mandatory imposition of all the exceptions and limitations to
all the Member States.

Q.25. We don’t condone any kind of overall exception (e.g. “fair use” as in the U.S. Copyright law, or
“fair dealing” as in the U.K. Law) for it is normally a source of uncertainty for rights holders and tends
to generate an enormous amount of disparity in its application. Authors are unanimous about the
lack of precision of such a mechanism, and the negative consequences of having such disparities in
Court Decisions. It’s better that exceptions and limitations remain specific and limited to a
manageable number.

Even the E.C.J. has always been extremely careful in interpreting exceptions and limitations
established by Member States, and has limited its Decisions to the statement of what would be
compatible or incompatible with the Community Framework, namely in Cases such as C-521/11
(Amazon v. Austro-Mechana), C-457/2011(KyoCeraMita v. VG Wort), C-462/09 (Stichting de
Thuiskopie v. Opus Supplies Deutschland GmbH et alie), C-5/08 (Infopaq International A/S v. Danske
Dagblades Forening) and C-467/08 (Padawan SL v Sociedad General de Autores y Editores –SGAE).




                                                13
National Courts must also enjoy some flexibility, as above-referred, to continuously apply the law to
the concrete and diversified situations which are presented before them, with full respect for the
case-law of the ECJ.

 26. NO. Most exceptions and limitations (v.g. private use) are common to the majority of the
Member States and therefore do not pose a problem for the most types of use. Even if there is a
problem with some form of digital use in some Country, it’s very likely to disappear on account of the
level of harmonization reached. The user who is willing to obtain the right to incorporate someone
else’s creation give its creativity. Harmonization of the most common forms of private
copies’/private use exception seems to be making its way, very progressively, and determining some
kind of uniformity in terms of exceptions would very likely distort some perfectly viable business
models. On the other hand, compensation for exceptions/limitations under the form of “equitable
remuneration” is progressively harmonized as a EU concept, as decided in the Cases C-467/08
(Padawan v. SGAE), C-245/00 (SENA v. NOOS), C-521/11(Amazon v. Austro-Mechana), C-457/11 a C-
460/11 (VGwort V. Kioceramita et alie) and C-462/09 (Stichting De Thuiskopie v. Opus Supplies et
alie), C-314/12 (Constantin Filmverleih v. UPC Telekabel), C-463/12 (Copydan Bandcopi v. NOKIA), C-
435/12 ACI ADAM et alie v. Stichting de Thuiskopie) as the form of measuring the losses incurred by
the rights holder, and so there is already a tendency towards the harmonization of criteria, even
though different Member States can choose between different limitations/exceptions, considering
that the public interest which causes the exclusive right to be sacrificed is not always the same from
Member State to Member State, and that the Principle should be to enhance the exclusive rights, as
stated in Recital 9 of the Copyright Directive.

It’ also worth noticing that, in France, according to the last HADOPI Report, a workshop on
exceptions and limitations conducted by Jacques Toubon with the support of two experts has led to
the need to introduce more flexibility in the current European Copyright framework, by redefining
exceptions in more general terms, however, it should be sufficient to do it with the inspiration of the
exhaustive list contained in the Copyright Directive19.

Q.27 The “fair compensation” is a European law concept, addressed by a number of ECJ Decisions
which is to be calculated on the basis of the losses suffered by the rights holders. Being so, the
compensation for such losses should be reimbursed, by each persons who benefits from the
exception, to the legitimate rights holders, in each Territory where the relevant act of Copyright use
takes place, through the usual means of cooperation between Copyright Management Societies or
Organizations, representing different categories of rights holders, which will also be able to represent
each other, according to the proposed Collective Management Organizations Directive, thus
organizing themselves on a voluntary basis.

4. Mass digitization

40. According to art. 75(2) of the Portuguese Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Code, it is possible
to communicate to the public or to make available (in the sense of art. 3(1) of the Copyright
Directive) copyrighted works existing in their collections or property, not subject to licensing or
purchasing terms, for the purpose of research or personal academic study, to individual members of
the public by means of specific terminals, created for this purpose, in the premises of libraries,
museums, public archives and schools. This means that such copyrighted works can be freely
digitized, and made available through digital platforms, without a need to obtain authorization,
subject only to the author’s identification, whenever possible, as long as there are no licensing or
contractual terms preventing such individual access, using terminals installed within the premises of
a public library, museum or archive and provided there is no commercial advantage, whatsoever.
This is totally in line with art. 5(3)(n) of the Copyright Directive.

In this case, it would probably make sense to broaden the scope of the exception in order to allow
the investigator, or student, a mobile or a home access, where the identity of the beneficiary is duly
verified, because of being a benefit granted intuitu personae. It would suffice to provide the
beneficiary with a login and a password, although this will never be a guarantee that he will be the
only one to access the work.

This issue could probably be addressed by means of a clarification which assumed that, for the
purpose of such an exception, the website of the public institution shall also be considered as being
its own premises.

The Commission is also expected to follow-up and respect the conclusion reached by the several
thematic working groups set for the Licenses for Europe Dialogue Initiative, launched through the
Communication where relevant stakeholders, despite not having agreed in the diagnosis of the

problem to address, have, nevertheless, been able to engage in a Ten Pledges Commitment, of major
importance, set together in a Joint Declaration of 13.11.2013, namely in contributing to “improved
availability of e-books across borders and across devices, a Pledge signed by European Writers
Council (EWC), the European Booksellers Federation (EBF), International Association of Scientific,
Technical & Medical Publishers (STM), Federation of European Publishers (FEP) and the European
Publishers Council (EPC).

42. NÃO

43. N.A.

44. Art. 75(2) of the Portuguese Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Code allows the reproduction,
distribution and the making available to the public of parts of a published copyrighted works, for
purposes of teaching and education, subject only to the author’s identification, whenever possible,
as long as that is the only purpose and there is no commercial advantage, whatsoever. Such parts of
the work must not be mistaken for the original and the quoting shouldn’t be so extensive that
hinders the interest for the original work. So far, this exception has worked well and is probably all
that is necessary for teaching/educational purposes. The only modification which could be necessary
would be to apply the exception to the entire work, not just parts of it. Article 5 (3) (a) allows
Member States to establish any kind of use, as long as it is for teaching purposes and scientific
research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved, so the proposed
extensive interpretation would still be in line with the limits and definition provided by the Copyright
Directive. Therefore, we don’t see any need for a revision or broadening of the exception.

C- Research

47. (a) No. For researchers, it is normally required a digital ID which anyone qualifying for the
research can obtain by applying to its University, which entitles one to access online libraries, where
several e-books are available. Bearing such an ID, one can subscribe to several Public Libraries or
Private Collections and do the research. Such institutions are allowed to grant online access to
works, and licensing contracts are negotiated with publishers or rights holders, normally without
major difficulties. We assume this to be the best possible practice, since the procedures to qualify as
a researcher for the purpose of online access to works must be rather restrictive, in view of the need
to prevent damages to normal acts of exploitation.

the formula is widely open, we don’t see any need for a revision or broadening of the exception. The
system works in a rather satisfying manner, but it can still be improved within the definition
established by the Copyright Directive.

E. Text and Data mining

53. (a) NO

54. N.A.

55. N.A.

56. We think that, in respect to Text and Data mining, the Commission should follow-up and respect
the conclusion reached by the specific working group set for the Licenses for Europe Dialogue
Initiative, launched through the Communication where relevant stakeholders, despite not having
agreed in the diagnosis of the problem to address, have, nevertheless, been able to engage in
several Commitments, set together in the Joint Declaration of 13.11.2013, namely in contributing to
“easier text and data mining of subscription-based material for non-commercial researchers”. It
seems that Text and Data Mining may be interpreted as part of the scientific research exception [art.
5 (3) (a) of the CD] or as reproduction of published articles for the purpose of informational purposes
[art. 5 (3) (c) of the CD] or even as quotation for purposes of criticism or review relating to a work or
other subject-matter already lawfully made available (art. 5 (3)(d)of the CD).

In alternative, and as follow-up of the Licenses for Europe initiative, “scientific publishers have
proposed a licensing clause for subscription-based material as a solution, further supported by the
necessary technological solutions to enable mining. This is expected to allow researchers to mine, for
non-commercial scientific research purposes and at no additional cost, journals subscribed by their
university or research institution. Researchers will be able to connect to a web-based “mining portal”
through which they can access the existing infrastructure of the participating publishers and mine
publications subscribed by their university or research institution. A “click-through licence” for
individual researchers has been developed.”

This means, of course, that a new exception for text and data-mining may not be necessary after all.

By 11/11/2013, the following publishers had signed up to this commitment the American Chemical
Society, British Medical Journal Publishing Group Ltd, Brill Publishers, Elsevier BV, Georg Thieme
Verlag KG, Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, Institute of Physics / IOP Publishing Ltd, John Wiley &
Sons Ltd, New England Journal of Medicine (Massachusetts Medical Society), Oxford University Press,
Springer Science + Business Media Deutschland GmbH, Taylor and Francis Ltd, Wolters Kluwer Health
(Medical Research) Ltd.

57. YES. Technical interoperability and compatibility of formats. This is an issue for the market to
solve.

F. USER-GENERATED CONTENT

58- 59 (a) NO

60- 63 We follow with the utmost of interests the initiatives ongoing which relate to a technological
solution for the identification and control of copyrighted works seamlessly throughout the digital
platforms, such as the one undertaken by the Linked Content Coalition right-holders association,
which gathers some important Media Groups such as RTL, Axel Springer, Globo, ITV, technological
partners and or license facilitators such as Microsoft, MovieLabs, Microgen, Common Rights, Coyright
Clearance Centre, Copyright Licensing Agency, IPR License, NLA, Rightscom, PLUS Coalition, to name
just a few, with the most encompassing Press and News Associations or Producers/Press Agencies,
such as News International, Associated Newspapers, EMMA, ENPA, EPC, EVA, EWC, FEP, Gruppo
Espresso, Pearson, IPA, Journaux Francophones Belges, CEPIC, Music Publishers such as EMI M.P., as
well as a few Consultants and other independent IP users and representatives. The LCC developed
the Web Content Declaration (WCD): “Creators – "self-publishers" – will be able to attach a machine-
readable identification to their content, in order to facilitate claims and acknowledgement of
authorship and associated rights. This will make it easier to use (and re-use) content. Through more
national and regional “hub” websites, like the new industry-led Copyright Hub in the UK, industry will
accelerate the development of an efficient market helping users to get the licences they need.

The LCC believes that “The answer to the machine is in the machine.20”and explain their project in the
following manner: “As we move into a machine‐to‐machine environment, the business of managing
copyright must become a machine‐mediated process, in which the complexity of copyright is
completely hidden from the individual user, as it always has been in the past.”

The Linked Content Coalition21 identifies its core thesis as a simple one: “The best response to the
challenges posed by the growth in the online sector lies in a more effective deployment of technology
to enable more efficient licensing solutions. The copyright industries1 have already embraced the
digital environment and recognised that it is essential to develop a standards-based infrastructure
that will allow copyright to be licensed and administered more effectively and thus allow creators and
rightsholders of all kinds to be properly rewarded for their efforts”.

“We need to be able to identify the content being used and who controls in the rights in it; we need to
be able to identify the user and the usage; we need to be able automatically to link these various
entities together to complete a transaction. Data (those portions which do not threaten privacy or
confidentiality) will need to be held in accessible online databases (sometimes known as registries,
but not to be confused with any attempt to impose statutory registration of copyright works which
we would oppose). Those databases will need to be linked together through a trusted (and
trustworthy) messaging infrastructure. These in turn need links to secure transactional systems that
handle payments that will support many different types of business model – from low value
micropayments to high value “all you can eat” subscriptions. And this infrastructure has to be
pervasive – as pervasive as the network itself.”

New forms of technical identification for Copyrighted Works such as Musical and Audiovisual
Content are being deployed at this moment, such as ISPN or ISAN, respectively for Phonograms and
for Audiovisual, and we believe that a World Registry of Works, even if not regarded as a legal
obligation for the awarding of Copyrights, could certainly provide the basis for a legal presumption
of rights ownership, prevent the copyrighted works from being regarded as “orphan”, in the sense of
Directive 2012/28/EU of 25.10.2012, and enabling users who want to license content to easily obtain
the contact of the relevant licensor for the purpose of reuse, in terms which will have to be defined,
preferably by a standard general contract, by the rights holder/licensor, as a form of rewarding the
original creator, without which there wouldn’t probably be a secondary act of creation, by the final
user.

In terms of facilitating UGC licensing, it is also important to notice that, as an outcome of the
Licenses for Europe initiative, namely within the Commitments issued by most of the stakeholders,
there will be:

a) New pan-European licences enabling background music on websites, as well as small-scale
   licences for background music on websites and small-scale web-podcasting (IFPI and GESAC);
b) New licensing solutions allowing users (both business as individual) to know what they’re able to
   do with text and images and streamline licensing solutions, and to identify rights holders, thus
   enabling licensing solutions and easy pay-per-use payment systems;
c) New forms of “machine-readable identification to copyrighted content which will facilitate
   claims and acknowledgement of authorship and associated rights.

IV. PRIVATE COPYING AND REPROGRAPHY

64. NO. First of all, and most important of all, we believe that the Private use exception and its
specific form of compensation should never be regarded as a form of condoning, or even waving the
illicit nature of piracy, namely when it is done al a large scale, between peers, which use specific
types of software to enable the massive digitization of commercially acquired works, without asking
for the consent of rights holders. The private use copy remains subject to the three-steps principle
originally established by the Bern Convention, precisely to address this exception, and now enshrined
in art. 5 (5) of the Copyright Directive. This means that the copies must be made in the context of
home or privacy and not spread out for the public to access, as occurs in most Peer-To- Peer
communities.

It does help to recall that, according to the Copyright Directive [art. 5 (2) (b)] the private use
exception is only foreseen in relation to the reproduction right, and not also as regards the
Communication to the public right. There is absolutely no legitimacy in uploading or sharing one’s
rightful copies with a whole community of friends which would probably acquire a sample for their
own personal use and copies.

This said, it is now of the utmost importance to pay attention to the conclusions and
recommendations of the António Vitorino’s report on his mission, bestowed upon him by
Commissioner Barnier, to mediate and lead the process of stakeholder dialogue concerning Private
Copying Levies.


                                              19
In general he has become convinced “that it would be best for rightholders to fully embrace the new
direct licensing opportunities in the digital environment. Licensing fees are already by far the most
important source of income for rightholders, and are well suited to reflect the actual use of content
and to ensure that the rightholders are paid for acts of copying that also take place in this context.”
However, he has concluded that, despite of the new technology -enhanced digital mechanisms of
identification and control of works “levy systems will remain relevant in the immediate future”22.

The author of the Recommendations doesn’t believe that a comprehensive harmonization at EU
level , including with regard to the goods subject to levies and the applicable tariffs should be
envisaged23.

In conclusion, he recommends a shift of the liability to pay the levy to the entity selling to the end
user and only once, in the Country of destination (Member State where the final customer resides)
or, alternatively, through clear and predictable ex ante exemptions schemes (for manufacturers and
importers who don’t send directly to consumers and goods bought and used by professional users)24
and more coherence with regard to the process of setting levies, namely by defining “harm”
uniformly across the EU as the value consumers attach to the additional copies in question (lost
profit, “economic harm”, based on counterfactual hypothetic situation) and some basic procedural
requirements25.

In line with the Case-Law of the ECJ ( Case C-467/08 Padawan v. SGAE), the “harm” subject to fair
compensation arises not only from a single copy but from a number of a natural person’s activities,
which, taken together, amount to relevant “harm” caused to rightholders.

We support this view, namely the “State of Destination” principle, rather than a centralization of the
collection of levies by a single point throughout the EU. It is important to avoid disruption of the
current consumption patterns and keep the national CRM organizations sufficiently financed, instead
of determining their replacement for a central European body, which would probably take time to
calculate and correctly redistribute the rights collected. CRM organizations at National level are one
example of the EU diversity and should remain so.

65. NO. According to Mr Vitorino’s Recommendations, the way forward should imply “providing a
procedural framework that would reduce complexity, guarantee objectiveness and ensure the
observance of strict time-limits.26” and that “Licensed copies should not trigger the application of
levies. The opposite view would pave the way for double payments. Consumers cannot be expected to
show understanding for such double payments27.

We agree with this view.

66. Cloud computing is the most recent form of file-storing and resource to third-parties owned
technologies and infrastructures. As the recent Case-Law of the German Higher Court has
established, the Cloud ceases to be regarded as a platform for private use and private reproduction
of copyrighted works the moment its user provides members of the public with an hyperlink which
enables access to such Cloud28. The ISPs operating Cloud services must obviously pay a levy
measured according to the offered data storage capacity, and this seems to be the fairest way to
reward rights holders for the contribution they provide to the success and need of such services. It
wouldn’t make sense to charge a private copy levy upon devices which store copyrighted material
and leave the most used storage service unaffected.

67. YES. In line with Mr. Vitorino’s Recommendations29, ensuring the visibility of the levy to the final
customer is a practice that enhances transparency and would bring added value for the market, as
well as allow the consumer to understand that copyright has its own value because there wouldn’t
be any cultural production without incentive and reward.

V. FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS

72. We think that the negotiation of licensing contracts between rights holders and users are still the
best way to achieve balance in the market. However, there may be situations where there is a strong
gap between Parties, in terms of economic capacity or economic dependency. These situations are
addressed by the freedom acknowledged to any rights holders to mandate Collecting Societies or
engaging into Contracts with Publishers, where the latter represent the former, for every aspect of
rights exploitation.

73. There are already several legal instruments to prevent abuse of contractual power, namely in the
Unfair Practices Directive, applicable in general to all market sectors and the Consumer Protection
Framework. There are also rules to prevent abuse of rights contained in the Directive 2011/77/EU of
27.09.2011 (term of protection of copyright and certain related rights). Therefore we do not think
that further legislation is necessary.

75. NO. We think that the only open issue regarding the implementation of the Copyright
Enforcement Directive has to do with National Courts of Law, their own sensitiveness to the cases
presented before them, the evidence required for an injunction to be issued, and the diligence of
rights holders in promoting the right initiatives. So, in fact, the only remaining work which has to be
done is enforcing the Copyright Enforcement Directive.

76. The EU “safe harbor” framework, contained in the E-Commerce Directive of 200030, requires
that ISPs are not involved in the communication procedure, either as the source or modifiers of its
contents, in order to invoke a legitimate lack of knowledge of any infringement. Their activity must
remain of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature. As a consequence of that, specific
warnings, v.g. the so called “notice and take down” procedures (NTD), which ISPs should comply
with, may originate ISP liability in case of unjustified lack of compliance.

On the other hand, the EU Law allows Member States to impose upon ISPs the obligation to
communicate to the competent authorities, at their request, user’s identification data, which allows
rights holders to notify alleged or supposed infringers and thus dissuade their actions. The ECJ has
stated in a consistent manner that this obligation doesn’t collide with the personal data protection
framework, even if it doesn’t appear explicitly in the relevant Directives (Personal Data Protection
and E-Privacy Directives)31.

 A first conclusion from EU Framework and Case-Law leads us to confirm that the concept of liability
which is in stake in European Case Law, is clearly one of subjective liability, that is, a kind which is not
based upon profitability or economic interest on exploiting the data (content), since these could
involve an objective or presumed liability.

Unlike the specific US DMCA approach, as well as some Member States (the U.K., France, among
others) the European Law makers have adopted the view that notice and take down procedures
should not be regulated by the law itself, and instead, the matter should be left for self–regulation,
which should be expressly encouraged. This approach wasn’t helpful. Further legislative work upon
the E-Commerce Directive may lead to the increment of ISPs cooperation obligations, but will
certainly also increase the number of copyright holders’ efforts for the identification of their works
with the help of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Technological Protection Measures (TPM),
assuming ISPs will adopt platform technology which will enable acknowledgement of copyright
protected works.

77. NO. The whole European legal system is set to protect ISPs from indirect liability, except when
there is a clear cut case of involvement in the infringement practices, at least when their own acts of
economic exploitation imply knowledge of infringement, namely by placing of advertising in
automatic association with search results or by actively explaining the final users how to advertise.

  “Safe-Harbor” provisions are those which exclude ISP liability, v.g. for third-party acts of
infringement.

Influenced by the restrictive guidelines of the ECJ, the national Courts of EU Member States have not
always shown a complete capacity for distinguishing between a general surveillance obligation,
which is prevented by article 15 of ECD, and a specific filtering of notified copyright infringing
content, even if the necessary tools in terms of software are available in the market or provided by
the right-holders themselves, for free.

Nevertheless, Recitals 45 and 46 of ECD, together with Recital 59 of Copyright Directive, provide a
legal basis for specific filtering mechanisms to be imposed upon ISPs, and the currently available
technologies do not impose an excessive burden in terms of cost or technological complexity. It’s
only a matter of ISPs and rights holders working together in order to reach solutions which could
make life easier for both: rights holders would be more capable of detecting earlier stages of
infringing situations, and ISPs would be more protected against liability, since the implementation of
automatic filtering mechanisms would be qualified as a proper way to avoid vicarious liability, and
provided there would not be any acts of inducing or encouraging users to upload, share or download
copyright protected works.

Currently, with social networks and the internet community globally linked and sharing a high level of
awareness – a very positive characteristic in the perspective of Human–Rights watching – there
cannot be a serious public debate on how to protect IP from piracy, or common theft, because it
instantly triggers a massive choir of protests, which are, allegedly, defending the right to privacy or
the freedom of expression, but end up mixing all the concepts. None of those rights can serve as
argument to defend a breach of third parties’ IP.

It is very important that the protection of privacy does not translate into the protection of piracy.

As we know, EU Member States are allowed to use the injunction mechanism against ISPs for
obtaining the names and addresses of users which allegedly are breaching copyright, and there is no
issue of privacy that supersedes the protection of intellectual property against piracy.
Also according to revelations by the Electronic Frontiers Foundation32, Music, Movies, TV and
Broadband leaders have teamed up to put an end to copyright infringement, announcing a new
common framework for what they have baptized “Copyright Alerts”, which is “a state-of-the art
system, very similar to a credit card fraud alert designed to inform, but also educate and formally
notify internet subscribers when their internet accounts are being used (possibly by someone else)
for online content theft. The system is entirely voluntary, and it is expected to benefit consumers of
internet services, as well as copyright holders alike. It aims at providing a “common framework” for
NTD procedures, based on the market “best practices”, and it not only alerts subscribers to possible
infringement as it promotes access to legal online content services.”

The system EFF defends is compatible with some technical measures, although before the blocking of
network access, there are a number of procedures to be taken. It seems to us that some of the
existing best practices in terms of Notice and Action (NA) procedures should be embraced by the EU
and implemented in a harmonized way in order to provide for further certainty in fighting piracy.

It is, of course, highly recommendable that all NTD procedures are adopted by the Courts and that
only the Courts are awarded the legal competence to, ultimately, block access to the Internet, after a
number of written warnings (the so called «cease and desist letters»).

National legislators have the legal possibility of establishing a framework for indirect liability, namely
vicarious and contributory liability, based on financial profit and control, but always based upon
knowledge of specific infringement actions of which ISPs are duly notified by rights holders or of
circumstances leading to such awareness.

Secondly, national legislators are allowed to increase the level of administrative or cooperation
duties impending upon ISPs, namely information and copyright awareness obligations, which can
lead to ISP liability, in case of lack of compliance: this will never be regarded as being the same as
holding ISPs liable for direct copyright infringement: this liability is for their own duties, not “for the
information transmitted”.

Finally, rights holders should continue to join efforts, as they have already done in so many examples
described herein, and work together in the creation of an all-encompassing clearing website, aimed
at providing licenses for the use of copyright protected works, and heavily promoted by ISPs in the
course of their information duties towards subscribers, where the payment unit would be the “click”,
a unit which would certainly arise the interest of regular internet advertisers: each “click” would
direct copyright license seekers to an advertising webpage, and would consequently mean one page
view, which would be economically meaningful for the advertising industry, thus solving the licensing
problem without the users having to spend one single cent.
