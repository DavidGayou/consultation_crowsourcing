rules

Introduction

The Football Association is the national governing body for football in England. Our remit covers
three main areas - England national teams and governing and promoting the game at both
professional and amateur/grassroots level.

We utilise the commercial value of the England national teams (of which there are 24 including
youth, women’s and disability teams), The FA Cup and Wembley Stadium in order to generate
revenue to reinvest back into the game including, importantly, promoting grassroots football in
England. The FA is a not-for-profit organisation and we reinvest £100m back into football every year.
This revenue is largely generated by TV rights, sponsorship and events held at Wembley Stadium.

The coverage of FA matches is hosted on a variety of audio-visual platforms across the EU, with FA
Cup matches and home international friendly match rights distributed by The FA, and European
Championship and World Cup international qualification match rights sold by UEFA on the FA’s
behalf. The FA Women’s Super League is also shown in the UK by terrestrial and satellite
broadcasters who also provide the option of multi-platform viewing.

Because of our redistributive structure, we naturally have an interest in how rights are sold and how
our product is consumed both in England and across the EU. Although the consultation document
does not specifically refer to sports content producers, any reform will have a significant impact on
our activities too, as we sell our rights to broadcasters who are implicated in this review.

The FA has responded to questions relevant to sport in the consultation:

Q 2 – Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

No. The demand for our product is consumer led and regional. Rights for The FA’s matches are sold
based on production language which allows broadcasters to create a product tailored to their
viewers’ needs. This territorial nature is noted in the Commission’s White Paper on Sport (2007) and
can be seen by the fact that listed events in different countries, implemented as part of the Audio,
Visual and Media Services Directive, clearly have specific national interest- for example, the Giro
d’Italia is protected in Italy and the All-Ireland Hurling Final protected in Ireland.

Where there is either a limited market or cross-border consumption, the market itself finds solutions
in order to offer the consumer the product it needs. For example, recent Women’s Internationals
have been available to all European consumers on FA.com and any UEFA Champion’s League
matches can be consumed in any country via UEFA.com.
Q 3 – How often are you asked to grant multi territorial licenses?

Because of the separation of markets outlined above, there is not a general demand for our product
on a multi-territorial basis. Multi-territorial programming would provide an inferior product for
football fans looking for coverage which is specifically tailored to their needs.

Q 5 – Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all
the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on the service recipient?

Yes, territoriality is hugely important for both sports fans and grassroots sport. As highlighted above,
national broadcasters want to provide a product specific to their audience and therefore
territoriality provides a better product for the consumer. Enforcing pan-European licensing would
exclude smaller media providers from entering the market; territoriality enables stronger and fairer
competition between broadcasters in Europe. Indeed, should licences be granted on a pan-European
basis exclusively, only the largest media corporations in Europe could afford to bid for and
subsequently utilise the rights.

As a not-for-profit organisation which reinvests its surplus back into football, The FA’s ability to sell
our product in numerous markets is beneficial and provides a larger return for grassroots sport. To
put it simply, the removal of territorial selling would mean less investment in grassroots football in
England.

Q 7 – Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market led-
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

Yes, the Commission could have a positive impact on the market by protecting content producers
from piracy and other copyright infringements. The market finds solutions to issues such as cross-
border availability by answering consumer demand - whatever form these solutions take, it is
important that the ability to create content is not undermined by a lack of protection for content
producers from illegal companies parasitically using content.


Q 75 – Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Yes, it is quite clear that current civil enforcement structures are impotent in the face of illegal live
streaming of sports events. Regulation was not created with live streaming in mind and therefore
acting in real time is particularly difficult. Unlike recorded materials such as film and music, it is the
real time match action where the rights have their main value. We strongly recommend a system
which cuts off illegal activity such as piracy of live rights at source in a timely fashion, and then
pursues the necessary process subsequently. While we are aware that this does indeed create many
challenges, the Commission should also bear in mind that without addressing this issue, it will be
impossible to adequately protect live rights.
Q 76 – Is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose?

No, we would welcome greater intervention from Internet Service Providers and online platforms in
addressing illegal activity. This can be achieved while upholding data protection and privacy
requirements of the individual.

Q78 – Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well
as a single framework for enforcement

No, the territorial nature of sports is best served by the current framework which recognises
national copyright titles. The European Commission should also remain cognisant that creating a
single EU title will, in the case of non-profit national governing bodies of sport, have an adverse
effect on investment into grassroots sport across the continent.

Q 80 – Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?

The current legislation is not broken, but is outdated.

The supposition that there are barriers to entry in the market is incorrect. Recent activity in England
has shown that barriers for new entrants are minimal. BT Sport is a new entrant as of this season
and they currently cover The FA Cup and the Women’s Super League. BT has also acquired the rights
to a number of Premier League games too. The market for sports rights is rapidly evolving and it
appears that it will continue to do so without further intervention from The European Commission.

Likewise the belief that cross-border offers cannot develop is also untrue. The FA has content which
is available across Europe on-line, but the nature of the content is market and consumer driven and
solutions to improved on-line content will develop more quickly from consumer demand than by
legislative intervention.

Where the European Commission can act to help develop the market is by taking action against
those who run parasitic websites which provide illegal digital streaming of matches. Such streaming
of sport is common and, for example, the advertising received on such sites is estimated to be £12m
per year on English Premier League football matches alone. Some of these sites can be subscription
based too. Considering that The FA, as a non-profit organisation, invests the revenue it generates
from its media rights into supporting grassroots football, ensuring that 100% of the value of rights is
available to be diverted to sport is of real importance for the long term sustainability of grassroots
sport.

The FA asks the European Commission to help the content producers and the advertising industry to
find efficient solutions to prevent parasitic websites diverting advertising revenue away from sport.
