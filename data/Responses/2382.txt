Reference:      Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules
                Relating to a possible Amendment of ‚European Copyright’



Ladies and Gentlemen,

My office in the first line deals with copyright and related rights cases and is acting on behalf of
artists, composers, collecting societies, publishers, producers, theatres, etc. Recently my office was
involved in the ‘Luksan/Van der Let’ and ‘amazon/austro mechana’ cases with the Court of Justice
of the European Union. Furthermore I have written and edited many articles and books on this
subject, e.g. – jointly with Silke von Lewinski – the title ‘European Copyright – A Commentary’,
published with Oxford University Press in 2010. Since years I am teaching at the Vienna University
Law School and several other Austrian universities.
Having participated also in the Commission’s Copyright Group of Experts, which for whatever
reason was neither dissolved nor convened in recent years, I take the opportunity to shortly
comment on the questions set out in the Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright
rules. Since I participated in the comments which are submitted simultaneously by the Austrian
Group of ALAI the content and wording is more or less identical.

II.   Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe
(aa) Preliminary remark
      Prior to touching upon this point the fundamental question must be discussed, whether the
      author (and other rightholders) must be able to effectively control the exploitation of their
      creations on the grounds of their exclusive rights granted in the Single Market by national
      laws also in the context of online-use. In favour of such control one can argue on the basis of
      the very purpose and function of exclusive rights as established in International and European
      Copyright and on the grounds of the legitimate interests of rightholders.
      If this should be the case, it also must be possible for rightholders to restrict a licence in
      regard of its territorial extent in the Single Market, if there is no evidence of a predominant

       general interest to the contrary. Whether this is the case or not, must be discussed in depth
       prior to postulating that online-services necessarily are to be accessible from anywhere in
       Europe. In discussing this question it must be born in mind that different media and situations
       may have to be treated differently.
(bb) The impact of the the Services-Directive
       However this may be, the Services-Directive, in my opinion, is no obstacle, since the ECJ
       recently decided with regard to a possible monopoly of collecting societies under the national
       law of a Member State1 that copyright is exempted from the application of this Directive.
(cc) The territorial splitting of licences
       It may be worthwhile to be mentioned that the so-called territoriality of intellectual property
       rights has nothing to do with the question of territorial restriction of the exploitation rights.
       Even in the case of a unitary European copyright title the question would arise whether a
       territorial restriction of exploitation rights (licences) should be effective or not, as this is the
       case under national law with regard to the national territory or parts thereof (provinces and the
       like).


B.     Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorized (or
       not) in digital transmissions?
       1. The act of “making available”
(a)    Preliminary remarks
       In my view the making available of copyright subject matter (on the internet) is to be
       considered as a single act that is completely performed in offering such matter for
       downloading and/or streaming on the internet, irrespective of whether the protected material
       in fact is downloaded or streamed (‘consumed’), as this is the case in regard of broadcasting.
       This fact appears to be the very reason, why exceptions and limitations have been set out in
       the Infosoc-Directive (Article 5).
       The reproduction of protected subject matter on the ‘transportation route’ (in proxy servers) is
       covered by the (mandatory) exception in favour of transient or incidental copies (Art 5 para 1
       of the Infosoc-Directive), whereas the (transient or incidental) reproduction generated on the
       user’s computer (in the RAM-memory of the user’s computer) pursuant to the second case of
       this very provision is exempted from copyright protection as well. However, the application of
       the latter provision is dependent upon the fact that the applicable national law of the Member
       State, where the reproduction takes place on the user’s computer, provides for an exemption
       (in favour of one’s private use), since otherwise there is no ‘lawful user’.
       The same holds true as regards permanent downloading of copyright material, which may be
       covered by an exception provided for private copying as alluded to in Art 5 para 2 lit b of the
       Infosoc-Directive (or in rare cases will not be covered by such exceptions), according to the
       relevant Member State’s legislation.



1     See ECJ 27 February 2014 case C-351/12 – „Ochranný svaz autorský pro práva k dílům hudebním, o.s. (OSA)“.
                                                 -3-



      Thus the question arises, whether the downloading or streaming from a (legitimate) internet-
      platform is an activity, which is relevant from the point of view of copyright protection at all.
      In my personal view the price paid to such platforms rather is due to the rendering this service
      than to paying copyright fees. Of course, the operator of such platform makes works available
      to the public and, therefore, needs the rightholders’ consent. As a rule he will shift the
      payments made to rightholders to his subscribers. However, such payments are not caused by
      the reproduction of copyright subject matter, but by making it available to the public by the
      operator.
      This seems to be the very reason, why Article 5 para 2 lit b of the Infosoc-Directive explicitly
      stated that such payments are to be taken into consideration nevertheless in fixing the „fair
      compensation“ for private copying. In my opinion, the provision of Article 3 of the Infosoc-
      Directive does not need any further clarification.
(b)   Differentiation between various acts of exploitation on the internet
      However, there might be a need for clarification in regard of drawing the line of demarcation
      between the making available of a work and the broadcasting (on the internet). In the view of
      the Austrian Group, broadcasting is to be circumscribed by making copyright matter available
      to the public by any means of communicating it in the form of (pre-made) programs, which is
      not the case when such material is made available interactively, in particular in the form of
      podcasts so-called.
      Furthermore the pushing of copyright material on the internet e.g. as an attachment of mass-e-
      mails should be considered as sort of distribution according to article 4 of the Infosoc-
      Directive.
      However, since all such differentiation is disputed, clarification may be advisable in this
      regard.
2.    Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
      The fact that two different exploitation rights are involved, when copyright subject matter is
      made available on the internet, namely the reproduction right on the one hand and the making
      available right as such on the other, in no case appears to be an obstacle for any mode of
      exploitation on the internet. The involvement of two (or even more) exploitation rights is
      known from other forms of exploitation as well, as is the case e.g. as regards reproduction for
      broadcasting purposes. As a rule, both exploitation rights are managed by the same rightholder
      (collecting society) anyway.
3.    Linking and Browsing
(a)   Browsing
      As far as browsing is concerned, this use, as a rule, is covered by the exception in favour of
      transient or incidental copying pursuant to Article 5 para 1 of the Infosoc-Directive. There is
      no need of further clarifying this situation.
(b)   Linking
                                                       -4-



        As regards linking the ECJ recently decided that either form of linking is independent the
        rightholder’s consent2. Whereas linking is to be considered as an act of communication to the
        public, the criterion of public is not fulfilled, since there is no “new public” addressed by any
        form of linking.The criterion of ‘new public’ is understood as a public, which was not already
        taken into consideration by the rightholder in making the copyright matter available (on the
        internet)3 without providing for technical protection measures.
        Of course, one could argue that the judgment of the ECJ is not convincing as far as inline-
        linking (framing) is concerned. If one agrees with this argumentation, one could think of
        clarifying Article 3 of the InfoSoc-Directive with this regard. Furthermore, it could be taken
        into consideration to clarify, by which means, apart from technical protection measures,
        rightholders may express their will that the copyright subject matter placed on a website shall
        only be accessed by direct visitors and not through linking.
4.      Download to own digital content
(a)     The problem of online-exhaustion
        This question refers to the basic problem, whether in the case of downloads of copyright
        material with the author’s consent the principle of exhaustion should apply as this is the case,
        when physical copies are distributed (by transfer of ownership) pursuant to Article 4 of the
        Infosoc-Directive. In principle, it seems to be clear that there is no difference between a case
        where e.g. a computer program is downloaded against payment and a case where a physical
        CD or DVD is sent to the acquirer by traditional mail4.
(b)     The ECJ’s jurisprudence with regard to computer progrms
        As regards computer programs the ECJ has confirmed this opinion in its „Oracle“-judgment5.
        However, the Court left open, whether this ‘opening’ of the exhaustion principle also applies
        to other categories of works or other subject matter of protection. In my opinion the minor
        differences in the wording of the later Directives in comparison with the Computer Program
        Directive are only due to the fact that the latter Directive was the first Directive to be adopted
        in the field of copyright and related rights; the slightly differing wording is no argument for a
        differing solution.
(c)     Extension of this ruling to other copyright subject matter (?)
        Against the application of the exhaustion principle to downloaded copies of other subject
        matter of protection than computer programs it may be argued that the obligation to delete the
        first copy6 in case of further distributing (online or offline) of the program (work) may only be

       monitored with difficulties, if at all. Further one could argue that such copies may not be
       recognized from their outward appearance as a legitimate copy on the market. The application
       of the exhaustion principle, therefore, would impede the prosecution of copyright
       infringements.
       As a conceivable approach to solving the problem it could be discussed to oblige online-
       distributors to provide their clients with physical copies of the copyright material made
       available for downloading, if they wish so7. Thus the application of the exhaustion principle
       could be restricted to such cases and such physical copies (de lege ferenda), whereas the
       distribution right does not exhaust as regards the downloads themselves.
C.     Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
       In my view the Registration of works and other subject matter (as a prerequisite of protection,
       of a longer protection, or of certain special rights) appears to be a rather bad idea. As a
       precondition of protection such registration is to be discarded, furthermore, with regard to the
       non-formality requirement of the Berne Convention. Though this principle does not apply in
       the country of origin of a work, which – by the way – is rather difficult to be defined in the
       online world8, it is not advisable to return to outdated models.
       If registration may be expedient in special circumstances, as e.g. in the context with orphan
       works, can only be discussed in the context of such special circumstnces. In any case it must
       be taken into consideration that registration would cause considerable costs and could turn out
       to be an obstacle for adequate protection in particular with regard to certain categories of
       works and other subject matter of protection. The failed attempt to establish an international
       register for cinematographic works may serve as an example.
D.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
       No comments on account of missing experience.
E.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?
       In my view the term of protection of seventy years pma as set out in the Term-Directive
       (1993/2006/2011) still appears to be adequate irrespective of the fact that the expectancy of
       life further increased since the adoption of the Term-Directive in 1993. This holds true also
       with regard the extension of the term of protection for producers of phonograms and
       performing artists whose presentations are fixed on phonograms (in the strict sense), since the
       extension from 50 years to 70 eventually was moderate und now prevents performing artists
       from seeing their recordings falling in the public domain at a time when they were still alive.
       Only marginally: The comparable long duration of protection for copyright works does not
       play any role in practice as far as works are concerned, which ceased to be in demand ‘on the
       market’.




7    Such copies must, of course be compatible with electronic reading devices for e-books.
8    See ALAI (2012), Determination du pays d’origine lorsqu’une œuvre est divulguée publiquement pour la premiere
     fois sur internet (Jørgen Blomqvist, Mihály Ficsor, Ysolde Gendreau, Jane Ginsburg, Silke von Lewinski, Delia
     Lipszyc, Antoon Quaedvlieg, Sam Ricketson, Paolo Spada et Michel Walter. To be found at:
     http://www.alai.org/assets/files/resolutions/pays-origine.pdf).
                                                       -6-



      However, it could be discussed to extend the prolongation of protection also to other related
      rights than those for producers of phonograms and performing artists, since it may be argued
      that there is a considerable conflict of valuation. However, performing artists should be in the
      fore, since their artistic achievements are most likely comparable with those of authors.
      If eventually a shortening of the terms of protection should be taken into consideration, it
      should in any case be discussed to organize such curtailing of the terms in the form of domain
      public payant as far as the period of shortening is concerned, as was proposed by Adolf Dietz
      for the extension of the terms in 19939.


III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
A.    Access to content in libraries and archives
1.    Preservation and archiving
      Preservation and archiving activities (of libraries, museums and archives etc) are a legitimate
      concern, which may be discussed. However, in my view such exceptions should be discussed
      and provided for on the national level rather than on the European, which did provide the
      framework for such measures already in the Infosoc-Directive. Most national legislations thus
      already provide for respective exceptions as this is the case e.g. in Austria10.
      As far as measures are concerned, which go beyond preservation activities and aim at
      archiving and harvesting of publicly available web content, such measures should be rendered
      possible in amending Article 5 para 2 lit c of the Infosoc-Directive. It must be taken into
      consideration that such publicly available web content may be put on the net only temporarily.
      All details, however, should be reserved to licensing agreements concluded between collective
      management organisations and the respective users. To make sure that such general
      agreements allow archiving and harvesting of publicly available web content irrespective of
      the repertory of collection society concerned, such general agreements should be applicable
      also to non-members (third party effect).
      In any case such use must be dependent upon the payment of an equitable remuneration („fair
      compensation“). Such remuneration may be assured in upholding exclusive rights and in the
      same time providing for mandatory collective management. With this regard see the example
      set out in Article 9 of the Satellite-Cable Directive.
2.    Off-premises access to library collections
      The Off-premises access to library collections should strictly be reserved to license
      agreements. In no case exceptions or limitations should be taken into consideration. Such
      exceptions are not considered to be just and reasonable from the point of view of rightholders,
      since they would be of an direct impact on the normal exploitation of copyright material. Such
      exceptions, therefore, would in no case comply with the Three-Step-Test as set out in Article
      5 para 5 of the Infosoc-Directive and in International Copyright.
3.    E-lending


9 Das Urheberrecht in der Europäischen Gemeinschaft (SchrR Europäische Wirtschaft 91) (1978).
10 See for instance § 42 para 7 of the Austrian Copyright Act.
                                                  -7-



      This holds true with regard to E-lending as well. Exceptions and limitations in this case are
      not reasonable. If this issue should be further discussed, the Rental- and Lending Right
      Directive would have to be completely revised and the interests of authors as well as
      publishers safeguarded in particular as regards the impact on primary exploitation.
4.    Mass digitization
      The mass digitization of copyright material in my view is to be restricted to temporary web-
      content and to books out of print, for which the Memorandum of Understanding has already
      set out the guidelines. Some Member States have already provided for special provisions. This
      issue may dealt with by the Austrian legislature on the occasion of implementing the Orphan
      Works Directive still in 2014. As this is mentioned in the Consultation paper also with this
      regard a collective management in combination with third party effect of general agreements
      may be worthwhile to be discussed. However, the details should be left to the national
      legislature of the Member States.
B.    Teaching
      The wording of the exception as set out in Article 5 para 3 lit a Infosoc-Directive is wide and
      leaves considerable leeway to the national legislature of the Member States with regard to this
      non-mandatory exception. Since exceptions may be provided in the context with the
      reproduction right and distribution right as well as with the making available right, in my view
      this provision does not need to be extended with regard to ‘distance teaching’ and ‘home-
      studies’. In any case such exceptions should be left to the national legislature as well.
      Since the exception as set out in the Infosoc-Directive is restricted to non-commercial
      institutions, it could be made clear that such provisions may be applied to commercial
      enterprises (class book-publishers etc) as well on the condition that such exploitation must be
      carried out on the grounds of an (upheld) exclusive right rendered flexible through mandatory
      collective management (with third party effect) as this is the case already in Austria11.

D.    Text and data mining
      A precondition to text and data-mining is the mass digitization of copyright material. It
      substitutes to a large extent the physical reading of big quantities of texts and possibly also the
      understanding of (new) interrelations. Such search activities as such could be discussed to be
      rendered free by means of a strictly circumscribed (new) exception, if this should no be the
      case already with regard to existing exceptions and limitations.
      In this context the ECJ in its „Infopaq I“-judgment12 already has made clear that the storing
      (printing) of short parts of (literary) works13 may be of relevance from the point of view of
      copyright, and would not be covered by the transient and incidental copying exception either,
      since such copies are deemed to be permanent and not temporary. If the copyright material,
      however, is scanned and the texts searched by means of a search engine without being print


11 See § 59c of the Austrian Copyright Act.

       out, such data mining in the European Court’s opinion is covered by the exception of Article 5
       para 1 of the Infosoc-Directive14; according to the Court this holds true even if the scanning is
       carried out by hand. This judgment may be disputed for two reasons: First, is appears
       questionable whether such procedure indeed is deemed to be a ‘technical process’; second, the
       court did not deal with the question of deleting the scans immediately after the completion of
       specific search procedure.
       Since the scanning and permanent storing of texts and data is a precondition for the reasonable
       functioning of data mining procedures, the storing would have to be permanent, which is in no
       case covered by the mentioned exception for transient or incidental copies. Thus the enabling
       of such activities – in my view exclusively in favour of scientific research and in no case for
       commercial purposes – through amending the existing exceptions would be necessary as well
       as the providing of a „fair compensation“for rightholders. Here again, a system of upheld
       exclusive rights in combination with mandatory collective management with third party effect
       appears to be preferable, because the differing situations and interests are dependent upon
       specific cases, which could be taken into consideration only through licencing-contracts
       agreed upon by the involved parties.

E.     User-generated content
1.     As far as User-Generated Content so-called is concerned, first and foremost it should be made
       clear that the single end-user as well as internet-platforms, operators of social networks and
       the like are liable for possible copyright infringements jointly and severally. In view the
       opinion put forth, according to which internet-platforms only are to be understood as host-
       providers and, therefore, not liable for the copyright material made available through their
       services in principle, cannot be agreed with. Because it is not the end-user who makes such
       content available to the public in uploading the material to the platform, but rather the
       platform that is carrying out the restricted act of making available. It is worthwhile noting in
       this context that in copyright the situation is far different from that in trademark cases or other
       intellectual property rights.
       Furthermore, also Article 14 of the E-Commerce-Directive only alludes to the reproduction
       right and in no way to the making available right15.
       In any event moral rights as well as the adaptation right must be strictly reserved to
       rightholders. This all the more, since moral rights are not at all dealt with in the European
       copyright related Directives.
2.     However, it may be worthwhile discussing the rendering the licensing of UGC (containing
       copyright material of third parties) easier for end-users. In this context as well a mandatory
       collective management (with third party effect) might be a reasonable solution.
3.     With regard to moral rights, which have not been dealt with on the level of Union law so far,
       it appears to be worthwhile to reconsider the reluctance of the EU legislature with this respect.

14 See ECJ 17 January 2011 C-302/10 – „Infopaq II“ MR-Int 2014/1 (Walter) = GRUR Int 2012, 336 = ZUM 2012,
   398 = MMR 2013, 45.
15 Article 14 para 1 of the EC-Directive reads as follows:
   ‘Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient
   of the service … ’.
                                                   -9-



      It may be noted in this context that according to the jurisprudence of the ECJ the provisions of
      the Berne Convention dealing also with moral rights (Article 6bis) already actually form part of
      Union law, since the substantial provisions of the Berne are to be applied pursuant to article 1
      para 4 of the WCT to which the EU is a party. Furthermore, the differences between the
      differing concepts of the Member States first and foremost concern the duration of moral
      rights, which could be left to the national legislature of the Member States.
4.    This holds true with respect to the adaptation right as well, which only is alluded to in the
      Computer Program-Directive.


IV.   Private copying and reprography
1.    General Remark
      As to private copying and reprography it must be noted that there are rather different
      situations to be taken into consideration with this regard. The reproduction on paper (Article 5
      para 2 lit a of the Infosoc-Directive) may cause different possible problems than is the case
      with regard to private copying (Article 5 para 2 lit b of the Infosoc-Directive). As far as both
      situations are concerned it is to be noted that the ECJ’s jurisprudence already solved a series
      of problems. However, there are still questions to be solved on the EU level.
2.    The notion of ‘damage’ in the ‘Padawan’ case
      As regards the judgment in the case „Padawan“ it is to be mentioned that the allusion made by
      the Court to the notion of ‘damage’ inflicted on the rightholders by the (legitimate) copying
      for private use, is only one aspect to be taken into consideration. In my view this aspect should
      not be overemphasized and must in no case be understood in the strict sense of the word as the
      real ‘damage’ occurred by private copying. In any event, apart from such damage, also the
      aspect of remunerating the (free) use (legitimately) made of works or other subject matter is
      decisive.


3.    The ‘illegitimate source’ problem
(a)   As to downloads from illegitimate sources (platforms or ‘peer2peer’ networks) of whatever
      kind, it may be argued with good reasons that private copying from such platforms or
      ‘peer2peer’ networks is illegitimate itself (problem of the legitimate source). There will be
      soon shed light into this question through the jurisprudence of the ECJ16. According to the
      opinion of the Advocate General Pedro Cruz Villalón dated 9 January 2014 in the case „ACI
      Adam/Thuiskopie“ the legitimacy of the source is a precondition for private copying.
      However, on the other hand, the Advocate General in this procedure held that the claim to
      ‘fair compensation’ only serves as compensation for legitimate private copying. As a
      consequence Article 14 of the Enforcement Directive is not applicable either since in the case
      of ‘fair compensation’ there is no enforcement of intellectual property in the strict sense.
(b)   If the Court should follow this opinion, which will presumably be the case, this leads to the
      consequence that on the one hand such infringements may not be prosecuted in practice or at

16 See preliminary procedure initiated by the Nederlandse Hoge Raad by judgment of 26 September 2012 – „ACI
   Adam/Thuiskopie“ C-435/12.
                                                 - 10 -



      least only with considerable difficulties and on the other hand not even a claim to a ‘fair
      compensation’ being due. With this regard, in my opinion, the argument of ‘double payment’
      is not convincing, since the equitable remuneration is minim and could be deducted from a
      possible damage, if a suing for copyright infringement in fact should be carried out. It follows
      from the aforesaid that it should be made clear in Article 5 para 3 lit a) und b) that a ‘fair
      compensation’ must be due also as regards illegitimate copying for one’s own use (lit a) or
      one’s private use (lit b).
(c)   Only marginally: As to reproductions on other material than paper the Austrian Copyright Act
      provides for claims to an equitable remuneration („fair compensation“) also in other cases
      than private use on the grounds of other exception (e.g. libraries).
4.    The national systems of ‘fair compensation’
(a)   It appears to be evident that the definite use of ‘blank tapes’ or other storing material (CDs,
      DVDs, mini-disks, external and internal computer hard disks, USB-Sticks, memory cards or
      whatever storage medium) and/or devices often cannot be assessed at the time, when such
      material or devices are brought on the market by producers or importers. In Austria, therefore,
      the Act as well as the practice of the competent collecting society (austro-mechana) efficiently
      works on a twofold basis: First no compensation is collected if the producer or importer
      furnishes prima facie evidence that the media will be used for purposes other than private
      copying or other copying permitted by the Act. Second, persons who bought blank media for
      which the „fair compensation“ already was paid have a claim to reimbursement against the
      competent collecting society.
      In my view, this system is fully in compliance with Union Law as was confirmed in principle
      by the ECJ recently17, taken over by the French legislature18 already in 2011, and could serve
      as a model for other Member States’ legislation as well as for a possible harmonization on the
      EC level. On the other hand the shifting of the duty of payment to retailers, as was proposed
      by the Vitorino Mediation Report of 31 January 2013, appears to be as well inefficient as
      burdensome for all parties (collecting societies as well as thousands of retailers).
5.    Trans-border delivery
      As to trans-border deliveries of media or devices the ECJ (‘amazon’ case) already has made
      clear the „fair compensation“ is to be paid in the country of definitive use (target/import
      country). Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the legislation of the ‘export county’ is to
      provide for a reimbursement of the remuneration already paid. It may be worthwhile
      discussing whether this obligation of the legislator in the Member States should be enshrined
      explicitly in the Infosoc-Directive in order to prevent ‘double payment’.


V.    Fair remuneration of authors and performers
1.    Exceptions and limitations


17 See ECJ 27 Juni 2013 C-521/11 austro mechana/Amazon Gesellschaften17 [2013] MR 172 (M Walter) = [2013]
   ecolex 337, 812 (A Anderl) = [2013] GRUR 1025 = [2013] GRUR Int 949 = [2013] EuZW 741 = [2013] CRi 632
   = [2013] ÖBl 69, 283 = [2013] ZUM 780 = [2013] ZIR 378 (Sascha Jung/Georg Streit).
18 Loi du 20 Décembre 2011.
                                                    - 11 -



(a)   In my view the catalogue of exceptions and limitations should be reviewed in order to add the
      obligation of providing for a ‘fair compensation’ for one or the other case, as this is the case in
      Article 5 para 2 lit a) und b) with regard to copying for one’s own use on paper (lit a) and
      private copying (lit b). Hence in particular in regard of free use for educative purposes and/or
      libraries, archives etc such compensation should be rendered mandatory.
(b)   If other cases of exceptions and limitations should be taken into consideration than already set
      in Article 5 of the Infosoc-Directive, such claim to a „fair compensation“ should be provided
      for as well. Of course, this would be dependent upon the special case at issue.
2.    Mandatory collective management and third party effect
(a)   With this regards it could be made clear that Member States are allowed to establish exclusive
      rights, which in special cases only may be claimed by collecting societies representing also
      rights and claims for third parties (non-members). This system, as was already alluded to
      several times above, appears to be in line with Union Law as well as more practicable than
      mere claims to an equitable remuneration.
(b)   Only marginally it may be worthwhile noting that the Austrian Copyright Act as early as 1936
      already had introduced such system19 and thus anticipated the Swedish ‚school model‘ as well
      as the system established by the Satellite-Cable Directive.


VI.   Respect of rights
1.    Claim for information
      The respect of rights is a rather important issue, since the enforcement has turned out to be
      rather difficult – if at all possible – in the digital environment. In my view in the first line
      Article 8 of the Enforcement Directive should be amended and explicitly stated that internet
      providers (intermediaries) mandatorily are to store such data for a certain period of time (e.g.
      six month), which are necessary to fulfil their obligation to render information as regards
      infringers using their services. Furthermore it should clearly be stated that providers are
      allowed to process personal traffic data for this purpose, irrespective of the protection of
      personal data. This should be made clear in regard of civil procedures as well as with respect
      to criminal procedures.
2.    The obligation under Article 8 para 3 of the InfoSoc-Directive
      Furthermore it may be worthwhile discussing which measures must be taken by access-
      providers in order to comply with their obligation to prevent copyright infringements by
      persons using their services according to Article 8 para 3 of the Infosoc-Directive. For the
      time being, however, the outcome of the preliminary proceeding in the case „kino-to“20 will
      have to be waited for.
3.    Liability of internet-platforms and organizers of social media
      As was already mentioned above, internet platforms of whatever kind must be liable for the
      copyright material made available by them. In my view the opinion, according to which such

19 § 59 in regard of public broadcasting reception.
20 Case C-314/12. See opinion of the Advocate General Cruz Villalón dated 26 November 2013.
                                                        - 12 -



      platforms are deemed to be host providers, is incorrect at least as far as copyright and related
      rights infringements are concerned. It must be emphasized in this context that intellectual
      property rights must not necessarily be treated on a par; in particular copyright and related
      rights are to be regarded as a special kind of intellectual property.


VII. A single EU Copyright title
      In my view time is not yet ripe for an unitary copyright title. First and foremost the acquis
      communautaire should be further developed and amendments taken into consideration as
      described above. As already mentioned above a unitary copyright title has nothing to do with
      the question of territorial splitting of licences and is, therefore, not a precondition of a
      (cautious) regulation of this question. Furthermore, the leeway given to the national legislature
      also may serve as a field of experimentation in particular in relation to new (technical or
      commercial) developments21.




Thank me the opportunity to submit my view in regard of the questions raised in the Consultation
Paper.
