                             Public Consultation
                   on the review of the EU copyright rules

                                5 March 2014



Background

The Association of Authors’  Agents  (AAA)  is  a  British  voluntary  trade
association whose members are all United  Kingdom-based  literary  agencies.
The AAA’s membership comprises the majority of literary  agencies  operating
in the UK, and by consequence a significant majority of the  UK’s  published
authors, a client base that is a  significant  driver  in  the  UK  creative
economy.

The AAA is also the largest organisation of its  kind  in  Europe,  and  its
member agents and agencies are devoted to promoting authors’ works  in  both
domestic and global markets and to defending  authors’  rights  in  the  UK,
abroad  and  on-line.  Works  by  the  AAA’s  agencies’  clients   are   all
distributed or published in Europe, whether in English language editions  or
under licence for publication in translation in member states.

AAA members are actively engaged in publishing and other forms  of  creative
intellectual  property  licensing  across  Europe,  with  the  authors   its
agencies  represent  contributing  to  Europe’s   cultural   diversity   and
providing content for licensing and sale across member states, thus  helping
drive local creative economies and providing choice for  European  consumers
across all territories and languages.

While the AAA is delighted to be involved in such a consultation, its  views
on the matter could be summarised as follows:

    •  we do not believe that the questions that  have  been  posed  in  the
      consultation are necessarily the most  appropriate  questions  as  our
      comments below should make clear

    •  the  UK  has  already  made  significant  steps  toward  streamlining
      copyright  licensing  and  enforcement,  in  the  digital  age,  which
      dovetail with effective provisions at the European level,  we  do  not
      need further changes to European copyright legislation

    • in a recent consultation undertaken by the UK’s Intellectual  Property
      Office, we asserted that while  there  has  been  greater  recognition
      given recently of the contribution of the creative industries  in  the
      UK, we agree with the conclusion of the UK’s Culture, Media and  Sport
      Committee that ‘the extraordinary success’  of  the  these  industries
      ‘may be jeopardised by any dilution of  intellectual  property  rights
      and the failure to tackle online piracy’. This holds just as true at a
      European level.

    • we believe that reopening the debate and looking at the  EU  Copyright
      Directive again would destabilise the situation and time must be given
      for those industries dependent on copyright within EU Member States to
      adapt to the changes  already  made  and  to  continue  to  invest  in
      structures that will help them develop and prosper.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]





   1.  [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?





NO – and this question presupposes that legitimate access is  a  problematic
procedure; many online content services can  be  accessed  successfully  and
legitimately throughout Europe





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?





NO – as above





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.





Every licence issued by a UK literary agent is  a  multi-territory  licence,
and clearly and simply sets out the terms and conditions for supply  of  the
work  in  question  in  each  territory  and  format  in  question.  British
publishing deals  have  historically  involved  licences  for  international
publication,  whether  through  distribution  and  sublicensing,  throughout
British Commonwealth territories;  the  Single  Market  means  that  a  work
published in the  United  Kingdom  also  means  it  is  available  for  sale
throughout the EU. A licence may include the  right  to  sublicense  into  a
foreign language or outside the EU or  British  Commonwealth,  depending  on
the commercial negotiations  surrounding  a  deal  and  the  wishes  of  the
creator.





AAA members arrange  many  hundreds  of  thousands  of  licences  for  their
clients each year and it would be impossible to enumerate a specific  total.
The majority of AAA members’ clients have engaged their agent’s services  to
market and arrange licences for print and  digital  publication  of  written
work, but other rights and formats licensed will also  include  exploitation
of original intellectual property for – but not be limited  to  –  film  and
television adaptation, audio  book,  sound  broadcast,  other  entertainment
formatting, merchandise and gaming.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?





We have not encountered problems and believe  the  current  system  provides
clear conventions and straightforward self-regulating  mechanisms  for  both
the rights holder and the consumer’s benefit.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?





This is a question that is framed in such a way that either a YES  or  a  NO
answer could apply. Under the YES category,  there  are  varying  commercial
parameters to every licence negotiated. An agent  works  to  ensure  that  a
client’s work is licensed to the most suitable and effective partner in  any
given territory, to ensure that  the  work  will  be  properly  distributed,
exploited and otherwise made available  in  each  territory,  and  that  the
client is reasonably compensated for  such  distribution  and  exploitation.
However, in the NO category, a licence in any  one  language  with  any  EU-
based publisher will always be a Europe-wide licence, and AAA  members  work
effectively and positively within Single Market conditions.





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?





NOT APPLICABLE





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?





NO – the current system is  effective  and  governed  by  a  self-regulating
commercial marketplace successfully operating within the parameters  of  the
Single Market





Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]



The act of “making available”


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?





YES – see answers to 5 and 7 above




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?





YES – while we avowedly  believe  that  existing  copyright  provisions  and
conventions are fit for purpose in the  digital  age,  and  provide  for  an
appropriate balance between authors’ rights and needs and  the  benefit  for
the consumer, licences that have boilerplate  wording  or  definitions  that
were conceived prior to  the  advent  of  digital  commerce  may  allow  for
loopholes and ambiguity in interpretation that are neither to  the  consumer
nor the author’s advantage – for instance, when considering  the  definition
of a ‘sale’ vs a ‘licence’ in various forms of digital  distribution,  which
under commercial conventions could have very different implications for  the
author’s remuneration. HOWEVER any  such  ‘clarification’  would  need  very
careful drafting, and the guiding principle of  such  a  process  should  be
clarification and not redefinition.  It  is  the  AAA’s  view  that  in  the
majority of instances  the  current  system  and  conventions  operate  very
effectively.





Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


  10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?





NO – this question presupposes that there is a problem. There is no problem
with the need to apply two rights to one act of exploitation – it is a
process that happens on an ongoing basis and the industry is used to
managing this process. The problem actually comes with oversimplifying the
process and, as in 9 above, not recognising that there are indeed two
rights to consider here.





Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


YES – An author’s approval  must  be  sought  prior  to  publication;  links
should therefore only be provide to sites where  such  permission  has  been
granted. The conflation of functional/mechanical  roles  –  where  accessing
displayed information can imply publication within the user’s  cache  etc  –
make this only more important. The hyperlink becomes part  of  a  publishing
process. However, the main issue here is not whether  the  hyperlink  should
be subject to approval but that no copyright  material  should  posted  that
has not been licensed for such posting.







  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?





YES – but as above





Download to own digital content

  13.  [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?





NO – this is an illegal act and antithetical to our sector’s business  model
and the interests of authors, who require compensation for  sales  in  order
to be able to undertake creative work.





  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.





It would fundamentally undermine the economics of  the  publishing  industry
and the creative  economy.  The  question  mistakenly  presupposes  workable
parallels between conventions around the sale of and the inherent  qualities
of print/physical editions and digital editions. A  digital  copy  does  not
become ‘used’ or degraded in the same way as a physical copy; geography  and
distribution logistics means that re-sale of physical copies  is  inherently
limited. Further, if owners of digital copies  are  permitted  or  otherwise
able to make copies for re-sale  or  other  circulation  then  that  digital
owner becomes a publisher or distributor in their own  right,  but  with  no
compensation back to the creative or the publisher  which  has  invested  in
developing or marketing the work.





We know that other  respondents  to  this  survey  from  our  sector  –  for
instance the UK Publishers’ Association – are responding to this point  very
cogently and we would refer you to their answers. Suffice it to say that  we
would be implacably opposed to the introduction of such  a  framework  which
would make it impossible for creators to  earn  money  from  the  fruits  of
their labour and make the role of the publisher  financially  unviable.  The
present system nurtures a plurality of publishing operations across the  EU,
and fosters dynamic and  expanding  publishing  activities  in  each  member
state, making for both  a  valuable  commercial  component  to  the  Union’s
economy and for rich cultural diversity.





Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?





NO – not necessary. The ISBN system operates globally; the UK is already
exploring its own copyright hub and there would be no need for duplication
of effort. Further Article 5 of the Berne Convention asserts the inviolable
principle of copyright being established from the moment of creation and
nothing should be done that could call that into question – for instance,
whether formally or informally – it becoming considered that if a work was
not registered it was not protected to the full extent of the law.





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?





There would be none.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?





Extremely onerous and costly set-up and management costs with room for
significant margins of error. See also answers at 15 above.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?





The existing provisions under law should in any event prevail.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?





The EU should be guardian of best practice, encouraging use of the existing
ISBN and local (eg UK Copyright Hub) identifying systems. The EU should
seek to protect the interests of creators, and thus the long-term interests
of consumers in terms of the creation of new works and in the fostering of
a thriving creative economy.








Term of protection – is it appropriate?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?




YES – no recent market or technological developments have arisen that mean
that an author’s interest in their work should not last for their lifetime
and for the lifetime of the first generation of their
dependents/descendants.





 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?




NO – each territory reviews and implements exceptions that  arise  from  the
needs of its own market and citizens. Exceptions work  for  certain  ‘public
benefit’ purposes, which will vary  according  to  local  users,  and  while
distinct  from  commercial  concerns  are  defined  in   consultation   with
commercial stakeholders.


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?




NO – see answer to 21 above.






  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.





No opinion – not aware of the details of this work in progress





  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?




NO – the present system seems to  be  effective,  but  no  local  exceptions
should be set up in such a way as  to  provide  loopholes  for  exploitation
outside the very specific situation the exception sought to resolve.





  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

Not applicable


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?




NO – see 24 above





  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)



A whole suite of interests would have to be addressed – including  those  of
licensees and retailers.




Access to content in libraries and archives



Preservation and archiving





  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?




NO




29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


We don’t see problems. It is perfectly  reasonable  and  straightforward  to
access  rightsholders,  and  a  process  of  tracking   of   orphan   works
rightsholders or licensing orphan works is already under way in the UK.


  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?


To reinforce access to orphan works clearance systems.

  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


Not applicable.




Off-premises access to library collections



  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?





The piloting of several e-lending schemes is under way  in  the  UK  and  we
would reserve any comment  until  such  time  as  those  findings  are  made
available.



  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




Through market-based solutions, not exceptions.




  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?


See above.



  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


Not applicable.



E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

See answer to 32 above.

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Ditto

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?



Ditto

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?


We support the library as a physical community resource, promoting  literacy
and access to the printed word. Distance lending should not  be  set  up  in
such a way as to undermine the  physical  cultural  ‘hub’  function  of  the
library,  which  should  be  equally  fostered.  E-lending  should  only  be
implemented in such a way as not to undermine the  publishing  economy  that
facilitates the creation of these works in  the  first  place.  And  authors
should be compensated for loans  through  licences  and/or  a  micropayments
system via a publisher or  specialist  retailer,  analogous  with  the  UK’s
Public Lending Right system for physical  loans,  and  licences/facilitation
of loans should fairly reflect the needs of all parties.




Mass digitisation


  40.  [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?





NO – no further legislation should be necessary to make sure that the
provisions of the 2011 legislation is upheld.





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?





NO OPINION





Teaching




  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?




NO


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?



Not applicable



  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?



Various collective licensing provisions.



  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?


Not applicable

  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?





Not applicable






Research


  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?




NO




  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?



Not applicable

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?




Not applicable





Disabilities




  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?


NO – appropriate measures are already in place in the UK




  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?



As above



  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?




Not applicable





Text and data mining

  53.   (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer   or   an
      institutional  user:]  Have  you  experienced  obstacles,  linked   to
      copyright, when trying to use text or data mining  methods,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?




NO – again this question presupposes the negative.  Copyright  protects  the
creator of reliable databases; removal of protection will  reduce  incentive
to invest time in developing resources of quality.


  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




Not applicable



  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

Not applicable

  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?





Not applicable.


  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?




Not applicable





User-generated content


  58.  (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?





YES – however, while AAA member agencies and their clients have  experienced
problems it has generally been  found  that  recourse  is  sufficient  under
existing law. Our concern is how easily this  work  can  be  undertaken  and
disseminated already, often resulting in  the  derogatory  treatment  of  an
original work or undermining the existing work’s commercial appeal,  so  any
new legislation that sought to facilitate this type of creative  work  could
exacerbate an already sensitive situation.





  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?





YES – initiatives under way with the UK IPO may lead  to  a  more  effective
electronic ‘tagging’ mechanism for text, and there  are  increasing  studies
being taken industry-wide about effective use of metadata.





  60. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
      holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to be  remunerated
      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?





YES – (a) where this relates to online piracy





  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?





Effective anti-piracy portals and piracy reporting  systems,  a  requirement
for swift takedown, cooperation of service providers to  ensure  that  users
are not encouraged to break the law and piracy is not fostered





  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?


No opinion


  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?



No opinion






  IV. Private copying and reprography


  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography exceptions  in  the
      digital environment?




NO – existing provisions suffice


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?




NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?




Not applicable




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?




NO OPINION





  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?




NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).



Not applicable


  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?



Not applicable


  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?





Not applicable





   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?



There are long-established mechanisms  for  negotiating  licences  with,  in
general, an advance/guarantee against earnings and ongoing  royalty  payment
structure that ensures  compensation  for  the  creative  and  a  sufficient
commercial  margin  for  publisher  and  retailer.  This  does  not  require
legislation to improve or finesse it.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?




NO – there are established avenues of negotiation within the  industry,  and
recourse within national law in the event of unfair practices.


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?


Not applicable




  VI. Respect for rights

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?




YES – in particular  we  recommend  that  the  cross  order  application  of
Article 8 (3) InfoSoc Directive and Article 11 (1) Enforcement  Director  be
seriously considered by the Commission. These provisions are the  basis  for
effective S 97A actions in the UK; the creative economies across  EU  member
states would be far better served were enforcement fully implemented.


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?




NO – while as stated above the Directive does not  need  re-opening,  useful
clarifications can be made.





As mentioned previously, Notice and Take Down  measures  need  reinforcement
and to be made more binding, and for the EU  to  be  the  guardian  of  best
practice. Legislation should not be used by infringing parties  as  a  means
of devising new ways of enacting piracy but  be  measures  that  engender  a
response of ceasing and desisting. And search engines need to be  encouraged
to help uphold the law and not propagate  or  foster  access  to  infringing
sites.



  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?




NO – see response to 76 above. ‘User-generated content’  creatives  seem  to
lack an understanding that derivative works need to acknowledge and  respect
the rights of the original creator; and when ISPs and search engines turn  a
blind eye to copyright infringement we move rapidly  towards  a  destructive
cycle of deregulation and promotion of ignorance of the law.





 VII. A single EU Copyright Title


  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?




NO




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?





Not applicable – see other recommendations to the EU above








VIII. Other issues


  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.
