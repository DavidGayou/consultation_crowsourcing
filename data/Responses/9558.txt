    II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).



1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.
2
   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  3
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
    NO
    NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
As collecting society we are granting multi-territorial multi-repertoire licences
concerning different forms of Webcasting, Simulcasting, Podcasting and archives of
Broadcasts. We have approximately 80 non commercial and commercial licences in
place and about 50 requests per year concerning a multi-territorial licence. But most of
multi-territorial licences are granted from the rightsowners directly.

  For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing a single
title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                             4
Record companies are regularly asked and they regularly grant, directly or via collective
management organizations representing their rights, EU-wide cross-border licences for
the rights of sound recordings. Record companies encourage services to launch as soon
as possible and in as many countries as possible.
As presented during the European Commission’s “Licences for Europe” initiative and
its working groups, over the last years, the music industry has revolutionized itself, and
Europe is becoming the principal creative centre for the music business globally.
European digital music market has grown considerably in the past few years (from €200
million in 2004 to €1.2 billion in 2012), and increased significantly in its variety. Such
growth was enabled through multi-territory licenses and global support.
Digital music services have achieved incredible scale in a short period, also in Europe.
Now there are 267 services available in Europe, ranging from pay-per-transaction
services to subscription services, including freemium ad-supported services, and they
are growing. Five major music services – iTunes, Deezer, 7Digital, Youtube, MySpace –
are already available everywhere in Europe. Spotify is available in 25 European
countries, and other services are available everywhere or almost everywhere in Europe
too: XBoxMusic is rolling out in all 27 countries, Rara in 20 countries, eMusic in 25
countries, GooglePlay in 10 countries, and they continue to expand. In fact, many of the
leading online and digital services, such as Spotify, Deezer, Last.FM, 7digital, are
European. These services rely on the protection of copyright to develop their businesses.
The music sector is a major actor in this cultural economy and in particular shows a
high percentage of youth employment and highly skilled jobs which are crucial drivers
of competitiveness in today’s difficult economic environment.
Digital music services offer over 30 million tracks available to all European consumers,
and repertoire continues to grow.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
The services’ choice to roll-out on a country-by-country basis, is not due to copyright,
but reflects the diversity of European culture and markets. The crucial problem – online
piracy – should be addressed by applying more efficient enforcement measures and
remedies. See our responses to Questions 75 and 76.


5.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
In issues where we are entitled to licence as a collecting society, we do not have problems
with multi-territorial licences on the basis of reciprocal agreements.

                                                                                           5
Record companies make repertoire available in all markets where they have rights to do
so. The only reasons why rights might not be granted are if the companies do not hold
rights in certain countries. The fact that rights are territorially defined should not be
confused with territorial restrictions. As explained above, record companies license
rights on a cross-border basis.
    NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
    YES – Please explain
    NO – Please explain
The availability of music content across the EU is already a reality, no additional steps
or legislative changes are necessary. Music industry is the most advanced digital content
business in Europe. The European copyright system is based on rights granted to right
holders in each Member State, but this does not preclude the licensing of rights on a
pan-European basis and the growth of legal services across Europe, as explained in our
response to Question 3. The digital music services have been built on the current EU
copyright framework, which shows that the framework is able to support the growth of
the digital economy in the EU.


    NO OPINION



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
8
 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                        6
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES


9
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                                 7
There is no need to clarify the territorial scope of the “making available” right, which
derives from international treaties as well as European law.
The record companies’ rights, including the right of making available, are frequently
licensed on a multi-territory basis, and they have not encountered any practical
difficulties due to possible differences existing in the national rules on
authorship/ownership or transfer of rights.
As regards enforcement of rights, as a matter of practice, litigation takes place where
the infringing act occurs, i.e. in the country where the server is located (where the act of
upload takes place), and in every country where the server / service is accessed by the
members of the public. In many cases national courts confirmed that the act of making
available covered both “upstream” and “downstream” activities, confirming that
making available occurs in the country where the server is located, and in every country
where the server/service is accessed. The introduction of a so-called “country-of-origin”
principle or an “exploitation/targeted public” principle in the EU-wide legislation would
be contrary to these principles and would interfere with the enforcement of rights.
The introduction of a so-called “country-of-origin” principle or an
“exploitation/targeted public” principle in the EU-wide legislation would not improve
the availability of legal services and content, which are already widely offered in Europe
and can create other problems. The “country-of-origin” principle for online licensing,
for instance, would lead to forum-shopping, as also concluded in the Commission’s
Study on the Application of the Information Society Directive (p. 182), and would not
produce any improvement of the current situation, where digital services and content
are widely available across Europe. The “exploitation/targeted public” principle could
be difficult to define due to the lack of the objective criteria to define the concept of the
“exploitation” and “the target of that exploitation”, which, in practice, would be defined
on case-by-case basis, and this could lead to a lot of uncertainty for both right holders
and consumers.
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
     NO
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                               8
There is no practical problem relating to the territorial scope of the making available
right as presented in above answer to question 8.
     NO OPINION

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
     NO
The market solves the licensing of rights adequately, and it will continue to be allowed to
provide pragmatic solutions.
     NO OPINION

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why.
There are different ways of linking and in certain situations, e.g. deep linking, framing,
linking should be subject to authorization of the right holders.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

20
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The main difference to the physical market would be that digital content does not lose
any quality with time and use. This would lead to reduced revenues, because for the
consumer it would not make any difference if he buys a “new” digital music file or a
cheaper “resold” one.
The consequences of enabling the resale of content by means of digital transmissions
have been analysed by the United States Copyright Office in its Section 104 Report
(2001) and, more recently, by a U.S. federal court in Capitol Records v. ReDigi (2012),
and we believe that their conclusions about the impact on the market for creative works
are correct.
Permitting the resale of digital content would inevitably result in reduced revenues for
authors, performers and producers of that content. As the U.S. Copyright Office
concluded in its Report (in language relied upon by the court in Redigi, this quotation is
from the Section 104 Report at pp. 82-83): “Physical copies of works degrade with time
and use, making used copies less desirable than new ones. Digital information does not
degrade, and can be reproduced perfectly on a recipient’s computer. The ‘used’ copy is just
as desirable as (in fact, is indistinguishable from) a new copy of the same work. Time,
space, effort and cost no longer act as barriers to the movement of copies, since digital
copies can be transmitted nearly instantaneously anywhere in the world with minimal effort
and negligible cost. The need to transport physical copies of works, which acts as a natural
brake on the effect of resale on the copyright owner’s market, no longer exists in the realm
of digital transmissions. The ability of such ‘used’ copies to compete for market share with
new copies is thus far greater in the digital world.”
Consumers who, in the past, would not have considered purchasing used phonograms,
books, motion pictures, etc. will be much more likely to make such purchases when: (1)
digital files by their very nature remain in pristine condition so that the used file is of
equal quality to a new file, and (2) such files can be searched for and transmitted
instantaneously, from anywhere on Earth to anywhere on Earth, and at no cost (other
than the cost of purchase).
The likely result would be that, even if total sales for a particular phonorecord, book,
motion picture, etc. did not decline, more and more of those sales would result in
absolutely no revenues to the creators or those works and the price of “original” copies
sold by or with the authorisation of the creators would decline in order to be competitive
with the prices for resale copies. The combination of fewer sales producing revenue for
creators and lower prices on those sales that do produce such revenue would make it
increasingly difficult for individuals and companies to make a living or a profit from the
sale of original content.



                                                                                         11
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The



21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
23
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Allow market activity to shape developments around database interoperability. In some
cases, industry alone can drive developments, as with company databases and data
quality improvements. In some instances a partnership between industry and standards-
setting bodies is more appropriate: for example in the current plans to work with ISO
on revising the ISRC standard.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
The current term of 70 years from publication for a sound recording was only recently
increased to be more in-line with the digital environment and new forms of music
consumption. This is still a shorter term than in many other territories looking to
promote culture and protect creators.
The 70-year term takes into account the longer lives of performers, be they the featured
artist, or also session musicians, and brings the protection more in line with authors,
who benefit from life +70 years protection. A 70-year term for sound recordings ensures
that artists are protected and can earn remuneration later in life, and it also ensures that
artists continue to benefit from their creations. Besides the extended term of protection,

artists can benefit from additional measures provided under the EU law and national
legislation. With the digital music world growing and evolving constantly, new music is
re-digitised and made available to consumers, who often rediscover old classics. This is
breathing new life into old material.
Extra income from term also is directly re-invested in discovering, nurturing and
promoting new musical talent in Europe, ensuring continued cultural diversity as well as
more opportunities for young performers.
It is worth remembering that copyright protection in no way hinders innovation, but
rather rewards it. Having a longer term means only that when a musical work is
exploited, its creators benefit. Copyright protected works are available in many digital
forms (including freemium models), and allow artists to earn a living. Works in the
public domain are also sold digitally in the same manner, the only difference being that
the creator would get nothing.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The exceptions in the EU Copyright legislation are drafted in a flexible way and
accommodate a large variety of digital uses. There is a degree of variation in exceptions
among the Member States due to their optional character, however, in most cases these
variations are of little or no practical consequence. This is due to the fact that the main
exceptions (handicapped, libraries, education, press, quotation) have been implemented
in all Member States. Also, many exceptions (e.g. museums and prisons, repair of
equipment, architectural works, etc) have no cross-border impact.
     NO OPINION


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           15
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
As the Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information Society Directive notes, exceptions
are derogations from the rights of creators, and they need to be applied and interpreted
strictly. The potential need for making some or all exceptions mandatory across Europe
should therefore be duly justified and quantified. The same applies to any further
harmonisation. As mentioned under Question 21, most exceptions are already
implemented in all Member States, and many of them do not even have any cross-
border effects.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Existing exceptions already provide a large degree of flexibility and are able to
accommodate new uses online. For the rest, we believe that licensing solutions are the
most flexible and fastest way to accommodate new digital uses, knowing that many of
these uses have a commercial impact. The music industry is open to discussing ways to
ensure that the market continues to develop in a manner benefiting both consumers and
right holders. This should be done on the basis of clear evidence and economic analysis.
As mentioned above, the need for any new exceptions should be duly justified and
quantified.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The existing exceptions already provide for a large degree of flexibility. Member States
have some room to implement exceptions in a more specific manner, where necessary.
The CJEU provides interpretation of the EU-wide concepts. More flexibility in the form
of an open-ended exception would neither provide legal certainty nor more
harmonisation at EU level. The three-step test should be unchanged, as it is the ultimate
safety net for the right holders and it is a condition for the flexibility of the scope of
certain exceptions listed in the Copyright Directive.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and

                                                                                            16

We have not faced any practical problems because of the territoriality of limitations and
exceptions.


     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Assuming that a particular act has an effect in more than one country and is subject to
an exception that requires compensation, compensation arising from the harm suffered
in each country should be paid to the person or entity that holds the rights in that
particular country, and should be paid by the person whose acts caused the harm in that
country.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

In our view, there is no need for exceptions or limitations, or for any extension of the
existing exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing
schemes should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can
be implemented and adapted faster than legislation.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the

                                                                                           18
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need for exceptions or limitations, also for any extension of the existing
exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes should
be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be implemented
and adapted faster than legislation.
Moreover, there is no need for such exceptions and limitations with respect to music
because access to music is already ubiquitous and inexpensive due to developments in
the marketplace.

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
     NO
E-lending by public institutions could compete directly with legitimate music services
that are offered on a marketplace at various forms and points. Unlicensed E-lending
would provide users with totally substitutable services which would harm normal
commercial exploitation. These activities should be dealt with by the market place and
should be subject to licenses.

libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
                                                                                             20
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
It should be pointed out that when libraries get into the business of making works
available online, they are starting to compete in the areas traditionally governed by the
marketplace, and therefore there is much less justification for exceptions and
limitations.


4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties.
36
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             21

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The rightholders are able to license their content directly; no additional schemes or
mechanisms are needed.
     NO OPINION

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

                                                                                               22
We agree with the conclusions of the authors of the Commission’s Study on the 2001
Information Society Directive that the exception for teaching and research (art. 5.3(a)) is
formulated openly, i.e. e-learning is included in the scope of the exception. The Study
points out that the issue here is that implementing national laws show a restrictive
transposition and diverging conditions. We agree with the opinion expressed in the
Study that the best option to address and solve the divergences would be to require
Member States to meet the aim of the exception, especially when it concerns cross-
border teaching and research.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the most optimal solution; see our response to Question 43.



C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

43
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              25
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
There is no need for exceptions or limitations, also for any extension of the existing
exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes should
be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be implemented
and adapted faster than legislation.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?

45
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

   NO OPINION


LSG will answer the Questions 58-63 together:
UGC should not have the effect that rightholders are not able any more to decide about
the utilization of their works or other subject-matter. It’s not only about the
unauthorised use for economic purposes, but also about moral rights. It’s very
important for the rightholders to have control of the context in which the own work or
other subject-matter is used. Alterations can be unrequested.
The use of pre-existing works and other subject-matter has to be subject to licensing.
Licensing could be carried out directly by the rightholders, licensed UGC platforms or
by collecting societies (like in other cases of mass use i.e. broadcasting or communication
to the public). There is no need for any exceptions or limitations for UGC.
A fact is that Youtube and other social media platforms like Facebook have enormous
financial proceeds, because of copyrightprotected content that is uploaded on these
platforms. Rightholders have to get a fair remuneration for that kind of use.

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies


47
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              29
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions50 in the digital environment?
         – Please explain
        – Please explain
The EU Copyright Directive provides for clear exceptions for copyright and
reprography. The private copying exception, in particular, makes clear that the
exception is limited to individual, non-commercial uses, with no copying by third
parties. We are not aware of problems and case-law relating to the actual scope of the
exception, except for the issue of legal source, which is going to be clarified by the CJEU
in the near future.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?51
         – Please explain
We agree that copies licensed by the right holders should not be subject to private
copying levies. However, where right holders do not exercise their exclusive rights and
effectively license access to and use of their works, any private copies that are made
should be subject to levies, whether or not these copies are made “in the context” of a
licensed service.
In the current environment there are still cases where right-holders cannot license their
right of reproduction for either practical or legal reasons. Today, a large number of
private copies continue to be made from CDs or from online sources on digital devices
and media such as mobile phones, smart phones, MP3 players and PCs, for reasons such
as format shifting, subsequent copies of licensed uses, or as a result of mandatory
private copying exceptions (e.g. France). For these copies, fair compensation must be
provided as foreseen under Article 5(2)b of the EU Copyright Directive whenever a
private copying exception exists under national law.
This has been reinforced by the fact that, for the music sector in the digital environment,
DRMs have been dropped in many cases, due for instance to interoperability issues,
consumers’ opposition, or at the request of the service providers. DRMs make it possible
to limit the use of protected content and to license the uses, including private copying, of

49
   These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-

   Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
51
   This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                           30
that content. The abandonment of DRM systems has therefore reinforced the need for
levies in the digital age.
For the copies that have not been licensed by the right holders and that are made on the
basis of a private copying exception provided in national law, fair compensation must
therefore be granted as foreseen under Article 5.2b of the EU Copyright Directive. And
for doing so private copying levies continue to be an appropriate mechanism to ensure
compensation to copyright holders.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We do not think that levies impact the development of new online services, including
cloud services. A large variety of online services, some of which rely on cloud technology
such as Spotify, Deezer, iTunes Match, have developed in the last years; more services
are emerging, and we do not see levies interfering with such development.
Cloud services in particular, involve for the largest majority the setting up of a database
and the making available of the copies to consumers. These activities require a license
from the right holders, and such licences have been granted to services such as iTunes
Match. Copies made “in the cloud” with such services do not fall under the scope of
private copying and levies.
Conversely, we do not see how a diminution in levies would have any positive impact on
the development of legal services. As explained above, a reduction of levies would only
affect the revenues of the right holders for copies that are anyway not able to license
effectively.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?52
     YES – Please explain
We agree that the cost of the levy could appear on the invoice related to the sales of
products subject to levies. For full transparency and to avoid any misunderstandings,
such an indication should only be displayed if it is accompanied by a clear explanation
about the purpose of the levy (i.e. to compensate the right holders for the copying of
their creations). In addition to transparency, an advantage of the visible levy would be to
help enforce the joint liability of manufacturers, importers and retailers within the sales
chain, as each element of the chain could verify that the levy has been paid upwards.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
We are not aware of cases of double payments. This is probably due to the fact that the
different EU countries have systems of exemptions or refund schemes in the case of
export or transit of products subject to levies.
The Opus judgment of the CJEU (case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus
Supplies, 16 June 2011) recently clarified that, in cases of distant sales occurring from
one EU Member State to consumers located in another EU Member State where a
private copying exception and levies are in place, the distant seller should be liable for
the payment of the levy applicable in the Member State where the consumer is located.
Consequently, it is for the State where right holders suffer from the harm caused by
private copying to ensure the effective recovery of the levy, irrespectively of whether the
media retailer is established in the same State or in another one.
This decision confirmed what is already applying in the offline environment. In our view
the export or exemption schemes can also be applied in the case of online sales of
equipment and devices in order to avoid any possible double payments.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
According to the information we have obtained the current system functions perfectly
and does not lead to any undue payments. Undue payments are avoided by a smart
reimbursement scheme which allows differentiating between private and commercial
users. About one third of all blank media in Austria (including hard discs) are used by
commercial entities. Cross-border transactions are no issue since any importer and
direct seller of blank media in or to Austria has to pay the levy. The importer or direct
seller may obtain reimbursement of a foreign levy from that Member State, in
accordance with the Amazon ruling.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
The CJEU has already clarified a number of important elements, in particular the fact
that levies are an adequate and legitimate way to compensate right holders for the
private copying of protected works, the application of levies in the country of
establishment of consumers, the liability of manufacturers for the payment of levies.
Another decision is expected shortly on the application of legal source for the private
copying exception. In our view, any further issues, if they arise, can be solved by
clarifications from the CJEU, or by national legislation.



     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic

55
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           33
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]


LSG administers mainly rights for record producers and performers. Equitable
remuneration for these rights is split 50:50. This system assures for more than already
four decades that performers and producers are adequately remunerated.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot

be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
The civil enforcement system in the EU and its Member States should be rendered more
efficient, in particular in respect of the following aspects:
- Cross-border injunctions should be allowed. Online piracy cases typically involve a
cross-border element with sites and services being available in more than one country,
or having connection (e.g. operators, ISPs) with multiple jurisdictions. Often right
holders are required to take multiple actions against the same infringing service (e.g.
The Pirate Bay), and there is currently no procedure to enable claims in different
countries to be consolidated in one jurisdiction. One option to remedy this situation is to
allow an injunction against a specific service obtained in one Member State to be
enforced in another Member State, either directly or by way of an expedited procedure.
- Article 8(3) Copyright Directive (which corresponds to Article 11 Enforcement
Directive) should be properly implemented in all European Member States.
- Provisions on injunctive relief should be improved in order to cover subsequent IP/DNS
addresses of infringing websites. For instance, The Pirate Bay has moved domains and
IP addresses a number of times during the course of 2013 which has enabled it to
circumvent the block in some countries where the order obtained did not cover changes
of domain or IP addresses for the sites.
- Provisions on damages should be improved to meet their purpose: (i) right holders have
to be adequately compensated for the loss suffered, and (ii) infringers (and other
potential infringers) have to be deterred.
     NO – Please explain

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           35
The current legal framework is not clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries. We therefore suggest improving the following measures:

- Cooperation required from other intermediaries. All intermediaries in the online
ecosystem (search engines, advertisers and payment providers) should contribute to
curb piracy online. It should be contemplated in the EU legislative framework that all
intermediaries play an important role when it comes to online piracy which means they
bear certain responsibilities in tackling the problem: search engines should stop
directing consumers to infringing content; advertisers/ad networks should stop serving
advertisements to infringing sites that make substantial sums from unlicensed content;
and payment providers should be required to stop providing payment services to illegal
sites and services.

- Protection against liability only for truly neutral intermediaries. Protection against
liability under the E-Commerce safe harbour regime should only apply to “truly neutral
intermediaries”. The most serious problem right holders encounter with notice and
action is that many of the platforms and services seeking to take advantage of the safe
harbours in Article 14 are not properly within the definition of hosting service provider,
nor are they true intermediaries (e.g. unlicensed locker services and BitTorrent sites).
The reality is that many of these services are structurally infringing sites, whose business
model depends on right holders not being able to locate and notify infringing URLs fast
enough before they are re-posted. However, according to ECJ case law and the EU
legislative framework protection against liability can only be granted to “merely
technical, automatic and passive” services – this should be further clarified.

- Requirement for ISPs to keep public databases updated. ISPs should be required to keep
public databases (e.g. Domain Tools, RIPE) updated to allow right holders to identify
which ISP is providing internet service. The vast bulk of the online piracy problem
originates from sites and services in respect of which there is no identified corporate
entity or individual against whom civil litigation can be commenced. The difficulties
which right holders face – beyond the above mentioned lack of a legal method to obtain
the details – are (1) incorrect or fake details, or even no details displayed on public
databases such as the RIPE database or Domain Tools, and (2) incorrect or fake details
held by ISPs. In addition, sites move from one ISP to another very quickly in order to
evade enforcement. Unless ISPs are required to keep public databases accurate and up
to date, right holders are deprived of any means to identify responsible persons behind
infringing services.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain


  NO – Please explain
As a result of the data retention directive in Austria it is not possible to identify the
names and addresses of persons who infringe copyrights in the internet. So there is a


                                                                                         36
complete lack of balance between these rights as copyrights cannot be enforced in all
cases of piracy by endusers like illegal filesharing.
A workable balance between copyright and data protection has to be found at EU level.
The data retention directive does not solve the existing inbalance.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The core legal framework underlying the online music market, in particular the
Copyright Directive which sets out the necessary rights and the protection of technology
in the digital environment, is generally satisfactory, sufficiently harmonised at EU level,
and provides in general an acceptable degree of legal certainty as well as flexibility for
the future. Efforts should concentrate on the proper implementation and enforcement of
this vital framework.
