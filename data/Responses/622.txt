   I. Introduction

A. Context of the consultation
Over the last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content - for
information,  education  or  entertainment   purposes   -   regardless   of
geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy
and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in  2014  on  whether  to
table legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical  industry-  led  solutions  through  the   stakeholder   dialogue
"Licences for  Europe"  on  issues  on  which  rapid  progress  was  deemed
necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[2]. The Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that  two  groups  -
user-generated content and text and data mining - did not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the  legislative
framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on  Content  in  the
Digital Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to  improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement  while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European Council
Conclusions[3] "Providing digital services and content  across  the  single
market requires the establishment of a copyright  regime  for  the  digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of  the  EU
copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to  modernise  Europe's
copyright regime and facilitate licensing,  while  ensuring  a  high  level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings,  in
particular those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[4], the "Green Paper on the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[5] and "Content Online"[6]. These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible  ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to  the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,  distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to
proceed. The "Green Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed  into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to  access  many  online  content  services  from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights - e.g. writers, singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is  limited  to
the territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[7].
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet - e.g.  by
a music streaming service, or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  -  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence,
such that content services can be provided in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights  Management[8]  should  significantly  facilitate  the  delivery  of
multiterritorial licences in musical  works  for  online  services[9];  the
structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for  Europe"[10]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[11].
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them  when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives
of the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the further  development  of  cross-
border portability[12].
Despite progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most  obvious  to
consumers wanting to access services that  are  made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all online  services  are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when  trying  to
access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the  "same"
service is available in all Member  States,  consumers  cannot  access  the
service across borders (they can
only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the  "same"
service in another Member State they are redirected to the  one  designated
for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing  of   rights   in   different
territories. Contractual clauses  in  licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or nonlegislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[13]to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
□ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and  newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

[Open question]

See joint response at Question 7.
5. [In particular if you are a right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries) ?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples

□ NO
□ NO OPINION
See joint response at Question 7.
6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the  necessary
rights for all the  territories  in  question,  you  would  still  find  it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to  a  different
website than the one he is trying to access)?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples

□ NO
□ NO OPINION
See joint response at Question 7.
7. Do you think that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market- led solutions) are needed at EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
□ YES - Please explain


X NO - Please explain
Questions 1 to 6 are addressed to different specific groups of
stakeholders. As mentioned above, our Association does not represent
specifically any of them. At the same time, we are aware of the current
situation regarding those aspects to which these questions seem to refer.
On this basis, we give a negative response to Question 7 (and this is a
direct or indirect response also to Questions 1 to 6) for the following
reasons:
1. The territoriality of copyright and related rights - which must be
maintained - is not a real obstacle to online use of works and objects of
related rights.
2. The present level of harmonization of copyright and related rights and
the scope of exceptions to and limitations of those rights is satisfactory.
3. During the preparation of the Directive on collective management,
serious doubts emerged similar to those which were identified in the
Resolution of the European Parliament adopted on March 13, 2007
(P6_TA/2007/0064) on the 2005 Recommendation on trans-border online
licensing (2005/327/EC). Namely, that the measures foreseen in the draft
directive may undermine cultural diversity (as a result of constraining the
collective management organizations (hereinafter: CMOs) of smaller Member
States with smaller cultural markets to "compete" with much stronger CMOs
of bigger and richer Member States and, at the same time, limiting their
potential to compete. It would be advisable to consolidate the situation in
this respect and not to take similar steps for a while until the cultural,
social and economic consequences of this interference into the cultural
policy of the Member States will have been seen and evaluated.
4. The way copyright and related rights are protected, applied and enforced
is an important element of cultural policy of the Member States (cultural
policy in respect of which - as provided in Article 6(c) of the TFEU - the
EU bodies do not have either exclusive nor shared competence but only the
possibility of supporting, coordinating and supplementing activities). The
maintenance of this sanctuary of the Member States' sovereignty is an
indispensable guarantee of the protection of cultural diversity. Cultural
diversity is both a specific definitional criterion of Europe and a great
advantage in the international cultural markets. Therefore, in this field,
special caution is needed with any attempts at even higher level
transborder harmonization of the protection and exercise of copyright and
related right. While in other fields, such centralizing efforts may really
produce "more Europe," in this respect, such efforts may inevitably lead to
"less Europe", less rich in cultural expressions, productions and services.
5. If certain foreign online services are not available in such a country
as Hungary with a small language market, it is not due to the
territoriality of copyright and related rights, to the status of EU
harmonization, and to the current level of copyright and related rights
protection. It is rather due to the business strategy of the providers of
such services. They tend not to care for such smaller markets. The
adaptation of their systems to the differing language environment and the
establishment of organizational machinery for such markets are not
attractive to them as a matter of sheer cost/benefit analysis. In our view,
it would not be a right reaction to this selective business policy of the
providers of online services to fulfil any of their demands made with the
objective of maximizing their profit with as big ease as possible. It would
not be reasonable to give up our principles laid down in the TFEU about
subsidiarity, proportionality and the cultural sovereignty of Member States
for the sake of their easier profit or for some abstract constraint to make
everything uniform. Instead of this, the competent EU bodies would have to
ensure that, if such providers of cultural services intend to exploit their
repertoire in the EU, they should only be able to do so if they do not


discriminate the smaller cultural markets; if they offer the same services
in different languages for all the Member States under reasonable terms.
Of course, we are away that some of these providers of online services have
obtained strong dominant market and political position. They tend to use
this position ever more frequently to constrain governments to give in to
their demands or give up any kind of modernization of the relevant norms as
a result of which the providers of online services might reduce their
profit margin. Thus, if the EU prescribed equal service for all Member
States as a condition of access to the EU cultural market, they might do
apply their ever more fashionable "negotiation tool": a menace that they
would suspend their services in Europe. However, if they were faced with
the solidarity of the EU Member States duly supported by the competence EU
bodies, they might give up such aggressive blackmailing tactics. They would
hardly consider seriously losing the entire big EU market.
□ NO OPINION

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to
be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in  the
digital environment is largely established by Directive  2001/29/EC[14]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of software[15]
and databases[16].
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[17] which are essential for the transmission of digital copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the  making  of  copies[18],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission - e.g. the uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and
at the users' end - e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights
to authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[19].  These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of "making available"
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload, the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where the  act  of  "making  available"
takes place. This does not raise questions if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of  "making
available" happen in the country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  "targeting"  of  a  certain  Member   State's
public[20]. According to this approach the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted"
by the online service provider. A service provider  "targets"  a  group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language  or  a  currency
specifically targeted at that group.

8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border  situations
— i.e. when content is disseminated across borders — sufficiently clear?

X YES
In the field of copyright, the principle of lex lociprotectionis prevails.
It is laid down in the second sentence of Article 5(1) of the Convention
(to be applied by reference also under the TRIPS Agreement (see Article
9.1) and the WCT (see Article 1(4)): "the extent of protection, as well as
the means of redress afforded to the author to protect his rights, shall be
governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is
claimed" (emphasis added).

As Professor A. Lucas has pointed out in his seminal study prepared for
WIPO on private international law aspects of copyright, the dominant (and,
in our view, correct) interpretation of the expression "the laws of the
country where protection is claimed" is that it means "the laws of the
country for which protection is claimed'" (André Lucas: "Private
International Law Aspects of the Protection of Works and of the Subject
Matter of Related Rights Transmitted through Digital Networks", WIPO
document WIPO/PIL/01/1. Prov., in particular, paragraphs 6 and 31.) In view
of this, the decisive question concerning the applicable law is where the
act covered by a right of authors or owners of related rights takes place.
In the case of infringements, this basically means lex loci delicti
commissi with the possibility of applying certain other supplementary
collision principles. In Hungary, there is consensus that the relevant
provision of the Hungarian Law-Decree 13 of 1979 on private international
law (Article 19) - "Concerning authors' rights, the law of that country
shall apply in the territory of which protection is claimed" - should also
be interpreted in this way.

This means that, under the WCT, in general, the law of that country would
be applicable in which the act of making available takes place. Under
Article 8 of the WCT, Articles 10 and 14 of the WPPT and Article 3(1) and
(2) of the Information Society Directive the act involved is "making
available to the public of [works and subject matter of related rights] in
such a way that member of the public may access them from a place and at a
time individually chosen by them" (emphasis added). On the basis of this
language, the act of "making available" takes place as soon as a work or an
object of related rights is uploaded and becomes accessible for interactive
online uses.


By this, of course, the issue is not completely settled yet, since
different options are available to determine the place of making available
of protected material. It is also necessary to take into account the
realities created by the galloping development of digital online technology
and business methods (now also those which are related to cloud
technology). Furthermore, there is also need to consider certain
alternatives in view of the fact that protected contents may be - and,
unfortunately, frequently are - made available from places where there is
no adequate copyright protection. The criteria of Article 1(2) of the
Satellites and Cable Directive may hardly be applied here directly.
However, the underlining principle - following from the private
international law context - that the most relevant and workable collision
criteria related to the act in question should be applied is relevant here
too (possible candidates: the top-level domain name used by the "content
provider", the country of registration or headquarters or place of real
business activity, etc., of the "content provider"). Supplementary criteria
would also be needed where the criteria linked to EU Member States could
not be applied (because all possible relevant places would be outside the
Union). This would be an appropriate issue for EU harmonization, and the
provisions and "preparatory work" of the Satellites and Cable Directive
clearly show that this is hardly a matter just for the CJEU. The possible
regulation of these issues would require the participation and decision of
the EU bodies that are responsible for law making in the EU (taking into
account the views and legitimate interests of all the interested
stakeholders - which is not sufficiently possible in the much closed and
less transparent procedures of the CJEU).
The application of the law that has the closest relationship with the
(source of the) acts of making available would allow exercising the right
of making available - and enforcing it against possible infringers - for
the entire activity and its impact (such as non-authorized downloading in,
and streaming to, another country). It is where violation of rights may be
prevented or eliminated with the greatest chance with all EU effect. The
law of the countries where the acts of unauthorized making available cause
damages may also be chosen, but in that case the court of any of those
countries may only rule on the issue of damages having emerged in the given
country.
The preliminary ruling of the CJEU in the Pinkney case (Case 170/12) has
interpreted Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation in the same way. The
Court found that the expression 'place where the harmful event occurred or
may occur' in Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation covers both the
place where the damage occurs (such as the damage caused by unauthorized
downloading) and the place of the event giving rise to it (in this case the
place of the act of making available to the public), so that a defendant
may be sued, at the option of the plaintiff, in the courts for either of
those places. However, it pointed out as follows:
  "[T]he answer to the questions referred is that Article 5(3) of the
  Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of alleged
  infringement of copyrights protected by the Member State of the court
  seised, the latter has jurisdiction to hear an action to establish
  liability brought by the author of a work against a company established
  in another Member State and which has, in the latter State, reproduced
  that work on a material support which is subsequently sold by companies
  established in a third Member State through an internet site also
  accessible with the jurisdiction of the court seised. That court has
  jurisdiction only to determine the damage caused in the Member State
  within which it is situated."


□ NO - Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[21])
□ NO OPINION

9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the "making available" right have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and  the
making available right. This may complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the  two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right  holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
YES - Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
X NO
We do not believe that EU legislation would be  necessary  to  achieve  the
"bundling of rights". The practice of European and other  CMOs  shows  that
any possible problem may be solved through joint  licenses  even  if  where
communication rights and  copy-related  rights  ("mechanical  rights")  are
managed by different CMOs (but, in fact, in many Member  States,  they  are
managed by the same CMOs).

3. Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the
Internet to another. They are indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are pending  before  the  CJEU[23]  in
which the question has been raised whether the  provision  of  a  clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter  protected   under
copyright on the screen and in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[24] as to whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception  for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other  subject
matter protected under copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES - Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,
or under specific circumstances, and why:

In general, the provision of a hyperlink makes a work  or  other  protected
material available to  the  public  to  access  it  at  a  time  and  place
individually chosen by them. Accordingly, it is an act of making  available
on demand to be subjected to the authorisation by  the  owners  of  rights.
Hyperlinks are essential tools for online content  delivery  and  thus  the
exploitation of works.

Despite the fact that making available on demand is subject to an exclusive
right, consumers should be able to participate in online  activities  which
involve providing hyperlinks in a manner that does not infringe  copyright.
Accordingly,  simple  systems  are   needed   whereby   consumers   receive
authorisation for doing this and the owners of rights receive  remuneration
for the use made of  their  works  in  this  manner.  There  are  licensing
mechanisms available to enable lawful  users'  access.  This  is  one  more
reason  for  which  there  is  no  justification  to  exempt  the  act   of
hyperlinking  to  a  work  or  other  protected  subject  matter  from  the
requirement of authorisation by the owners of rights. This view  was  held,
for example, by the District Court of The Hague when it ruled in  the  case
initiated by Buma/Stemra against the operator of radio  streaming  websites
Nederland.fm and Op.fm. The Court has found that the websites embedding  of
or  linking  to  radio-streams  without  licence  infringe  copyright  (see
decision No. 40 7402/HA ZA 11-2675 of December 19, 2012).

Not all linking should necessarily be made  subject  to  authorisation.  In
this respect, we refer to  the  "Executive  Summary"  of  the  "Report  and
opinion on the making available and communication  to  the  public  in  the
internet environment - focus on linking techniques on the Internet" adopted
by   the   Executive   Committee   of   ALAI   on   September   16,    2014
(www.alai.org/en/assets/files/resolutions/making-avialbale-right-report-
opinion.pdf):


     (i) The making available right covers links that enable members of  the
     public to access specific protected material; (ii) the making available
     right does not cover links that merely refer to a source from  which  a
     work may subsequently be accessed.

     It is irrelevant whether the link takes the user to specific content on
     a third-party website, or whether the  linking  site  retains  a  frame
     around the content, so that the user is not aware that she is accessing
     the content from a third-party website. It is also  irrelevant  to  the
     act of offering access whether the work made available through the link
     is itself infringing: it is the  act  of  offering  that  triggers  the
     making available right, and that act is the same whatever the copyright
     status of the work that is made available.

     There is obviously no infringement  of  the  "making  available"  right
     where the rightholder's decision whether and under which conditions the
     targeted content is made available on the  internet  is  respected.  In
     contrast, this means in particular that  linking  to  targeted  content
     infringes the "making available" right if (i) the content is  initially
     made available without the rightholder's  consent,  or  (ii)  technical
     protection measures have been circumvented or (iii) the availability of
     the content,  even  if  initially  disclosed  over  the  Internet  with
     consent, otherwise clashes with the declared or clearly implied will of
     the rightholder.

     Accordingly, courts should not introduce a general presumption  of  the
     rightholder's consent to further communication to the  public  of  what
     initially has been  posted  on  the  Internet  with  the  rightholder's
     consent, since  this  would  amount  to  introducing  an  exception  or
     limitation to the right, while general exceptions to the scope  of  the
     "making available" right require legislative action. This finding  does
     not exclude that a court may be  inclined  to  infer  such  consent  to
     permit the link based on the individual circumstances of a case.

The preliminary ruling of the CJEU in the  Swensson  case  (C-466/12)  still
needs  thorough  analysis.  It  seems,  however,  that  although  it  partly
corresponds to the findings of the ALAI opinion it also contradicts it.  The
ruling differs from the ALAI opinion in an important  aspect  and  it  seems
that, exactly due to that difference, it is in  conflict  with  EU  law  and
also with EU1s international obligations. In fact, the  Court  has  modified
the EU law, and since such legislative acts are not in its  competence,  the
validity of the preliminary ruling is questionable.

The important difference is the  introduction  by  the  Court  of  the  "new
public" requirement as a sine-qua-non criterion of the  application  of  the
right of on demand making available within the broader scope  of  the  right
of communication to the public provided in Article 8 of the WCT and  Article
3(1) of the Information Society Directive.

The "public" to which communication  is  made  means  always  all  potential
members of the public. The actual impact of a communication depends  on  how
many members of the public make use of the availability of  a  work  through
the  communication.  According  to  the  Court'  theory,  when  a  work   is
communicated and is thus currently  available,  it  cannot  be  communicated
again since the same broad public  is  targeted  irrespective  of  how  many
members of the public receive  actually  the  communication.  Therefore,  by
definition, there is no new public and thus the Court  believes  that  there
cannot be a new act of communication to the public.

This theory is in conflict with the international norms  and  the  EU  law.
There is no such kind of exhaustion of the right of  communication  to  the
public and there is no provision in the international treaties  and/or  the
Information Society Directive according to which the right of communication
to the public would not be applicable in  the  case  of  a  work  currently
communicated to the public through simultaneous acts of communication.

A simple reading of the provisions of the Berne Convention reveals it in  a
crystal-clear  manner  why  the  Court's  new  theory   contradicts   those
provisions. Under Article 1Ш5(1)(п) of the  Berne  Convention,  although  a
broadcast work is by definition  communicated  to  the  public,  it  is  an
exclusive  right  to  authorize  the   (simultaneous)   rebroadcasting   or
retransmission by cable of the works thus communicated to the public. It is
no condition that that the broadcast works are rebroadcast or retransmitted
by cable to a "new  public;"  the  only  condition  is  that  such  further
exploitation of broadcast works (= works communicated  to  the  public)  is
made by others  than  the  original  organizations.  Article  1Ш5(1)(ш)  on
simultaneous public communication of broadcast works (that is,  works  just
being communicated to the public) by loudspeakers,  etc.  similarly  rebuts
the Court's "new public" theory.

In the concrete case, the hyperlinks were  included  in  the  system  of  a
hyperlink-farm news aggregator to articles published on the  website  of  a
newspaper.  Since  on  the  newspaper's  website,  the  articles  were  not
protected by technological measures, they  were  freely  available  to  the
visitors of that website. As  a  result  of  the  hyperlinks  on  the  news
aggregator's website, the articles were made available in an  easier,  more
intensive manner and to a broader scope of  members  of  the  public  as  a
commercial  activity  of  the  website  (activity  which  would  have  been
meaningless without the availability of such articles). The journalists who
initiated the lawsuit demanded remuneration from the  news  aggregator  for
this kind of exploitation of their works going beyond what would have  just
followed from the making the works available to those members of the public
who visited the newspaper's website.

The CJEU erred when it based its ruling on  the  "new  public"  theory.  As
discussed above, such a theory does not stand a  serious  scrutiny  on  the
basis of the international and EU norms. The  principle  of  exhaustion  of
rights is  not  applicable  in  the  case  of  such  communication  rights.
Therefore, the  court  ruling,  according  to  which  the  exploitation  of
articles made available on a newspaper website by  offering  hyperlinks  to
them is free may only be  understood  as  an  exception  to  the  right  of
communication to the public (more precisely  to  the  right  of  on  demand
making  available  to  the  public  as  a  "sub-right"  of  the  right   of
communication to the public). However, even this kind  of  "spin-doctoring"
of the ruling does not make it acceptable from the viewpoint of EU law  for
two serious reasons. First, Article 5 of the Information Society  Directive
offers an exhaustive list of exceptions  to  the  rights  provided  in  the
Directive (including the broad right of communication to the  public  under
Article 3(2)) and an exception corresponding to the CJEU's ruling does  not
appear in the list. Secondly, and most importantly, the competence  of  the
CJEU does not extend to legislative acts of amending EU Directives.

The Court has characterized its ruling as an interpretation of the right of
communication to  the  public  which,  thus,  according  to  it,  would  be
obligatory for all Member States. If the Court' ruling were  valid,  Member
States would not be allowed even to provide compensation for such new forms
of  exploitation  of  works  by  hyperlink-farm  aggregators.   Under   the
international treaties and the EU law, through such linking, a new  act  of
communication to the public takes place and, thus, as discussed above,  the
ruling could only be understood as providing for an  exception.  The  Court
not only has entered the field of legislative activity,


which is not  in  its  competence,  but  by  declaring  the  new  exception
obligatory, it has also contradicted the spirit and letters of Article 5 of
the Information Directive which -  fortunately  and  rightly  -  (with  the
exception of what is provided in Article 5(1)) has made the application  of
the exceptions and limitations optional maintaining a relative  freedom  of
Member States.

The question is whether or not it would  be  justified  to  adopt  such  an
exception to the right of communication (online making  available)  to  the
public by those EU bodies  -  the  Parliament  and  the  Council  -  which,
contrary to the Court, truly have competence for legislative amendments. We
are of the view that this would not be justified. The  journalists  of  the
newspapers whose articles have been exploited by the  hyperlink  aggregator
by making them available in a much easier, more intensive manner and for  a
broader scope of members of the  public  had  fully  justified  legal  (and
moral) basis to demand remuneration for such extended use  of  their  works
(producing income for the news aggregator without any investment  into  the
creation and production of the relevant works and without any  proportional
compensation for the exploitation thereof).

□ NO OPINION

We have to give a fourth kind of response  because  we  cannot  respond  by
"Yes" or by "No" but we still do have opinion concerning these issues.  The
reason is that the question does not seem to be sufficiently clear  and  it
relates to two different things.
The question of temporary reproduction - not just necessarily on the screen
but in a computer memory as a result of which something may become visible
on the screen - have been regulated in Article 5(1) of the Information
Society Directive and under that provision it depends on a number of
criteria whether a "Yes" or "No" answer would be justified.
More or less the same may be said about copies in respect of the issue of
cash memory. This issue, at least from the viewpoint of service providers,
has been regulated in Article 12 of the Electronic Commerce Directive which
provides various criteria on which a "Yes" or "No" response might be given.


4. Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g.
download to own). Questions arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)[25].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the
case of an act of transmission equivalent in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)[26].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a  copy  of  a  work
after they have "re-sold" it - this is often referred to  as  the  "forward
and delete" question) as well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

would be the consequences of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
We do agree with the analysis of the Questionnaire in that the principle of
EU  exhaustion  of  the  distribution  right  only  applies  in   case   of
distribution of physical copies (when a tangible article such as a CD or  a
book,  etc.  is  sold,  the  right  holder  cannot  prevent   the   further
distribution of that tangible article). This follows unequivocally from the
Information Society Directive, in particular from its Recital (29):
    "The question of exhaustion does not arise in the case of services  and
    on-line services in particular. This also  applies  with  regard  to  a
    material copy of a work or other subject- matter made by a user of such
    a service with the consent of  the  rightholder.  Therefore,  the  same
    applies to rental and lending of the original and copies  of  works  or
    other subject-matter which are services by nature. Unlike CD-ROM or CD-
    I, where the
    intellectual property is incorporated in a material medium,  namely  an
    item of goods, every on-line service is in _ fact an act  which  should
    be subject to authorisation where the coyyrisht  or  related  right  so
    provides." (Emphasis added.)
One  of  the  main  objectives  of  the   Information   Society   was   the
implementation of the WCT and the WPPT. The limitation of the exhaustion of
rights to the sale or other transfer of ownership of tangible copies was  -
and still is - indispensable in order to be in accordance with the  minimum
obligations under the Treaties. Article 6(2) of the WCT and  Articles  8(2)
and 12(2) of the WPPT only allow exhaustion of the right of distribution as
provided in Article 6(1) of the WCT and Articles 8(1) and 12(1) of the WPPT
as interpreted by the agreed statements concerning those articles.
The agreed statements limit the application of the  right  of  distribution
"exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation  as  tangible
copies." It is possible - under the "umbrella solution" -  to  characterize
making available to the public of works and other protected  materials  for
downloading intangible digital copies as "distribution" of copies. This is,
however, still an act covered by the obligation to grant an exclusive right
of (interactive) making available to the public, and it  also  implies  (by
downloading of digital intangible copies in electronic memories) the  right
of reproduction. The two Treaties do not allow exhaustion of these  rights,
and the limitation of these right by exhaustion  cannot  be  introduced  by
changing the legal characterization of the acts which, under the  Treaties,
are  covered  by  the  non-exhaustible  rights  of  making  available   and
reproduction  (see  the   "principle   of   relative   freedom   of   legal
characterization of acts and rights" in the WIPO Glossary on the  Copyright
and Related Rights Terms", WIPO publication No 891 (E), 2003, p.).
"Online exhaustion", as mentioned above  in  the  Questionnaire,  would  be
supposed to take place in a way  that  the  original  copy  "resold"  would
disappear from the electronic memory of the "seller" and only the  copy  of
the new  owner  would  remain  in  the  latter's  electronic  memory.  This
inevitably leads to the creation of a new copy in the electronic memory  of
the "buyer"- and also an intermediary copy (not covered by Article 5(1)  of
the Information Society Directive) in the system of the "online second-hand
shop." The making of such copies is  covered  by  the  exclusive  right  of
reproduction; a right in the case of which the international norms and  the
EU directives do not allow the application of the principle  of  exhaustion
of rights.
The Questionnaire -  rightly  enough  -  refers  to  "difficult  questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach  (how  to
avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after  they  have  're-
sold' it." This would be a  decisive  problem  even  if  the  principle  of
exhaustion  of  rights  were  applicable  (but  it  is   not)   under   the
international treaties and  the  acquis  in  the  cases  described  in  the
Questionnaire. There would be no real guarantee that an original owner of a
copy would not make a "back-up" copy in an external storage device  before,
or in parallel with, the transmission for the creation of a new copy.  This
fundamental problem could hardly be shrugged off with cynical  remarks  (i)
that, since this would not be allowed under the copyright law, if  somebody
(or even everybody) still made another copy in this  way  it  would  be  an
infringement of copyright; (ii) that, since under the concept of an  online
resale system this, in principle, would be  prohibited,  if  the  customers
still committed such infringements, it would be alien to the concept of the
system; and (iii) that, therefore, the owners of rights simply might do the
same as in case of any other infringements; they might try to make  use  of
the available enforcement measures.
It may occur to someone that the making of new copies on the basis  of  (in
principle, instead of, but due to the  unresolvable  "difficult  questions"
mentioned above, practically in  addition  to)  an  existing  copy  through
online transmission might be a special case in which an
exception to the right of reproduction  might  be  applied.  In  fact,  the
ReDigi company had tried to make use of this idea in a dispute ruled on  by
the District Court of the Southern District of New York (decision  No.  12-
009/2012 of March 30, 2013). ReDigi claimed that the online "transfer"  (in
fact, copying) of used sound recordings through its system would be allowed
not only on the basis of the first sale doctrine (a claim rejected  by  the
Court for the obvious reason that there is no exhaustion in respect of  the
right of reproduction) but also under the  fair  use  doctrine.  The  Court
considered the four factors to be taken  into  account  for  any  fair  use
defense as codified in section 107 of the US  Copyright  Court,  and  found
that the given use did not correspond to any of those factors.
The Court has pointed out that allowing  free  subsequent  copying  by  the
costumers of these kinds of "online secondary markets" would undermine  the
chance for normal exploitation of the works and other  protected  materials
concerned. Thus, any possible free  use  for  such  purposes  would  be  in
conflict  also  with  the  three-step  test  under  Article  5(5)  of   the
Information Society Directives (and under the relevant  provisions  of  the
international treaties).
The Court has described in a persuasive  manner  the  decisive  differences
between  traditional  secondary  markets  of  tangible  used   copies   and
subsequent online copying of intangible copies. The fact mentioned  by  the
Questionnaire above - namely that perfect qualities  of  intangible  copies
never deteriorate irrespective of the number of  subsequent  recopying  (in
contrast with what takes place  in  the  second-hand  market  for  physical
goods) - is only one of the reasons for which allowing such activity  would
create conflicts with a normal exploitation of works and would unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interest of the owners of rights.
The other - and much  weightier  -  reason  for  which  such  conflict  and
prejudice would emerge  is  the  combination  of  the  perfect  quality  of
subsequent copies with the extremely increased ease and  speed  with  which
the "used" copies could be transferred to others. This kind of transfer  of
copies would take  place  after  full  consumptive  use  (reading  a  book,
watching a movie, etc.) and would create unfair competition for the  owners
of rights. The owners of right are constrained to  apply  prices  that  may
guarantee recouping their creative and financial investments with a  modest
profit margin necessary for sustainable creation and production. The second-
hand "online shops" could offer the same perfect copies at a much  lower  -
and foreseeably, due to the subsequent "resales", ever lower - prices.
This would not be like reading a book, then deciding  to  resell  it  to  a
second-hand bookshop, with the result that the book then might spend  there
a shorter or longer time before somebody else may by it. In the case of  an
on-line "second-hand bookshop", as soon as an original buyer of  an  e-book
has read the last sentence of a  thriller,  within  a  couple  of  minutes,
somebody else could begin reading it at a lower price (and then a third,  a
tenth, a hundredth one). This could take place within a fraction of time in
comparison with the slow speed of changing ownership in traditional second-
hand markets which has been taken as a model for the doctrine of exhaustion
of rights. Its impact for the economic rights of the owners of rights would
be like a practice where the viewers of a new  film  would  be  allowed  to
resell their entry tickets when they come out from the cinema;  the  buyers
of the cheaper "resold" tickets would not be obligated to buy tickets  from
the cinema operator, and at the end of the projection  of  the  film,  they
could also sell the second-hand tickets possibly at an even lower price  to
the viewers of still another presentation of the film.
The Questionnaire also refers  to  possible  differing  impact  of  "online
exhaustion" depending on the "types of content." It is true that  the  ways
of use of different categories of works and other protected materials -  in
particular from the viewpoint of  the  way  of  their  "consumption"  -  do
differ. The impact would not be the same in the case of a computer  program
as in the

case of a movie or an e-book. Nevertheless,  the  same  provisions  of  the
international treaties and the Information Society Directive apply  to  all
categories. Fortunately, the UsedSoft ruling of the CJEU is  restricted  to
computers programs (and thus it is not  applicable  for  other  categories,
including data bases  and  video  games  which  are  operated  by  computer
programs but they are much more and different than just programs).  As  the
Questionnaire stresses, the UsedSoft ruling is based  on  certain  findings
that, in respect of the issues of online exhaustion, the Computer  Programs
Directive includes lex specialis rules  in  comparison  with  the  relevant
provisions of the Information Society Directive. It  seems,  however,  that
there may be well- founded doubts as to whether the alleged  lex  specialis
elements truly exist. For the reasons of these doubts  and  concerning  the
issues discussed above, we refer to Mihály Ficsor's study  "Current  issues
of exhaustion of rights (Kirtsaeng & Quality  King,  ReDigi  v.  UsedSoft)"
published on the website www.copyrightseesaw.net.

C. Registration of works and other subject matter - is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights. However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[27]. Moreover a system of registration does not need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and  with   the   increased
opportunities that digital technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration
are increasingly being considered[28].

15. Would the creation of a registration system at  EU  level  help  in  the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
□ YES X NO
According to the question, registration would facilitate licensing. In our
view, the voluntary registration of works and other protected materials,
authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, licensing conditions within the
collective management system combined with the rights management
information developed and managed by CMOs is the best and most workable
framework for facilitating licensing. In certain specific aspects for
certain specific purposes, some kind of EU-level registration may be
justified (like registration of orphan works), but there is no visible
justification to transform the well-functioning voluntary registration
systems of CMOs. Removing registration from CMO systems might also create
the danger that registration could turn - even if not into a de iure but in
certain elements and impacts - into de facto formality.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held  by
producers, collective management organisations, and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,  internationally   agreed   'identifiers'.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[29], and identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and  databases.
The Global Repertoire Database[30]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of musical  works
worldwide. The Linked Content  Coalition[31]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) - a comprehensive data model for all types of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[32] is seeking to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption  of
identifiers in the content sector, and in  promoting  the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Our basic response is that this is typically a matter to be  left  to  CMOs
representing different categories of owners of rights  and  their  European
and international organizations.

It is to be noted that EC-sponsored projects such as ARROW  and  ARROW-Plus
include references to the desirability of  using  international  identifier
standards such as ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier, ISO  27729)
and ISTC (International Standard text  Code,  ISO  21047).  This  could  be
facilitated by the transposition of ISO 21047 and ISO 27729  into  European
standards.


E. Term of protection - is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with  the
applicable national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[33]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in  the
digital environment?
X YES - Please explain
In general, there is no reason for which the terms of protection  of  works
and other protected materials under the acquis communautaire would have  to
be changed.
In our view, it is not truly the case that producers of  audiovisual  works
do not benefit from the 70 year term  of  protection.  Since  the  economic
rights are consolidated in different ways in the  hand  of  the  producers,
they do benefit from the longer term  of  protection  even  if  the  rights
transferred to them are granted originally for audiovisual authors.  It  is
only the special "related right" established in the acquis where no  longer
protection applies (in fact, it would be difficult speak about  a  term  of
protection longer than what is prescribed by international treaties,  since
there is no international  treaty  on  this  specific  EU-created  "related
right").
We refer, however, to the obligation of the European Commission  prescribed
in Article 3(2) of the Terms Extension Directive to  assess  the  need  for
extending the Directive  to  audiovisual  performances.  We  consider  such
extension  justified  and  we  believe  that  the   principle   of   double
assimilation of the status of audiovisual performers (partly to the  status
of performers whose performances are fixed on phonograms and partly to  the
status of audiovisual authors) served as a basis for the Beijing Treaty  on
Audiovisual Performers further confirmed that such an extension take place.
NO - Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

□ NO OPINION

   I. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable  the  use
of  works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class).  At  EU  level  they  are
established in a number of copyright  directives,  most  notably  Directive
2001/29/EC[34].
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[35].   In   accordance   with   international
obligations, the EU acquis requires that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised  at
EU level)[36], these limitations and exceptions are often optional[37],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting  that
not all of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[38].
The cross-border effect of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders. In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are  used
for illustration in an online course given by an  university  in  a  Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of  that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member  States'  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain  uses   the
authorisation of rightholders is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member States regulatory

framework while ensuring the required legal certainty,  including  for  the
functioning of the Single Market, and  respecting  the  EU's  international
obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?
□ YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases

X NO - Please explain
There are no problems arising from the optional nature of  limitations  and
exceptions. It would not be justified to make them mandatory and, thus,  to
remove the Member States' flexibility to adopt certain  variations  of  the
relevant norms to their social and cultural  policies.  The  principles  of
subsidiarity  and  proportionality  require  that  the  present  level   of
harmonization be maintained.
□ NO OPINION

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
□ YES - Please explain by referring to specific cases

X NO - Please explain
No, not at all. See our response to Question 21. □ NO OPINION

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed  from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
There is no need to extend the current list of exceptions and  limitations.
They are satisfactory both for the "traditional"  and  online  environment.
The EU bodies and the Members States should  reject  the  demands  for  new
exceptions and limitations behind which, covered by certain  slogans  about
"public interests" and the private interests of consumers,  there  are,  in
fact, hard private interests of those  who  would  like  to  establish  and
operate profit-making services without remunerating the  owners  of  rights
for the use of their works and other protected materials.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  offlexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework   for
limitations and exceptions?
□ YES - Please explain why


X NO - Please explain why

See our responses to Questions 21 to 23.

□ NO OPINION

25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]
We do not agree with the basic thrust of this question. There  is  no  need
for further flexibility beyond  what  is  rightly  offered  to  the  Member
States. The fair dealing system applied in a  couple  of  Member  States  -
supported by old traditions and well-developed case law - seems  to  be  in
accordance with the current acquis.

We strongly reject the idea of extending the US fair use system  to  Europe
or even considering it as a possible option. It is  well  known  that  this
idea is promoted by certain  "copyright  minimalist"  ideologues  and  NGOs
behind which it would be difficult not  to  see  some  big  and  prosperous
online intermediaries who believe (wrongly even from the viewpoint of their
own genuine long-term interests) that they benefit from an as low level  of
copyright protection as possible. In Europe, the introduction of a fair use
system, in the absence of underlining traditions and of a  rich  case  law,
dangerous legal uncertainty  would  emerge.  It  would  be  detrimental  to
European cultural creativity and productivity  in  the  current  atmosphere
when many politicians tend to  give  in  to  populists  slogans  and  "mass
movements" (among the generators, financers  and  aggressive  promoters  of
which again we can see certain profithungry actors of the IT industries).

26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?
□ YES - Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to

X NO - Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
It would be difficult to explain why territoriality constitutes  a  problem
since there is no such problem.
□ NO OPINION

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the  question  of  "fair
compensation"  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part  of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

[Open question]

See our responses to the previous Questions.

A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of  publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of  preservation  and
archiving[39] and enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the collections  of  such  institutions[40].  The  public
lending (under an exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental
and Lending Directive[41].

Questions arise as to whether the current framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this  may   cause   to
rightholders. The role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records,  or  films)  -
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national  laws
allowing for the making of such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.
28. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception  to  preserve
and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?
□ YES - Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.
In our Association, there are representatives of all kinds of stakeholders,
but we cannot experience such problems.

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
See our negative response to Question 28 1. Off-premises access to library
collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the  consultation  of  works
and other subject- matter (consulting an e-book,  watching  a  documentary)
via dedicated terminals on the premises  of  such  establishments  for  the
purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and
other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user  is  not  on  the
premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally  addressed
in agreements between universities/libraries  and  publishers.  Some  argue
that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.
32. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,  including  across
borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for  purposes  of  research
and private study?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research  and  private
study?

2. E - lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and  libraries   are
currently experimenting with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
problems when trying to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other  materials
held in your collection?
b) [In particular if you are an end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books  or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending), including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?
c)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference  do  you  see
between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises  consultation

distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?


[Open question]

See our negative response to Question 36.

3. Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum  of
Understanding (MoU) on  key  principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in
the normal channels of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors  and
publishers on the other[42].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such  licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or  the  recognition  of  an  "extended  effect"  to  the  licences
granted)[43].

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have  a  crossborder
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
□ YES - Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

X NO - Please explain
Although such agreements may be useful, we cannot see any reason for which
legislation described in the question would be necessary and justified.

□ NO OPINION
41. Would it be necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters' archives)?
□ YES - Please explain

X NO - Please explain
For the time being, we can see no reason for developing such mechanisms. □
NO OPINION

B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC[44]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation  at
Member States level. The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some
argue that the law should provide for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including  across
borders?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
□ YES - Please explain

X NO
We have to give the same negative response as to Questions 28, 32 and 36.
□ NO OPINION

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]


In our country, such "mechanism" is used satisfactorily, in general without
major infringement of copyright, in the system of book publishing for
educational purposes
45. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

No, this is definitely not our view.

46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
See our negative responses to the previous Questions.

C. Research
Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether  to
implement in their national laws a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works  or
other subject  matter  in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?
□ YES - Please explain

49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
General  and  specialized  libraries,  including   those   functioning   in
educational establishments and  archives  do  function  in  a  satisfactory
manner in accordance with the international, E-level and national copyright
norms.

D. Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC[46]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a  disability.  The  open  formulation  of  this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works  published  in
special formats and facilitating their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [47]

The Marrakesh Treaty[48] has been adopted to facilitate access to published
works for persons who are blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows
organisations for the blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired  persons   without   the
authorisation of the rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50. (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including across  borders,  arising
from Member States' implementation of this exception?
b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for  persons
with    disabilities:]    Have    you     experienced     problems     when
distributing/communicating works published in special  formats  across  the
EU?
c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced  specific
problems resulting  from  the  application  of  limitations  or  exceptions
allowing for the distribution/communication of works published  in  special
formats, including across borders?
□ YES - Please explain by giving examples

X NO

times) offers adequate framework in accordance with Article 5(3)(b) of  the
Information Society Directive.

E. Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[49] are different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to  e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made
of the relevant texts and data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain  "access"  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific  content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe"[50]. In  the  context  of
these discussions,


other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to
mine material to which access has  been  provided  through  a  subscription
agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining
should be introduced, possibly  on  the  basis  of  a  distinction  between
commercial and non-commercial.

F. User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making  of
so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original
content, they can also take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[51]. User-generated content (UGC) can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is no longer  the  preserve  of  a  technically  and
artistically adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of  expression
and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and  the
users generating the content. In any event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users  were
pledged by rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
"Licences for Europe" discussions[52].

Similarly to our negative responses to Questions 28, 32, 36, 42, 47, 50 and
53, we have to give a negative response to this Question  too.  As  regards
how derivative works based on preexisting works may be used (to which these
questions seem to relate), see our responses to Questions 59 and 60 below.
□ NO OPINION

Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)  is  properly  identified  for

(b) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?
□ YES - Please explain

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION
We have to give a fourth kind of response. Simply we do not  understand  to
which cases and to what kinds of derivative works these  questions  relate.
We do  not  understand  either  for  what  reasons  the  questions  do  not
differentiate  depending  on  whether  or  not  the  adaptations  or  other
alterations of the pre-existing works have been authorized by  the  authors
in accordance with the right of adaptation under Article 12  of  the  Berne
Convention or by law in the form of an exception (in particular for  parody
in accordance with Article 5(3)(k) of the Information  Society  Directive).
It is important to note this since, in case  of  derivative  works  created
without authorization of the authors or by  the  law,  we  are  faced  with
infringements and, in view of the basic legal  principle  of  nemo  auditur
suam turpitudinem allegans, it is hardly justified  to  consider  copyright
claims as well founded that are based on such infringing acts.
60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):]
Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use  of
the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?
□ YES - Please explain

X NO - Please explain
While we give a definite negative response to these questions, we  have  to
add that we do not believe that such questions may emerge specifically  for
user-generated works.


This is so because basically two possible cases may be involved.
First, if  a  lawful  derivative  work  is  involved,  since  it  has  been
authorized by the authors on the basis of their exclusive right provided in
Article 12 of the Berne Convention or by the law, for example as a  parody,
its status is exactly the same as the status of any  work  protected  under
the international treaties. Since  this  is  the  case,  if  there  is  any
question concerning due remuneration of authors for online  uses  of  their
works, the question is necessarily the  same  from  the  viewpoint  of  the
authors of all categories of works irrespective of whether  they  are  pre-
existing works or derivative works.
Second, if -  in  contrast  -  someone  makes  a  derivative  work  without
authorization by the authors or by the  law,  due  to  the  above-mentioned
legal principle of  nemo  auditur  suam  turpitudinem  allegans,  the  very
question of how the infringer may hardly be justified. If the work is  used
either in its pre-exiting form or in a form adapted or otherwise altered by
such infringers, the remuneration is due to  the  author  of  the  original
work. (It may be an issue  to  discuss  how  the  principle  of  "theft  is
prohibited even from a thief might be applied in such a case, and  how  the
maker of an infringing derivative version might  oppose  the  use  thereof.
However, it does  not  change  the  legal  situation  that,  if  such  non-
authorized altered versions of pre-existing works are used, the authors  of
those works are in the position to exercise  their  rights,  including  the
right to receive remuneration.
In fact, in many cases,  in  addition  to  special  licensing  systems  and
tariffs for "small users" (the existence of which has been recognized as  a
result of the "Licensing Europe" consultations), it may be a  solution  for
the authors of pre-existing works not to pay attention necessarily  to  the
question of whether unauthorized non-commercial "UGC" versions truly amount
to derivative works or not, but just to exercise and enforce  their  rights
in respect of such versions too on the basis of their rights  in  the  pre-
existing works.
□ NO OPINION

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
For the reasons for which there is no problem - other than, of course,  the
implied encouraging of making and use of infringing derivative  works  that
might hide behind such questions - see our responses to Questions 58 to 60.

its main elements? Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?

[Open question]

See our response to Question 61. The licensing systems applied by CMOs  for
small noncommercial users recognized as appropriate in the framework of the
"Licensing Europe" consultation facilitate lawful  UGC  uses  where  it  is
justified.


   II. Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[53]. Levies are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a  view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making
copies for their private use) or through use  of  certain  technique  (i.e.
reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the  question  arises
as to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies
to certain types of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope  and
application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[54]  in  the
digital environment?
□ YES - Please explain

X NO - Please explain
If 'the need to clarify' means a revision of Article 5(2)(a) and (b) of the
Information Society Directive, we do not see any need and justification for
such a "clarification".
It goes without saying  that  the  private  copying  limitation  (it  is  a
limitation of the exclusive right to a right to remuneration in  accordance
with, and controlled by, the three-step test  under  Article  5(5)  of  the
Directive) as provided in Article 5(2)(b) equally applies  in  the  digital
environment.
The rulings of  the  CJEU  on  the  application  of  this  limitation  have
contributed to the clarification of the  various  issues  that  have  truly
emerged.
It follows from the three-step test that it is an obligation of Contracting
Parties  to  the  international  copyright   treaties   to   diminish   the
unreasonable  prejudice  created  by  widespread  private  copying  to  the
legitimate interests of authors and other the owners of rights at least  to
a reasonable level.
The existing private copying systems - which do  function  adequately  when
they are applied in accordance with the  international  treaty  obligations
and the provision of Article 5(2)(b) of the Directive  -  have  become  the
target of unjustified and badly founded attacks: (i) by the  big  and  rich
entertainment equipment and recording material manufactures  which  do  not
accept even such a marginal  contribution  to  remunerating  the  creators,
producers and publishers of works and other materials without  which  their
equipment and recording materials would totally or  at  least  to  a  great
extent meaningless and which use their enormous economic power and lobbying
capacity against the fully justified system foreseen in the Directive; (ii)
by  neoanarchist  groups  which  attack  practically  everything  that   is
indispensable for adequate protection of the rights of  authors  and  other
owners of rights; (iii) by the governments of certain Member  States  which
simply have not implemented Article 5(2)(b) and  now  they  would  like  to
adapt the EU copyright system in a way that  they  may  find  "retroactive"
justification for violating their obligations under the acquis.
Along with all the authors, performers and other owners  of  copyright  and
related rights of the EU, we are  of  the  view  that  a  kind  of  radical
overhaul of the private copying  provisions,  such  as  what  has  occurred
unfortunately in Spain, or what might follow from the adoption  of  certain
recommendations in the not duly informed and badly founded Vitorino  report
would be not only  in  conflict  with  the  acquis  communautaire  and  the
international obligations binding the EU and  its  Member  States,  but  it
would also undermine the potentials of cultural creativity  and  production
of the Union (which is still  an  existing  comparative  advantage  in  the
global  markets  and  which  is  and  indispensable  element  of   European
identity).

□ NO OPINION

65. Should digital copies made by end users for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where  the
harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private  copying
levies?[55]
X YES - Please explain
The question includes an implied allegation with which  we  do  not  agree.
Digital copies made following initial downloads cannot be exempted from the
private  copying  remuneration  systems.  In  view  of   current   consumer
practices, one cannot reasonably consider such acts of private  copying  as
causing "minimal harm".
It should be noted that that the approach proposed in the  Vitorino  report
in this respect is also in conflict with the ruling adopted by the CJEU  in
the VG Wort case (C-457/11).
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders'
revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We do not fully understand the  question.  However,  if  it  suggests  that
Article 5(2)(b) might not  be  equally  applicable  with  respect  to  such
services, we, of course, do not agree with this kind of suggestion.

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?[56]
X YES - Please explain
This would certainly create a better understanding among consumers provided
it went along with creating or strengthening public awareness that what  is
involved is not a  tax  but  an  indispensable  remuneration  to  guarantee
sustainable cultural creativity  and  productivity  (otherwise,  from  this
viewpoint, even the now "traditional" use of the expression "levy"  is  not
fortunate).
We have to add, however, that for the purpose of creating awareness in this
way, there is no need to review Article 5(2)(b) of the Information  Society
Directive.

□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that  context,  not
all Member States have ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of  undue
payments[57].

68. Have you experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?
X YES - Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.


This phenomenon does exist. However, due to the shortage of available time,

precise statistics.
□ NO - Please explain

□ NO OPINION

69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to  persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?  Do
any of those transactions result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in

stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
For the reasons mentioned in our response to Question 68, we  cannot  offer
detailed information in this respect.

70. Where such undue payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?
[Open question]

For the reasons mentioned in our response to Question 68, we  cannot  offer
detailed information in this respect.

71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
Our basic response is that what is the most important is to  apply  Article
5(2)(b)  adequately  in  accordance  with  the  international   norms,   in
particular the provisions  on  the  three-step  test.  This  would  require
persuading the Member States that have not done so yet - there is  a  well-
known mechanism of the EU for a case where a Member State  fails  apply  EU
norms - to duly implement the right to remuneration  for  private  copying.
Such measures as those  taken  in  Spain  recently  get  quite  clearly  in
conflict with the Article 5(2)(b) and the relevant international norms. The
same would be the result of  several  badly  informed  and  poorly  founded
recommendations of the Vitorino report.

  III. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors  or
performers to producers[58] or determining who the owner of the  rights  is
when the


work or other subject matter is created in the  context  of  an  employment
contract[59]. This is an area that has been traditionally left  for  Member
States to regulate and there  are  significant  differences  in  regulatory
approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of
the creative industries.
Concerns continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
We do agree that authors and performers are in general  badly  remunerated.
However, we are of the view that, for the time being, no  further  EU-level
legislation is needed. Due to the broadly  differing  economic  and  social
conditions of the Member States, this should rather  be  left  to  national
legislation, if any, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity  and
proportionality.
Apart from this, the best mechanism to  ensure  adequate  exercise  of  the
rights of authors and performers and obtain due remuneration is  collective
management. Our impression is that this fact  is  not  duly  recognized  by
certain EU bodies and national governments.

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?
□ YES

X NO - Please explain why
Real problems are involved; however, for the  time  being,  the  settlement
thereof should be left to the Member States
□ NO OPINION

74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]

In accordance with our response to Question 72, we are of the view that new
legal-political approach would be needed to collective  management  of  the
rights of authors and performers. Recently  too  much  and  too  unilateral
attention has  been  devoted  to  certain  abstract  issues,  such  as  the
application of general competition rules, without recognizing the  specific
requirements  of  collective  management.  It  has  been   neglected   that
collective management is an indispensable means of exercising the rights of
creators, contributing to economic,  social  and  cultural  development  of
Member States with different conditions and requirements and, in

accordance with this, protecting cultural diversity - which is one  of  the
most precious assets of Europe.

  IV. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE[60] provides for a harmonised framework for the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright  and
related rights. The Commission has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[61].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in
case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen
respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for  a  commercial
purpose[62]. One means  to  do  this  could  be  to  clarify  the  role  of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[63]. At the same time, there  could
be clarification of the safeguards for respect of  private  life  and  data
protection for private users.

75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

X YES - Please explain

We give a strong affirmative response to this question. This seems  is  one
of the most important current tasks in the field of copyright -  which  has
been badly neglected recently in the EU copyright policy and projects.

It should be stressed that due civil enforcement is necessary not  only  in
the case infringements  committed  for  commercial  purposes  but  for  any
infringements. (Otherwise, it would be desirable to replace the concept  of
infringements committed  with  a  commercial  purpose  by  the  concept  of
infringements on  a  commercial  scale.)  The  application  of  enforcement
measures should take place in accordance with the  recognition  that,  from
the viewpoint of owners of rights,  it  is  completely  irrelevant  whether
someone undermines their chance for normal exploitation of their rights  or
creates serious prejudice to their legitimate interests with or  without  a
commercial purpose. The impact of the  infringement  is  exactly  the  same
irrespective of whether the  infringer  would  like  to  obtain  commercial
income or he or she just happens to disagree with the copyright system and,
under some  neo-anarchist  slogan  of  free  access  to  everything,  makes
available protected works  and  other  materials  to  the  entire  internet
population without authorization. The conflict with normal exploitation and
the prejudice will be exactly the same; and the application of  enforcement
measures should be in accordance with this important fact.

□ NO OPINION

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as   Internet   service
providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.) in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Currently this is truly the most important aspect  of  re-establishing  the
badly  disrupted  balance  of  interests  to  the  detriment  of   authors,
performers and other owners of copyright and related rights. The provisions
of the Electronic Commerce Directive are not suitable anymore to  guarantee
due cooperation of internet  intermediaries  with  the  owners  of  rights.
Adequate regulation and application of notice-and-take-down systems,  as  a
minimum obligation, should be prescribed. In Hungary,  such  a  system  has
been set up specifically for copyright and related rights infringements  as
part of the Electronic Commerce Act (Act CVIII of  2001)  implementing  the
Electronic Commerce Directive, and it functions appropriately.
It should also  be  taken  into  account,  however,  that  this  is  not  a
sufficient measure against  widespread  infringements  and,  in  particular
against the phenomenon of immediate  re-  uploading  of  infringing  copies
"taken down." It cannot be  disregarded  anymore  that  adequate  filtering
technologies are available - as a matter of technological  process  without
any danger of conflicting with privacy considerations  -  that  allow  duly
targeted, and not general, monitoring and  blocking  of  infringing  copies
taken down but  re-uploaded.  On  the  basis  of  such  targeted  filtering
systems, in order to re-establish a reasonable level of  online  protection
of owners of rights, it is justified to transform the mere notice-and-take-
down systems to well- balanced notice-and-take-down-and-stay-down systems.
Even this is not sufficient,  however,  against  rogue  websites,  such  as
Pirate Bay, which are set up  and  operated  with  complete  disrespect  of
copyright and related rights. Against  such  websites,  the  obligation  of
access  providers  prescribed  on  the  basis  of  due  procedures  is   an
indispensable measure.
It is obvious  that  the  application  of  such  indispensable  enforcement
measures may be only one element of  a  complex  strategy  to  address  the
problems of massive unauthorized and unremunerated online use of works  and
other protected materials. Lawful sources, inventive  licensing  techniques
on the basis of  exclusive  rights,  and  remuneration  systems  (including
systems where online intermediaries are obligated to pay remuneration  from
their income obtained from advertisers) are equally necessary.

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and
other rights such as the protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?
□ YES - Please explain


X NO - Please explain
The balance has been disrupted to the detriment of owners of rights on  the
basis of not duly substantiated  slogan-type  allegations  about  potential
violations of private life and the protection  of  personal  data.  Due  to
technological developments, now adequate automatic  systems  are  available
which may be applied - with due  cooperation  by  online  intermediaries  -
simply with the result of preventing and eliminating serious  infringements
without any impact whatsoever on "private life" and without  any  the  need
for revealing personal data to the owners of rights.
□ NO OPINION

     V. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
□ YES X NO
No; not at all. The need and the justification for such a  copyright  title
(on the basis of a "European Copyright Code") do not exist at  all  (except
for a certain group of academics with whom other academics - rightly enough
- do not agree). It is useless even  to  deal  with  the  very  idea  which
belongs to the world of dreams (nightmare kinds of dreams). There are  many
serious copyright issues that truly exist; they should be addressed.

□ NO OPINION

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?
[Open question]

For the time being, we do not believe that this should be considered either
as a next step (not at all) or a longer term  project  in  the  foreseeable
future.

  VI. Other issues


The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the
most important matters relating to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright. Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
for copyright? Please explain and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
addressed.
[Open question]
There is a fundamentally important matter. The system of adequate
protection and enforcement of copyright has been eroded recently as a
result of successful lobbying of certain special interests groups (ever
more powerful IT industries, online intermediaries, entertainment equipment
and material manufactures, etc.) and by neo-anarchist movements supported
and aggressively promoted by them. There is a need for a serious
reconsideration of the EU's copyright policy in close connection with its
cultural policy, with the objective of reestablishing an adequate balance
of interests seriously disrupted to the detriment of creators and producers
of cultural goods and services. This Questionnaire seems to be better
balanced than certain previous documents issued by the Commission but it
still reflects a trend to prefer considerations trying to justify weakening
of copyright protection. We believe that this approach should be changed;
it is not only a cultural interest of the EU, but also its weighty economic
and social interest.

online uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[17]  Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of
so-called "neighbouring rights" in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast. Authors'  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a "work" or "works", while content protected by neighbouring
rights is referred to as "other subject matter".
[18]  The right to "authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means a nd in any form, in whole or in  part"
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)  although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[19]  The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available to
the public "on demand" (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[20] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L'Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[21]  The objective of implementing a "country of  origin"  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[22]  Injunctive relief is a temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

[26]  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a secondhand  licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder's
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on  the  Computer  Programs  Directive.  It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[27]  For example,  it  does  not  affect  "domestic"  works  -  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[28]  On the basis of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
