            I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider

context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

             I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere
in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.
10 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
        trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
        which you live?

  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
 of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
 visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
 applications and other software)

 While outside the UK, in which I normally live, I cannot view state-sponsored content
 produced by the BBC via their website. Further, it cannot be replicated on other sites. In
 addition, while outside of France, I can't access some academic publications - particularly
 theses - at state universities that are important to my research, because copyright forces
 them to be made available only in France, despite being digital documents and often
 presented at an open, public hearing. Conversely, while in Denmark, although I do not use a
 television, I am forced to pay at 40 EUR/month for access to copyrighted state television
 material in a language I don't understand - because I have data access on my mobile phone.
 The reasoning is that because you could potentially watch television online, you must pay
 for it. This "guilt until proven innocent" mentality extends to internet access provision: if
 you have cable, you must pay an extra 15 EUR a month for access to copyrighted television
 programs, even if you have no television. This gouging practice is the rule rather than the
 exception. Both these charges, amounting to 55 EUR / month, are fixed and paid by all
 citizens with cable internet, purely to fund copyrighted material, with no waivers available.

     2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
        seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

 YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to
copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing
services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)?
Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
applications and other software).

Pictures I contribute to encyclopedias while travelling cannot always be accepted, despite
being of high documentary quality, because it is not possible to show them in seemingly
arbitrary regions (following 2001/29/EC).

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
      How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
      possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
      Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

[Open question]

Because of the complexity of granting such licences when e.g. sharing research data, we
often just give up, or find an informal arrangement. This directly and significantly damages
the dissemination of scientific results and presentation material (such as academic videos)
within and without the EU. In turn, our research impact is reduced and we become less
competitive.




   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
      what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

There are significant problems: one is often forced to fund copyrighted material, and there is
no balance in fair use or private consumption. This damages innovation in both science and
also broadcasting; diversity is reduced and existing, old-style, slow-to-adapt organisations
maintain a strong lobby. This damages both the state and the individual. Copyright change
is needed to adapt to the digital world we live in. It is a travesty that 25 years after the
advent of the web, the offline market enjoys better provision, fairness and regulation than
the online. Legislation must be harmonised to create a single digital market, granting our
citizens equal access and choice over content and services. Achieving this is the only way

                                                                                            10
that innovative services will prosper and grow in the EU, something desparately important
to a large region with technological development lagging behind other global competitors.




   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for
      all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
      impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
      ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
      countries)?

      reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for
      all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
      impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to
      redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

   7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
      market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
      availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
      level of protection for right holders?

 YES – Please explain


                                                                                       11
    Decisive innovative legislation is irrefutably needed. Not only does the unopposed and
    continued unequal digital market go against the Union's founding principles; the harmful
    global indecision requires a leader in digital and copyright policy to lead us out of the 1980s
    and rebalance markets in favour of those who adapt, instead of old relics like Sony
    Entertainment and Elsevier who are bullies in both industry and European citizens' private
    lives. Restricting media sharing fines, controlling license provisions and legal penalties, and
    giving legal frameworks for digital exchange of media - that transfer some ownership on
    purchase - will improve consumer experience while protecting content creators. Harmonised
    legislation that is forcibly applied to all digital media interactions inside the EU and
    identical across member states is the way to start alleviating these problems, and creates an
    enormous global market for creativity.

   E.Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
   authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

1. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
   The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
   environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
   field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
   software17 and databases18.

   Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
   are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
   protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
   networks.

   The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
   authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
   16
      Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
   certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
   17
      Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
   of computer programs.
   18
      Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
   databases.
   19
      Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
   respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
   referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
   matter”.
   20
      The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
   in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
   a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
                                                                                                                   12
   e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
   at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
   communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
   dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
   transmissions and both need to be cleared.

2. The act of “making available”

   Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
   upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
   “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
   territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
   need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
   only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
   countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
   Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
   a certain Member State's public 22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
   (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
   service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
   country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
   a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

           content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

   must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
   State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
   Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
   with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
   copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

    The volume of cases around the ambiguity of "making available" answers this directly: yes!

    available" is too weak as it stands.

3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

   Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
   law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
   transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
   licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
   persons/entities.

        10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
            two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
            a download) create problems for you?

     YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address
    such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands,
    legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

    The application of two rights massively slows down data sharing across member states (not
    just media, but e.g. research). This damages us all, and is a prime case of missing
    harmonisation.

pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
         protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
         subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

 This is utterly impractical, and does not connect to the real world: if I describe how to find
 something, I should not have to ask permission first; how would one help lost drivers, or
 give directions to the hospital, or explain how to find a romantic corner of the woods? The
 analogy maps directly to this provision of online linking. Such provisions as this directly
 reduce transparency: they permit e.g. political parties to hide embarrassing content while
 keeping it available, instead making it the fault of the expositor. It is a lazy provision
 designed to protect those who cannot manage the content they post online, and very likely to
 damage young businesses and non-profit organisations who do not have the resources
 required to build a normal online presence.

    This is an intrinsic part of the normal operation of a computer. Malice to take advantage of
    the temporary reproduction would require extensive effort, and even then would only result
    in a personal, individual representation of the work or other subject matter. In this case, the
    individual creating the copy should responsibly handle it - but creating the copy is a natural
    process and ridiculous to try to limit. This would only serve to directly hamper innovation
    and the range of technologies available to EU citizens. For comparison, electric
    representations of images are created in our visual cortex as we see things with our eyes;
    should we have to license our brains?

5. Download to own digital content

   Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
   Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
   (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
   distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
   article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
   distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
   also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
   (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
   notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
   keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
   the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
   a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
   second-hand market for physical goods).

        13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
            trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

   27
     See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
   28In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
   hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
   period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
   exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
   case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
   emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
   exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
   56).
                                                                                                                  16

 science, I have to use unusual software on all my computers (Debian operating system
 instead of e.g. Mac or Windows), and due to copyright restrictions and software license
 conflicts, was unable to listen to the media on this software - and unable to get a refund.
 Licencing restrictions were the sole problem here. I have not bought downloadable digital
 media since, because some of it is broken in the EU (this was an Amazon product - not a
 minority vendor).

     14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
         consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
         purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

 [Open question]

 Digital goods, and the creators and consumers of digital goods, would begin to have some
 of the same rights that they have had for centuries over physical goods. This is an entirely
 different kind of digital divide - where the digital is behind.




F.Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

     15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
         and licensing of works and other subject matter?

  YES

  NO

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
                                                                                                             17
  NO OPINION



     16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

 [Open question]

 Finding out how to license and share content across member borders is at the moment
 difficult and expensive. Such a registry would provide a framework for the eventual
 streamlining of this process.




     17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

 [Open question]

 A mandatory system would incur moderate cost and require dialogue with right holders. in
 comparison to the many people who would access information in the registry, this would be
 a minimal effort.




     18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

 [Open question]

 Streamlined cross-border sharing. Extra or guaranteed protections for participants. Access to
 certain legal defenses. In fact, rightholders who did not participate could have a weak
 defense in case of copyright claims, as they may have not tried hard enough to assert their
 claim in the first place.




G.How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such

31 E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.
                                                                                                       18
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?

 [Open question]

 The EU should refrain from creating new standards: many strong example standards are
 already available, and adopting or supporting these will bring the rightholders who already
 use them.




H.Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

     20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
         environment?

 Existing legislation harms innovation and creativity, while failing to directly serve original
 rightholders. Currently copyrighted material remains protected up to 70 years after the death
 of the author. Moreover, sometimes this is counted from another date and the death of the
 author and it is not always clear who all the authors of a work are (for example, for songs).
 That is confusing and excessively long if you think that the purpose of copyright is to enable
 artists, writers to create.



  NO OPINION

             I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
                                                                                                            20
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

     21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
         provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

[Open question]

Removing exceptions is unacceptable. A flexible approach is required, making mandatory
the current exceptions and adding "fair use" or similar principles. Creativity is hampered by
such a concept, and retaining it does not serve industry or the individual.




   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater

 NO – Please explain why

We need more harmonisation across Europe and all further steps should be made with this
in mind. Therefore any proposed new flexibility must be scrutinised under this aspect.
However, the current system is broken; exceptions are narrow, specific and technologically
outdated: the list was written in 2001. This is before online streaming video became
common, before social networks, before any apps. It is desparately outdated, which reduces
its palatability and smooth integration.

       27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to

           addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
           whom, where?)
     [Open question]
 This doesn't seem to matter much; there is no evidence that the absence of cross-border
 compensation is harmful. Quite the opposite, in fact; breaking into foreign markets is
 already tough, and being able to seep in organically can lead to spontaneous growth.




Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal

Preservation and archiving

      The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
      cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
      works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
      works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
      laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
      from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
      types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
      of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
      new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
      content) is often uncertain.

          28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
              problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
              or other subject matter in your collection?
       (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
       by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
       exception?

          29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
       [Open question]
       By clearing up the scope of current legislation, so reproductions can be made as long as not
       intended for profit or other commerical advantage.




          30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
              elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
              under which conditions?
       [Open question]
       Legislation needs to cover the digital world. Preservation is important, but only useful if
       accessible. Public access and use will generate the momentum needed for public support -
       which is likely massive, especially in the under-40s.


                                                                                                 24

    five years.



1. Off-premises access to library collections
   Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
   matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
   premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
   consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
   the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
   between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
   should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
   collections.
        32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
           problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
           to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
           thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-
    matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries
    when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?

    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
    institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
    across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of
    research and private study?
    [Open question]
    I've given up and ended up using the local institution's agreements. I'm not sure if this is
    legal, but it works and generates no commercial advantage. If rights cannot be borrowed in
    this manner, there are so many different rightholding organisations to deal with that the
    paperwork and communication volume becomes infeasibly overwhelming.




        33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
    [Open question]
    Perhaps the broadening of the exception in article 5(3)n of the Copyright Directive could
    lead to collections used for science being more broadly available. This would save all of us
    researchers a great deal of time - we wrote the documents in the first place, and it is quite

2. E – lending
   Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
   also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
   technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
   such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
   need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
   various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
   business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
   to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
       36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
          when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
          including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
    including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries

3. Mass digitisation
   The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
   libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
   an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
   Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
   whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
   EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
   digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
   found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
   efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
   and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
   authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
   projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
   currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
   available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
   44        You will find more information about his MoU on                      the   following   website:

Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

     40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
         mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
         Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
         results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
         collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can
         be accessed across the EU?

  YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved

 This memorandum is unlikely to make a practical effect. Stronger legislation and a stronger
 campaign is required. Mass digitisation is silently happening in some states, but citizens do
 not expect it, and so it remains a cold topic.

  YES – Please explain

 Citizens have a legitimate interest in having online access to the collections of all publicly
 accessible libraries, museums and archives across Europe. There is no good reason to
 constrain this.

collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

I.Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

        42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-
            matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
 (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
 resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration
 for teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain

 Member implementations of the EU exception for teaching are too cautious and weak for
 this part of the directive to have had a major effect. We re-create all our slides and materials
 when teaching in different member states, which is labourious.

 Only a strong legislative approach can work; the extent to which the exception was adopted
 by members is evidence for this.




J.Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

        47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject
            matter in the context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

 resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of

 Every day - access is required to some paper or other written and published within the EU; I
 can't read the week's new publications on my laptop because I'm at home / travelling. It's
 painful, and work produced in these environments often goes unread. Big publishers like
 Elsevier and Springer are prepared to move to jump through whatever legislative hoops are
 put in place, regarding open access. This may in part be due to problems with their revenue
 model. The potential impact that the union can have on sharing research, not just in the EU
 but across the world, is therefore large.

 A minimal step would be for academic publications submitted in support of EU projects

 available to all EU citizens. This would radically change the copyright policies of
 organisations like the ACM and the Lancet in favour of better access to research for those
 that need it. Content creators and often rightholders are typically citizens who receive no
 remuneration, so impact on compensation will be close to zero.

K.Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the

L.Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use

51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.
                                                                                                32
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

     53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
         you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data
         mining methods, including across borders?

 including across borders?

 I am unaware of any such restrictions. As an EU-funded text miner, unrestricted basic text
 mining is fundamental to research progress.

   54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
It is possible to extract and infer potentially sensitive information from documents. For
example, in practice (and from personal experience as an academic researcher in text
mining), clinical notes can never be successfully anonymised without reducing the value of
the content: one can very often find identifying markers for a certain proportion of patients.
As a result, text and data miners bear some responsibility for the privacy of others, and
certainly should be careful how this data is shared. As another example: we find it
impossible to share data discussed over twitter. This US-based company's social messages
have been mined to great effect in epidemiology (leading to a system that predicts with over
80% accuracy if you will become ill in the next 8 days, by A.Sadilek at U. Rochester),
earthquake prediction (now in use by the USGS and Japanese earthquake authority),
identification of paedophiles (ongoing work in Madrid), bushfire detection and management
(from the Australian government), and the spread of West Nile Virus (with outbreaks
predicted from twitter data a day earlier, by researchers at U. Wisconsin). Each of these
applications has tremendous positive impact on the public. However, Twitter stipulate that
messages published on their website in the public domain can only be held if the author
doesn't choose to delete them. As we must mine terabytes of this data, we are constantly
checking with Twitter for deleted tweets, and they impose limits on the number of checks.
So, we cannot share data with others, and we cannot maintain the data as they require. If
data that was in the public domain can be legally archived and shared by researchers, we
will save vast amounts of time and make the EU the leading area for this promising and
already-fruitful area of research. The real thing that must be treated carefully is the results of
the analysis. As well as placing duties on data and text miners, critically, those who create
text or have personal, private text about them (e.g. clinical notes) mined, should have to
actively choose to permit mining. Placing a document on the web achieves this in the case
of web pages, but for other documents, given the strong and increasing power of text
mining, it is critical that privacy is respected.




   55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
We need a specific exception for text and data mining, that also explicitly states that
technical protection measures (TPMs) and contracts should not override such an exception.
Such an exception should also not differentiate between commercial and non-commercial
activities, as such a differentiation is not in the public interest. Critically, we need a
clarification of the types of data that may be mined, and a requirement for miners to actively
                                                                                             34
 gain approval of individuals about whom personal information is shared. Once published,
 the burden no longer lies on the text miner to deal with information.




     56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
 [Open question]
 Only a legislative solution will sufficiently protect individuals and research.




     57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
         text or data mining methods?
 From a practical/technical point of view, technical protection measures (TPMs) can prevent
 users from downloading content in order to ‘mine’ it. This notably impedes research.




M.User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.
                                                                                                           35
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

            I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

     21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
         the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
  YES – Please explain

 In the digital environment the legality of private copying is uncertain and differs from one
 Member State to another. This slows communication and innovation. There is absolutely an
 eminent, painfully craved need for clarification at EU level.

     22. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
         a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
         rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain

 This proposal is complex and needs to be unravelled before discussion. Supporting levies
 based on such a murky concept is likely to be harmful and embarrassing.

     23. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
         (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
         copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
         business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
 [Open question]

 Paying fees for theoretical infringements is essentially speculative punishment. This is a
 gross and abhorrent idea. We already have enough speculative billing in digital media and
 goods (e.g. the levy on blank DVDs and CDs in Finland and Denmark), none of which
 apply to non-digital goods. Barriers to innovation should be removed and real financial
 harm demonstrated satisfactorily before even considering this line.




     24. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
        products subject to levies?60
  YES – Please explain

 There must be an opt-out or alternative provided. If a levy system applies, users should be
 informed about: 1) How much is being charged; 2) For what purpose; and, 3) How the
 money is being used.

  NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

     25. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
         undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
         the free movement of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
 payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement
 schemes could help to remedy the situation.

 Buying digital goods from the UK while in Denmark resulted in the addition of 25%

     26. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
         persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
         transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
         provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
 [Open question]
 Undue payments include speculative, prejudiced fees that assume one will copy the media.
 Fees based on supposed rightholder harm must be demonstrated in courts and on a case-by-
 case basis; as it stands, they simply serve to take money from citizens to rightholders, based
 unsubstantiated claims that are declared by the rightholders. This is a painfully unbalanced
 situation.

        27. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To
            what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
            existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
 [Open question]
 All digital media trade.




        28. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
            system, how would these problems best be solved?

 [Open question]

 Removal of the system, to be replaced with a requirement for demonstration of harm before
 money is paid. Punishing individuals in advance for undemonstrated possible future licence
 breaches without any kind of legal process is a backward and inappropriate system, where
 rightholder organisations have bent governments to their will.




                I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

        21. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
            combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
            for the exploitation of your works and performances?
 [Open question]


62   See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

 The economics that this question assumes seem to be flawed. Remuneration implies that
 something was lost. This is not the case with digital goods. The entire economic process and
 conceptual framework must be re-thought if they are to work.




     22. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
         contracts)?
  YES – Please explain

 Circumventions to contracts are damaging; continued EU-level harmonisation against these
 is helpful to both consumers and rightholders.



  NO – Please explain why

  NO OPINION


     23. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
         address the shortcomings you identify?
 [Open question]
 The idea of ownership is the one thing that does not transfer from the physical to the digital,
 and yet it seems to be the one part of existing legislation where rules and thinking are
 similar between the digital and the physical. There is a need to undertake a thorough
 analysis of the economics underlying the creation and dissemination of culture, since
 currently it is often wrongly assumed that every use of work should be remunerated in order
 to satisfy creators’ interests. A cap on existing charges and a better consumer concept of
 "ownership" are required first. If one pays for content, one should not have to jump through
 hoops to use it; we have less agency over how we manage our content than we do with
 physical media. DRM locks out many and there is no recourse where it fails. Whatever need
 is articulated by others in this section, it remains crucial that it should not interfere with
 individuals' right to grant free licenses or to not participate in the further exploitation of
 their works.



            I.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
64 Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
                                                                                                      42
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

     21. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
         infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain

 Yes, but what about criminal enforcement? Why is this not addressed in this consultation?

     22. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
         involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
         brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
         online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
         would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
 [Open question]
 No, it is not clear enough. Intermediaries must have limited liability, else a very strong bias
 is introduced in their activities, leading to censorship, limited expression, and so on - all
 harmful things. Privatised enforcement is not the solution; a rigourous legal solution must
 be built.




     23. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
         achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
         as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

65 You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66 For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend

on the volume of traffic.
67 This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by

Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
                                                                                                           43
 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO – Please explain

The balance is in favour of rightholders, especially when contrasted with creators. Users are
generally secondary. Copyright should aim to encourage creativity and innovation for the
benefit of the society as a whole. Current EU copyright law fails to achieve this, as the
notion of consumers’ rights is absent. The analogy of digital content as physical goods is
harmful, yet has been extended to add concepts such as theft, a misconception that only
serves to benefit digital rightholders. This analogy needs to disappear in order for balance to
be reached.

              I.A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

    21. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
        a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
        copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION



    22. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
        current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
        longer term project?
[Open question]
The huge differences in state policies, and the only increasing nature of the digital market,
makes this an urgent issue. The present inbalance causes damage to individuals until a
solution is reached. Making this a longer term project increases the damage. Further, the


                                                                                             44
Wittem Code results demonstrate directly that it is possible to come up with a unified,
harmonised EU copyright law.




          I.Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

    21. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
        copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
Uncertainty about legality stops us sharing information. This is an activity critical to daily
life and to research in modern life, with increasing volumes required and exchanged every
days. A clear legislative solution is needed. In addition, the use of technical protection
measures (like DRM) restricts who can use content and how it can be used. This makes
digital content less flexible and less useful than physical, putting digital consumers at a
disadvantage. From a professional point of view as a reserach computer scientist, they are
always trivial to circumvent, and do not block what they're meant to, especially at larger
scales. The use of such measures should be sanctioned. A lack of unity in member laws
creates a divide, and a resultant lack of sharing. Conversely, unifying legislation at EU level
and making key sections mandatory creates a huge market. The EU should strive for this
unified solution, and the fiscal and diversity benefits that it brings for individual, creators
and rightholders alike.
