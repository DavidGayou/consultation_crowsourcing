    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A. Why is it not possible to access many online content
services from anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital
transmissions and the segmentation of the market through
licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of
national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by
the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of
the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country
basis under national law 1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music
streaming service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an
authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the
public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-
European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States
and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-
territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management 2
should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for
online services 3; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”4 and
market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition 5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border
portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their
Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement
affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of
cross-border portability 6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and
access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they
live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face
problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even
if the “same” service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the
1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective management
of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the inter-
nal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

service across borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if they try to
access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one
designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated
with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end
users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium
term 7 to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market,
while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1. Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU
Member State other than the one in which you live?
YES
“DAV: The territorial effect of copyright protection leads to different regimes not in
copyright law which is harmonised to a large extent but in other fields of law and often
to differences regarding the price of the service. It also leads to higher costs regarding
management and legal advice. Moreover differences exist regarding the contents of the
copyright-product between the national territories following the territorial lines of
copyright protection. Another consequential effect of the territoriality of copyright law is
the existence of differences in the collective rights management.”


2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across
borders in the EU?
YES
“DAV: The differences in other fields of law concern mainly tax law, regulatory law,
consumer law. The difference of copyright contents is to be found in the premium
content of the copyright-product.”


3.      How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please
indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.


“DAV: Lawyers specialised in copyright law are often asked to give legal advice
regarding multi-state or trans-border copyright licenses (e.g. music, film, literature).”


4.     If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
above – what would be the best way to tackle them?




7
  For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing a single
title) see section VII of this consultation document.
                                                   -8-



 “DAV: A Union-wide copyright would have practical consequences (1) in Union-wide
contents (2) in increasing the pressure regarding harmonisation in the fields of law
indicated and in the collective rights management.”


5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
countries)?
YES
“DAV: Users may be content with territorial licenses, because the fees in different
regions may be different (lower in less developed regions). But that would be possible
also under a Union-wide protection, as in Union-regimes regarding trademarks and
patents.”


6. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he
is trying to access)?
YES
“DAV: Mainly cost reasons, see above. But also differences in the applicable law, see
above.”


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
level of protection for right holders?
YES
“DAV: A Union-wide copyright protection would lead to a greater single market by
increasing the pressure regarding harmonisation in many adjacent fields of law.
The answers in the following part B. are based on the present situation of territorial
copy-right.”

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of
what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital
transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 8 on the harmonisation of

8
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
                                                       -9-



certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU
directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to
the protection of software 9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 11
which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and
other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or
similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right
to authorise or prohibit the making of copies 12, (notably relevant at the start of the
transmission – e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy
of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to
authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks 13. These rights
are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right
(e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor
where the act of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act
is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is
potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively
accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's
public 14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be
licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online service
provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific country
when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language
or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO

  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of
computer programs.
10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respec-
tively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is referred to as a
“work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in
any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of a
transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or
prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined Cas-
es C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however,
adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

“DAV: The concept of "targeting" developed in the decisions of the CJEU raises
practical problems which would be largely diminished by a Union-wide protection. As
long as such protection does not exist, a legislative act clarifying the standards of that
concept would be helpful.”


9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right
have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered
to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your
rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including
the availability of injunctive relief15)?
YES
“DAV: A clarification would help in safeguarding the authors right since it would create
more legal certainty regarding the enforcement of rights and gaining court protection.”

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology
and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may
complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by
different persons/entities.

10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
YES
“DAV: The application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation clearly
creates difficulties in enforcing the right. The country-of-origin-approach does not
recommend itself, because it would favour the states with low protection. This problem,
of course, would not exist under a Union-wide copyright law.”

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to
another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several
cases are pending before the CJEU16 in which the question has been raised whether
the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making
available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary
copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and
in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU17 as
to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary
acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.


15
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement
of his/her right.
16
    Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).
17
    Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See also
http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.
                                                       - 11 -



11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
“DAV: A hyperlink should only lead to the place where to find the protected object and
should not go beyond, i.e. show the contents of the protected object (embedded links,
framing).”


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the
screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
“DAV: The conditions should be clarified defining the borders between the right of
information and the use of the content in disseminating the content. If the content has
been made available by the right-holder the right of information should prevail.”

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to
own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in
this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU
exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical
copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)18. The issue that arises
here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission
equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the
copy) 19. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of
such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after
they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and delete” question) as
well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies
of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for
physical goods).

13. Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
NO OPINION
“DAV: No experience.”



18
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
19
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand
licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited period of time.
The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its
first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in case of computer pro-
grams offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached this
decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule constituted a lex spe-
cialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
                                                       - 12 -



14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of
content) concerned.
“DAV: That depends of course from the contents of the legal framework. The simple
application of the exhaustion-principle would not be adequate for solving the conflict of
interests. The application of the law of contract would lead to a fragmented situation.
Therefore, a special solution in copyright-law must be developed.”

C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a
good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international
treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute 20. Moreover a system of registration
does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection
and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased
opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older
works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages
and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered 21.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
YES, a non-compulsory system free of charge open for worldwide users, financed by
the collective rights management entities


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
 “DAV: Information”


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
 “DAV: The system would be disadvantageous if the use of it would be required for
gaining copyright protection. The system should be non-compulsory. The users should
be responsible for keeping their registration up to date.”


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
 “DAV: No incentive needed, because the user will benefit from its existence.”

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are

20
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the formalities
as opposed to works originating in another country.

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 Oc-
tober 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being set up
by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable,
internationally agreed ‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number
embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed 22,
and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire
Database 23 should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the
ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition 24 was
established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and
licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all
types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 25 is seeking to take such identification systems
a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of
rights ownership and permissions databases?
 “DAV: A central identification-system for the Union is needed. The existing systems
should be interconnected.”

E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of
time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and
can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral
rights). The Berne Convention 26 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after
the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term
provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in
international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not
benefit from such an extended term of protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
NO
“DAV: The system is out of date. But a better solution must be found within the Berne
Convention. The Union should harmonise the time limits and their starting points. As a

Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

general direction there should be a two stage system: a lower time-limit and a
remuneration regime in case of later excessive use.”

     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and
other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of
an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are
established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC27.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect
international law 28. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires
that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not
conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive
(no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 29, these
limitations and exceptions are often optional 30, in the sense that Member States are free
to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the
formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give
significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and
exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent
significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the
Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an
effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and
exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a
Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to
the Member State "B") 31.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to
compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to
their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to
provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of
fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for

31
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-border
effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an orphan work in
a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and can be used and
accessed in all Member States.

illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the
students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which
national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best
mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt
when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to
confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main
question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty,
including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international
obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES
“DAV: Harmonisation regarding private copies seems to be necessary.”

22.Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO
“DAV: Regarding hyperlinks the decision of the ECJEU in C-466/12 should be awaited.
Same regarding framing and embedding (C-348/13).”


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
“DAV: See above”

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a
greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
exceptions?
NO
“DAV: See above”

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use
or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would
be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its
possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
“DAV: See above”

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem?

YES
”DAV: Generally: Yes”


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were
to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
whom, where?)
 [Open question]

A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions
allow acts of preservation and archiving 32 and enable on-site consultation of the works
and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions33. The public lending
(under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works
and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 34.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the
objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in
digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the
prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework
agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement
of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of
these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in
their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of
the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of
beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception,
the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment
may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g.
harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.
28.(a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception
to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational
establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
NO

[Open question]

2.    Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other
subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals
on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study.
The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library
user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally
addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue
that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the
conditions for, granting online access to collections.




32. (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,
including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of
research and private study?
(b) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to consult, including
across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of
institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the
premises of the institutions in question?
(c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those
institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or
other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private
study?

and equal treatment.”

3.    E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books,
sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments
have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to
digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal
framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise
such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are
currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works
online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by
aggregators.
36. (a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across
borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or
other materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders, from
institutions such as public libraries?
(c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books
or other materials electronically, including across borders?
NO
“DAV: No problems known”

37.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one
(n° 2).

38. What differences do you see in the management of physical and online
collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems
have you encountered?

39. What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-
premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises
(online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you
encountered?

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections
with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to
the public. Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the
20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been
partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e.
works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming
to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of
licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand
and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other35.
Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive),
the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to
everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management
Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers).
Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of
representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the
licences granted) 36.

40. Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works
can be accessed across the EU?
YES
“DAV: A Union-law solution for the cross-border problem seem to be necessary.”


41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed
for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections,
broadcasters’ archives)?
YES
“DAV: Audio-visual works.”

36
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees col-
lective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz
zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.
Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works whose
rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC37 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching.
Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate
his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in
the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to
obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with
several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities
for distance learning and study at home.

42.(a) Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other
subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which
works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including
across borders?
NO

D. Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC39 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have
been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for
persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special
formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 40.

The Marrakesh Treaty 41 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates
a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce,
distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons
without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain
provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format
copies across borders).

51.If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]


52.What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to
content? How successful are they?
[Open question]

E. Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 42 are different terms used to
describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites,
databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an
analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and
trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or
accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the
databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser
cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),
prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the
making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content
accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the
exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider
that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright.
None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a
single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions
also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content)



42
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating
stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific
content were presented by publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”43. In the
context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences
should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a
subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data
mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial
and non-commercial.

text or data mining methods, including across borders?

F. [Open question] User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online
activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated
content”. While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or
several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on

43
  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .

the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs 44. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover
the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work
does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding,
subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content.
This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly
changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for
those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard
to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating
stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best
way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is
needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view
was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes
are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users
generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions45.

58.(a) Have you experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or
other subject matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across
borders?
(b) Have you experienced problems when users publish/disseminate new content
based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter through your service,
including across borders?
(c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using
pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the
Internet, including across borders?
NO
“DAV: No experience”


59.(a) Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online
use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?



44
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

     III.      Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying 46. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used
for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile
listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to
compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for
their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context,
levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether
the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file
(in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may
indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service
provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially
46
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service
providers’ licence fees 4748.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain
types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application
of the private copying and reprography exceptions 49 in the digital environment?
NO
“DAV: Art. 5(2) lit. a and b Directive 2001/29/EC does not need to be amended.”

65.Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?50
YES
“DAV: See ECJEU C-457/11-C-460/11.”

66.How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
products subject to levies? 51
YES
“DAV: Would serve transparency."

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results
in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of
private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member
States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments 52.

68.Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles
to the free movement of goods or services?
NO
“DAV: No experience.”

69.What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than
natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of
those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the
example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
 “DAV: Not known.”

70.Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect?
To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]

71.If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive
rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms,
remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the
transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers53 or determining who the
owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of
an employment contract 54. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches.
Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately
remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider
that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along
the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices,
negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules
at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

72.What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that
you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and
performances?

53
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
54
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.
                                                       - 28 -



…There is a need for a comprehensive EU law governing the transfer of rights. Where
the author or performer typically is the weaker part of the contract binding rules or the
use of collective mechanisms are necessary.

73.Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
YES
“DAV: See above.”

74.If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest
to address the shortcomings you identify?
 “DAV: See above.”

     V. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 55 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement
of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission
has consulted broadly on this text 56. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of
its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On
the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright
and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be
available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose 57. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP
infrastructure 58. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for
respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 “DAV: Double license fee in case of infringement.”

76.In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers,
advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in
inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?


55
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
56
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
57
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
58
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
                                           - 29 -



“DAV: Court practice should be allowed to develop these questions further.”

77.Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights
such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
 YES – Please explain
 NO – Please explain
 NO O P INIO N

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright
debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of
such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the
area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single
EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in
which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while
others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher
level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in
Member States’ legal systems.



78.Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
DAV: Yes


79.Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does
the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this
is a longer term project?



“DAV: After the creation of Union titles for patents, trademarks, design and plant
breeders rights a Union title for copyright seems to be the natural next step. The DAV
advocates the creation of such a title including rules on transfer and licensing and
employee-creations. An intermediary step could be a consolidation of existing
Directives.”
