                                 Intergraf contribution
                         to the EC consultation on the review
                             of the EU Copyright Directive
                                          February 2014


      Intergraf represents 23 national printing federations in 20 countries in Europe.
      Intergraf's main task is to promote and protect the interests of the printing and related
      industries. The printing industry in the 28 European countries comprises some 122,000
      firms and employs around 723,000 people. The turnover in the printing industry is
      about 87.5 billion EUR. The industry throughout Europe consists mainly of small
      enterprises, as 90% of them employ fewer than 20 persons.

      Intergraf welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the on-going consultation on the
      review of the EU copyright Directive. Our contribution focusses on chapter IV of the
      consultation dedicated to private copying and reprography.

21.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
        the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

      We would like to draw your attention to an aspect which has not been addressed yet.
      In the context of a review of the Copyright Directive, there is a need to clarify that
      industrial/professional printing machines should not be considered as a device subject
      to a copyright levy. Industrial printing machines are equipment used by printing
      companies; this equipment has to be differentiated from the equipment used by
      individuals or offices. A printing company typically has different types of equipment
      (called presses), including digital printing machines enabling to print from a digital-
      based image to paper or other substrates.
      These professional printing machines are not used by individuals for private copying
      but for professional use under a contract with a customer. Customers of printing
      companies are either rightholders (authors) or have already paid their compensation to
      the rightholder (example: for the re-printing of a book, the publisher who is the
      customer of the printing company would initially pay copyright fees to the rightholder).
      Imposing an ‘operator levy’ on printing companies could on one hand potentially lead to
      instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of licence fees.
      On the other hand it implies higher printing costs for customers, ie authors, publishers.
      In this case, the levy has the opposite effect to that intended as it ultimately punishes
      rightholders.
      The fact that industrial printing machines are not included in the levies for private
      copying or reprography has to be clearly stipulated in the Directive for reasons of legal
      certainty and legal harmonisation in the EU.

24.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
        subject to levies?

      Making levies visible on invoices, in our specific case on invoices issued by printers,
      would make the possible double payment made by authors and publishers transparent
      (see answer to question 21). Double payment would occur if reprography levies are
      claimed in addition to the original licence fee.
25.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
      undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
      the free movement of goods or services?

  As explained in our answer to question 21, the duplication of levy payments would
  occur in the case of a publisher who is paying both its compensation to the rightholder
  (licence fees) and the levy in the printing costs of its publication.
  As stated in question 21, it is key to ensure that professional (industrial) printing
  machines are not considered as device subject to a reprography levy as it would further
  deteriorate the economic situation of the European printing sector. A large proportion of
  European books are already printed outside Europe because of lower production costs.
  Imposing further financial burden on European printing companies will further increase
  the competitive advantage of non-European printing companies. It is crucial to preserve
  the high cultural value of printed products in Europe.
  Moreover any levy (in particular an ‘operator levy’) imposed on printing companies in a
  differentiated way across Member States would significantly distort the European
  printing market and create an obstacle to the free movement of printed products. The
  levy would artificially make some printed products more expensive in some Member
  States compared to others.
