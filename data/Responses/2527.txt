          Telecom Italia’s response to the Public Consultation
                on the review of the EU copyright rules

Introduction
Telecom Italia, as main ICT Group in Italy, welcomes the opportunity to reply to the
European Commission’s Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules.
Considering the characteristics of the digital markets, Telecom Italia recognize the importance
to establish clear and harmonised rules on this matter, so as to simplify distribution and legal
access to contents along with rightholders’ protection.


TYPE OF RESPONDENT


   Intermediary/Distributor/Other service provider (e.g. online music or audiovisual
    service, games platform, social media, search engine, ICT industry) OR
    Representative of intermediaries/distributors/other service providers
       for the purposes of this questionnaire normally referred to in questions as "service
      providers"


Please, find below Telecom Italia’s answers to a selection of questions within the
consultation.




                                                                                              1
   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
Telecom Italia doesn’t provide cross border services mainly as a consequence of business
decisions. However, even if Telecom Italia decided to extend the geographical reach of its
digital services, it would not be easily feasible, due to the agreements with rightholders which
usually grant the licence on a national basis.
  NO
  NO OPINION
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


                                                                                              2
5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION
6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
Holding multi-territorial rights is a necessary but not sufficient condition to provide cross
border services. Among the main obstacles, not directly related to copyright’s issues, are
those connected to security, privacy, consumer protection and taxation.
The distribution of some types of digital contents (e.g. music, books) requires the adoption of
security measures (e.g. the Digital Right Management) that differ across European countries.
To comply with security rules, major technical investments in platforms are often required,
therefore limiting the number of providers with sufficient resources.
Also on privacy issues, the national laws differ across EU thus making it difficult to make an
offer compatible with all the different requirements.
As for consumer protection, the distance sale of digital content is treated differently across the
EU. For example, in Italy, the digital goods are considered equivalent to the physical goods
whereas in other European countries this equivalence is not recognized.
Taxation on digital goods, today inhomogeneous, should also be made consistent across EU.




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
Efforts have to be made to simplify the whole scheme of licences granting across borders.
National laws should be harmonised so as to favour the diffusion of multi-territorial licences
thus ensuring copyright protection, but also fostering the development of innovative pan-
European services that wouldn’t otherwise be commercially viable.


                                                                                                 3
In this framework, a review of the current release windows system would also be necessary,
so as to allow legal access to digital works within a reasonable timeframe.
     NO – Please explain

     NO OPINION

A.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
1.         The act of “making available”
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach1)
The case law in Italy has so far not given sufficiently clear guidance on the cross border
extension of the “making available” right. Some scholars propose that the same rules should
apply as in satellite broadcasting, a matter which is specifically ruled by Art. 16 bis of the
Copyright Law (Law 633 - 22-04-1941). This article of the law provides that satellite
transmission occurs in Italy if the transmission content is uploaded to the satellite from a
station based in Italy or on behalf of a broadcaster based in Italy. Further clarification on the
issue in relation to digital transmission would be helpful and welcome.
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief2)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION

1
  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
2
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                                4
2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.    [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?
         – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
The application of two rights on a single act of economic exploitation complicates the trading
of rights and could thus constitute a barrier to the legal diffusion of digital content. Since they
are both necessary for the economic exploitation of contents, measures should be taken to
favour the bundling of the reproduction right and the making available right.
     NO
     NO OPINION

3.        Linking and browsing

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
On the basis of the interpretation of the Italian Copyright law and case law, a hyperlink to a
website or to a content present on the web can be considered generally authorized, even
without an explicit indication. What needs to be authorized is the first upload of the content,
not any link on the web which refers to that content.
This interpretation was recently confirmed by the European Court of Justice’s decision on the
Svensson case which states “making available the works concerned by means of a clickable
link, such as that in the main proceedings, does not lead to the works in question being
communicated to a new public” and therefore hyperlink didn’t require a specific authorization
of the relevant rightholders, considering that “access to the works was not subject to any
restrictive measures”.
     NO OPINION




                                                                                                 5
12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Browsing and caching should be included in the mandatory copyright exception for temporary
acts of reproduction, as they don’t amount to reproduction or distribution of the work. In other
words, as long as browsing and caching are not meant to give users the full benefit of a
copyrighted content or a substantial portion of it (e.g. viewing film trailers), they shouldn’t be
subject to the authorization of the rightholders.
     NO OPINION

4.         Download to own digital content
13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

B.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
     NO OPINION




                                                                                                6
16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Telecom Italia agrees on what the Commission states in the Recommendation on the
digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation (2011):
“Rights information databases connected at European level can bring down transaction costs
for rights clearance. Such mechanisms should therefore be encouraged in close cooperation
with all stakeholders”.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Such a registration system would be complex and costly to implement. Mechanisms to
involve all the relevant stakeholders should be thoroughly studied.
18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
Copyright rules might be made stricter on works belonging to registered rightholders.
Rightholders would then feel more protected when registered in this system at the EU level.

C.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The clear identification of works and relevant rightholders is pivotal for the development of
digital services and thus for the innovation in this specific market. As a result, the
development and interoperability of open and transparent identifiers and databases should be
fostered at the EU level.

D.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
The terms of protection are today too long to comply with the characteristics of the digital
markets.
  NO OPINION




                                                                                           7
  II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
EU copyright rules should be as harmonised as possible both at the benefit of rightholders,
that should have a clear picture of how their works could be treated at the EU level, and of the
service providers which could implement cross-border services without the burden of
considering all the differences among countries, which would most probably raise legal, but
also technical issues. In this framework, the consumers would eventually benefit from the
launch of new services and from clearer and simplified rules on how to access to content
legally at the EU level.
  NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
………………….…………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why

                                                                                              8
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
The EU copyright framework should avoid, ex-ante, cross-border effects coming from
limitations and exceptions established at national level.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
(b) As a service provider, Telecom Italia has so far followed the approach of agreements with
data providers as a basis for data mining services. Nevertheless, we think that copyright might
potentially represent a barrier to data mining services exploiting general data which cannot be
attributed to a specific owner (such as, data commonly available on the Internet).

55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
A general exception to copyright, allowing for the analysis and processing of data, would
make it possible to open up new businesses in the field of data mining and big data. Since
such exception would need to be consistent with the laws on personal data protection, which
at the moment represent a strong barrier for European companies in this field, amendments to
the relevant laws should be considered.

56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
As far as data and text mining is concerned, Telecom Italia, as a service provider, has so far
faced obstacles and restrictions mainly in relation to data privacy and protection of personal
data.

F.     User-generated content
58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO – Please explain by giving examples
(b) It is necessary to make a distinction between: 1) works of known market players which are
distributed along with contents belonging to other commercial entities (e.g. broadcasters
which distribute contents belonging to motion-picture studios); 2) works of unknown owners
which can be modified in form or substance by other users.
In the first case, Telecom Italia deems possible for a service provider to distribute a specific
content only after the authorization of the relevant rightholder. For instance, a service
provider interested in distributing a broadcaster’s offer, should have the authorization of the
different rightholders of the contents that the broadcaster is proposing (e.g. motion-picture
studio for a movie).



                                                                                                 16
In the second case, the digital content is uploaded/created by a user through a
platform/application of the service provider (e.g. chat, community). Users, in this case, are
required to accept specific terms and conditions that usually state the gratuity of the service
across-border and specify the responsibility of the users for the content uploaded.


  NO OPINION


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
At the moment, Telecom Italia doesn’t provide specific tools to identify rights for further
online use of works uploaded by users. The reason lies on the assumption that users (i.e.
owners of the contents distributed through Telecom Italia’s service) are free to indicate the
degree, if any, to which they authorize for further use of their work (e.g. any use beyond that
in relation to Telecom Italia service). A common way to apply this method is the “Creative
Commons” framework.
  NO OPINION


60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?

    III.     Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions3 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
In Telecom Italia's view, there's a need to clarify the scope and application of private copying
exemptions, due to the different implementation at national level. Levies are one of the topics
that show how each of the EU Member States has adopted different regimes. While some
countries such as UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus have adopted (due to different
reasons) rules which do not take into account levies for private copies, those that apply them
can show differences in methodology of application.
     NO – Please explain

     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?4

 Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          18
         – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
       – Please explain
According to Telecom Italia, levies should not be requested when devices and equipment are
used for private copying of contents already legally bought by the user/consumer, as the
copyrights have been already paid by the distributor/audiovisual service provider to the owner
of the copyright according to specific agreements of distribution. If not, double payments are
due, thus creating a burden that may become heavier and heavier for some sectors of the
digital industry.



66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products

    NO OPINION
68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

 IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain

  V.      Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
According to Telecom Italia, the civil enforcement system in EU and the subsequent
implementation at national level are still providing appropriate actions against those
responsible for infringements of copyright and there is no need to modify it even in presence
of infringements with a commercial purpose.
  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Directive 2004/48/EC still plays a fundamental role in protecting IPRs also in the digital and
Internet environment in Europe. Its rules are in balance with those foreseen by other main
directives applicable to the digital market, such as the E-commerce and Privacy Directives. In
other words, enforcing IPR should not be aimed at encouraging actions in contrast with
fundamental rights (such as the right to privacy and the right to the confidentiality of
communications) nor at strengthening obligations on intermediary service providers, thus
modifying the present liability regime. More than by hardening measures or sanctions,
Telecom Italia believes that mainly a wider legal offer of digital contents (at a reasonable
price) - together with a simplified distribution, the removal of the existing barriers and
shortened release windows - could limit IPRs infringements.


                                                                                           21
77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title

  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
