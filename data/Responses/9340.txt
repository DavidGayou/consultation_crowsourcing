     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)


The difficulties surrounding the right of making available can be attributed to two facts. First,
the transposition of the reference in the 1996 WIPO Treaties to a species of the right of
communication to the public - the making available right - without giving any guidance how it
should work in the digital environment. Second, the continuation of a century old territorial
and analogue-based administration of rights seeking to ‘fit’ new digital uses into old
categories of rights.
Multiple payments or an inability to license leading to fragmentation and underserved
markets are obvious consequences. For example, a video platform could be charged for
multiple rights: reproduction, communication to the public, and making available, while due
to disputes about where the video is “made available” and who owns what rights in which
territories, the video cannot be exploited in a number of Member States. Too often, in
territories where there are different collecting societies or licensors administering each right,

21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                              11
each one wants to be paid for the same activity by claiming that separate rights are
implicated, including rights that have no independent economic value. One might claim
royalties for the act of simply loading files to a server connected to the Internet, even if no one
ever accesses those files. Another might claim royalties for the act of transmission, while a
third would do the same for the reproduction right even in the absence of downloads because
temporary copies are made as a necessary adjunct of the transmission. Businesses cannot be
expected to efficiently conclude commercial contract in such circumstances.
In a functional licensing market, distinguishing between rights does not make sense where
there is a single act of exploitation. A contract might cite all the relevant rights -
reproduction, communication to the public, making available, distribution - but could more
generally state that the license would convey all rights necessary to use the work community-
wide. Thus in a well-functioning market, online music services would be striking licences with
copyright owners for all required rights and all EU territories. The objective is not to pay
less, but instead to eliminate transaction costs and deadweight loss, as a multitude of local
gatekeepers create fragmentation.
A true copyright law for the digital age should avoid adding more layers on to existing rights,
and give guidance as to where the act of making available takes place and whether it can take
place in more than one Member States. The Commission’s Consultation is a welcome effort to
address these pressing questions. However, the recent reform of collecting societies could
have been an opportunity to ensure collecting societies use categories of rights which
correspond to economic exploitations, as was (sensibly) initially foreseen under the so-called
‘GEMA’ decisions.
In particular, while both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the InfoSoc Directive treat the
making available right as a type of communication to the public, the notion of public is
central. E.g. signing to oneself in the shower should not be a copyright infringement. To fall
within the right, the work must be available to the public, and not merely privately, and this is
true even if one talks about a “new public”, which cannot exist when one makes a work
available to only a single person.

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

Under no circumstances should linking be subject to the authorisation of a rightholder. We
believe any other answer would undermine the internet and have nefarious social and
economic consequences.
As underlined by the opinion of many scholars under the ‘European Copyright Society’ 27, this
would amount to a significant expansion of copyright and seriously undermine freedom of
expression. As Tim-Berners Lee, who is regularly accredited as being an inventor of the
World Wide Web, explained, a standard hyperlink is nothing more than a reference or
footnote, and that the ability to refer to a document is a fundamental right of free speech.
From a copyright perspective, a link is not a use of a work in copyright law as it is neither a
transmission nor a communication. There is on new public, as a link merely points to content
already made available.
However, we note a worrying trend. The EUCJ is asked to decide such a question in 2014, the
Commission is consulting on it, in licences for Europe various publishers pledged to allow
linking to their content, and Germany has introduced new IPRs aiming to restrict the ability
to link.

Everyday interactions of users with digital technology give rise to multiple temporary digital
reproductions of fragments of content. These are essential to the functioning of digital
technologies, devices, networks, etc. The answer to these questions is critical.
First, is quite clear that, according to the UK Supreme Court in the Newspaper Licensing
Agency case28 and some academics29, requiring permission from the newspaper licensing
agency for such uses would break down the internet and “would make infringers of many
millions of ordinary users of the internet across the EU”30.

Second, this would have broad implications about the ‘right to read’. Requiring permission
from the newspaper licensing agency for browsers and screens literally subjects the right to
read content already available to new and additional permissions. In the analog world,
reading a book does not involve intermediate technical reproduction; in the digital world, any
network, software, e-reader or tablet uses temporary reproductions which could be blocked
by a rightholder. According to the UK Supreme Court, “Merely viewing or reading [a work]
is not an infringement”, and “it has never been an infringement, in either English or EU law,
for a person merely to view or read an infringing article in physical form”31.
Third, there would be obvious consequences, in subjecting reading materials on line to such
additional rightholder control, for the right to impact information and the right of the public
to receive it, as protected under the Charter
Last but not least, this is common sense. The notion that under EU law the question of
whether copies invisible to users should trigger new permissions or payments highlights that
the copyright system is liable to being abused with overbroad claims. It is also a serious
threat and burden on innovation in Europe, as digital technologies almost by definition rely
on temporary reproductions for their operation.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)32. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)33. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute34. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered35.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


An EU-wide, Berne-compliant registry system would dramatically improve licensing. Online
services devote a great deal of resources and manpower to licensing; and these attractive
legal offers are the best antidote to unauthorized works.
As the Commission itself wrote in its Recommendation of 27.10.2011 on the digitisation and
online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation: "Rights information
databases connected at European level can bring down transaction costs for rights
clearance".
It is quite obvious that no market can be efficiently organised when no information, or only
partial information, is available on who owns the property rights in question. You cannot
license a copyrighted work unless you know who owns the relevant right.
This common sense point has been widely known for a very long time. Yet, despite many good
faith efforts to conclude voluntary rights databases, these efforts have yet to deliver.
Currently, society as a whole is bearing the cost of lack of clarity on ownership of rights; for


34
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
35
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             16

works.

     NO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


Registries would have the advantage of facilitating licensing and improving legal certainty.
The full advantages of registries go beyond licensing.
As pointed out by several stakeholders, technology sheds new light on the need for, and the
feasibility of, more comprehensive registries. The vast expansion in the scope of copyright, to
cover billions of works created every day - from Facebook posts, emails, blogs as well as
traditional works- has resulted in every day activities being swept within the copyright
system. For instance WordPress users produce about 36.3 million new posts and 63.1 million
new comments every month. 130 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. There
are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on more than 22,000,000
articles in 285 languages; 41 000 posts a second on Facebook; 758 million photos are shared
everyday on the internet.
The vast majority of content created today is not done so with a view e.g. to strict
enforcement. Applying copyright rules designed for commercial exploitation to this creativity
makes little sense, and creates huge legal uncertainty for users and rightholders alike36.
Registries would be one way to reconcile these different forms of creativity, both of which
worthy.
Other advantages of registries are well documented by WIPO37: (1), right owners will have
with a simple and effective means to clearly establish authorship and/or ownership that can
be used in commercial and legal contexts; (2) Registration can also help to delimit the public
domain, and consequently facilitate access to creative content for which no authorization
from the right owner is needed; (3) national registries serve the public interest by providing a
source of national statistics on creativity and culture; (4) Finally, national registries may
constitute a repository of cultural works through deposit.


17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


A registration system that is too complex or expensive will not attract sufficient rights holders
to be valuable. At the same time unless there is a mix of incentives, a registry is also unlikely
to attract attention and buy-in.
The Creative Commons experience has shown that it is possible to build a simple platform,
without much funds, where millions of works are “signalled” on a voluntary basis.

18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


The notion that registration cannot be encouraged or subject to regulatory measures,
including incentives, for fear of non-compliance with the Berne convention is a incorrect38.
For instance, a cursory survey of current law reveals that for domestic works, registration
might be as condition to bringing of certain infringement. Other subject matter such as
phonograms, broadcasts, unoriginal databases etc. are not outside of the scope of the Berne
Convention.
Similarly, ‘Berne plus’ protection is not, by definition, constrained by the Berne Convention
whether in respect of domestic or non-domestic works. As an illustration, the protection of
TPMs, DRM (referred, strangely, as ‘RMI’ in the consultation) are not mandated by Berne.
Likewise, take down notices are not regulated under the Berne Convention.
Further, in some countries, prima facie evidence of ownership of rights is subject to securing
a certificate of registration. In Canada and a number of other countries39, for example, a
certificate of registration provides evidence that the copyright exists and that the person
registered is the owner of the copyright.
Finally, the ‘exercise’ of rights is routinely subject to formalities (e.g. French law on how
copyright contracts are to be formalised). Likewise, collecting societies can be required, in
certain countries, to have fully transparent registries as a condition for enforcing their rights.
Accordingly, we believe the EU could provide strong incentives for the ownership of works to
be better and more fully documented at the EU level. It could for instance require that
collecting societies do not enforce rights which are not documented in a public database40. It
could also limit the availability of remedies when works are not registered, such as certain
enforcement remedies, take downs notifications or the protection of TPM.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed41, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database42 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition43 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the

39
   Canadian Copyright Act, sec. 53(2)
40
   As is the case in the USA.
41
    E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub44 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?


The EU should continue its efforts in support the Global Repertoire Database efforts for
which many companies and rightholders have spent much time and effort on in the last years.
This was instigated by Neelie Kroes, and needs EU support and promotion. (APPLE) While
there was considerable momentum for this initiative while the Directive on collecting
societies was discussed, this momentum seems to be withering. The EU should envisage
measures to ensure that the GRD is implemented
However, ‘permissions databases’ are an entirely different matter. They should not distract
from the fact that the major problem faced by online service providers is not lack of
interoperability of rightholder databases, but rather lack of transparency, openness, and
ultimately the quality and quantity of the data available. In other words, addressing
interoperability of databases before they are populated with quality data, and made open, is
putting the cart before the horse..
Permissions databases also aim to contain licensing information which is machine readable.
We do not believe that this would be a positive development, for the following reasons:
- licensing agreements are complex deals, the terms of which are negotiated to reflect the
needs of a service (beyond financial terms). It is unlikely that there will ever be an
‘automatic’ process to replace commercial negotiations.
- Innovative services are by definition new services: it is difficult to see how unilaterally set
permissions could foresee the needs of such new services.
- Innovative services are by definition new services: it is difficult to see how unilaterally set
permissions could foresee the needs of such new services.
- A declaratory system of permissions, set unilaterally by rightholders, encourages abuse: if
rightholders can define themselves the conditions of licences (permissions) they are like likely
to state there should be a license when the work is not subject to protection (lack of
originality), out of protection (public domain), subject to an exception.
Given the previous experience of TPMs, and given the need to prioritise transparent
ownership databases for markets to function effectively, we believe the risks inherent in
permissions database far outweigh any advantages.
We also note that in the course of Licences for Europe, proposals were made to require users
to use identifiers for User Generated Content (UGC). Given the scale of UGC as well as the
implications for privacy and anonymity, we do not believe that such proposals should be
considered.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention45 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
         – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Given the scale of content created online today, it questionable whether a post on a social
network should be protected for 70 years after the death of its author.
An issue which has also been overlooked, regrettably, in the orphan Directive, is the term of
protection of orphan works. As the author is unknown or cannot be located in such cases, this
situation results in having to set a very conservative estimate for the expiry of the term of
protection. Such works should at least be treated as anonymous or pseudonymous works for
the purposes of calculating the term of protection.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC46.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law47. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal


45
   Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
46
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

                                                                                                              20
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 48, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional49, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")50.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
         – Please explain by referring to specific cases
From an EU law perspective, IPRs are obstacles to the free movement of goods and services –
which are scrutinised for their justification51. The difficulties in cross-border situations stem

48
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
49
    With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
50
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.
51
   I.e. the EU doctrine of exhaustion is based on this reasoning.

                                                                                                           21
from the fact that IPRs are territorial and limitations are optional and different from one MS
to the next. But the most significant obstacle to the internal market is the possible creation of
new national IPRs - which should not be permitted given the high level of harmonisation of
rights.
Optional exceptions can give rise a number of issues:
- Limitations on the free movement of goods and services: How can an arts reseller promote
the sale of artistic works online when States have enacted the relevant exception but others
have not?
- Protection of fundamental rights: some exceptions are intimately connected with
fundamental rights (quotations, parodies, etc.). These rights do not stop at the border,
European citizens and consumers should arguably have the same rights in this respect.
- Complexity: There are, technically, 2.097.152 different ways to implement the directive on
exceptions.
- Competitiveness: the economies of scale and consumer reach that could be achieved
through a digital single market are not available to consumers, companies, services,
innovators that rely on exceptions and limitations.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
        – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes, some.
The need for mandatory exceptions should be assessed taking into account in particular
whether (1) there is a detrimental impact on the internal market; (2) whether fundamental
rights and/or the public interest are a strong justification for the exception; and (3) whether
an underlying policy (i.e. economic or innovation policy) is better achieved at EU level.
At the same time Member States should be encouraged to make use of existing flexibilities for
exceptions and limitations, including with respect to the non-harmonised right of adaptation.
To some degree this allows Member States to develop new approaches to maximize the
economic, cultural and societal benefits of exceptions; these approaches in turn inform other
Member States and the EU on how to best adapt to societal and technological changes. This
also takes into account the social, cultural and economic background prevalent in individual
Member States.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


Exceptions should not be removed. Exceptions are increasingly more necessary to
counterbalance the current over-expansive reproduction right that, for example, lead to
questioning reproductions inside TV sets (Premier League); allows the Newspaper Licensing
Agency to challenge the legality of browsing; or other to questions linking - as noted in the
Consultation.
New exceptions may be necessary – new, unforeseen developments appear regularly, of which
Text and Data Mining and UGC are examples. The rise of copy-reliant technologies leads to
innovation, by definition unpredictable. Recognition tools such as Shazam, anti-plagiarism
software such as Turn It In, are examples of services which rely on reproducing a vast
number of works. They constitute non-expressive and transformative uses, which do not harm
the market for the original work, nor take away any value from those works.
However, EU wide ad hoc exceptions may only be part of the solution, as they take
considerable time to adopt and implement. For instance, it is now 6 years since the
Commission concluded that lack of a UGC exception “can be perceived as a barrier to
innovation in that it blocks new, potentially valuable works from being disseminated” (Green
Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy (COM(2008) 466/3). This time translates in
lower likelihood of investment, less innovations and a European competitiveness gap52.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
         – Please explain why
First, it important to highlight that the notion that European countries and courts cannot deal
with flexibility in copyright is a pervasive fiction. National as well as EU copyright rules
already contain several provisions which give rise to interpretation by courts.
Recent CJEU case law has shown that the exact meaning and scope of exception may remain
unclear and requires interpretation53. The CJEU also increasingly examines the
proportionality between a copyright norm and other interests including fundamental rights
protected under the Charter54. Finally, the 3-steps-test test (Art. 5.5 of the Directive 2001/2)
already provides a flexible instrument which is used by national courts as well as the CJEU55.
Second, such flexibility could be used to accommodate innovation and promote growth within
this framework. Industries that rely on exceptions and limitations that balance copyright laws
represent Euro 1.1 trillion, or 9.3 percent of the EU’s GDP. They employed close to 9 million

people and were growing 3 percent faster than the rest of the EU economy 56. The UK
government estimates that its copyright reforms will add between 0.3 and 0.6% to the UK
economy by 202057. Innovation in the digital environment it increasingly relies on
reproductions which not conflict with the normal exploitation of copyright works and do not
unreasonably prejudice the interests of rights holders58. The fact that in 2014 the CJEU is
asked to decide whether such basic activities as linking and browsing are, from a copyright
perspective, lawful, is perhaps evidence that the current framework is excessively skewed
against innovation.
Third, while online services contribute to the discoverability, accessibility and monetization of
creative works through licensing agreements, this does not stand for the proposition that
every digital technology requires a licence. In other terms, licensing is not a solution to
everything. For instance ideas, facts etc. are not subject to copyright as the burden of such a
monopoly on society would be unbearably costly. Licensing temporary reproductions would
in many cases re-constitute a monopoly on facts and ideas. Similarly, many non-consumptive
or transformative use that comply with the 3-steps-test would not accommodate licensing.
Licensing would in such cases allow e.g. a single copyright owner to potentially block or
diminish the value of the innovation (e.g. ‘hold up scenarios’), and to derive rent in a
situation where his incentives to create in the first place are not impacted.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.


The different options available for allowing innovation and copyright to co-exist require
careful consideration. However, as noted earlier, it is doubtful whether periodic revision of
the EU acquis on an ad hoc basis is able to keep pace with economic and social
developments.

It should be emphasised that there are of course already open norms in the EU, such as the
three-steps-test, or proposals such as Article 5.5. of the ‘Wittem European Copyright Code’59,
or the Irish ‘Modernising Copyright’ proposal60.
While an open ended norm at EU level is one possibility, there are others. Member States and
national courts might also be well placed to make use of existing flexibilities, in particular as
afforded under the existing right of adaptation.
We would welcome further discussion on these issues in particular. If Member States are to
be encouraged to provide new exceptions, it may be worth reflecting on how best to reconcile
these flexibilities with the internal market and European policies.
The Commission may make clear that the harmonisation of rights under the acquis is full
harmonisation, in particular that the creation of new IPR should not be pursued nationally, as
these create new obstacles to the single market and may circumvent existing exceptions.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving61 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions62. The public lending (under an exception or

limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive63.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other64. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)65.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC66 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

States level.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC68 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 69.

The Marrakesh Treaty70 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics71 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).




71
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              33
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”72. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?


         – Please explain


It is not always clear what text-and-data mining are precisely. However, under a broad
interpretation of the notion, as suggested in the consultation, it is relatively clear that many
digital technologies would rely on ‘data mining’. Generally, large volumes of information
combined with increasing computing powers provide a raft of new opportunities for
innovation, growth and competitiveness73.
In particular, new technologies for speech recognition, subtitling, software analytics, etc. rely
on large amounts of data as input, including but not limited to materials found on the

Internet. These technologies underpin the development of applications in life sciences74,
humanities75, health care76 and many other markets and applications77.
Despite some suggestions to the contrary, text and data-mining (TDM) is not currently, and
cannot be, subject to copyright protection. TDM is the functional equivalent of human
researchers reading and analysing text and data - an activity that has never been an
infringement of copyright – through computer analysis. The results of TDM are new results,
which are not reproductions of the work.
This is consistent with the notion that copyright protection only covers ‘expression’ and not
ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts78. A monopoly on
information or ideas would be extremely burdensome on society as a whole, as well as being
contrary to international law.
What is surprising is that this seems to have been challenged with suggestions that these
activities should require a licence (beyond lawful access to content). If this were the case,
there would be a significant problem. In addition, the ubiquitous reproduction right might
also eventually put text and data mining activities under strain, and lead to reliance on the
exception for transient reproductions.


According to the McKinsey Global Institute's (MGI) report on data driven innovation, The
next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity (2011), data mining can generate
significant economic benefits, including enhancements in productivity and competitiveness, as
well as generating additional value for consumers. Text and data-mining is accordingly an
integral part of innovation and economic policies.
Data mining is strategically important for competitiveness, research and innovation:

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

The problem lies more in the problematic assertion that text and data mining might infringe
copyright. It is important to establish clearly and unambiguously that TDM is not currently in
general subject to copyright protection, and should not be. In particular, facts, ideas, cannot
be protected by copyright, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. Mining is a
non-expressive use that presents no legally cognizable conflict with the statutory rights or
interests of the copyright holders.

We would caution against any extension of the scope of copyright in this respect. Should there
be further discussions on this topic, we would also caution against drawing a distinction
between commercial and non-commercial TDM.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and




                                                                                            37
blogs79. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions80.

Users of online services regularly see content taken down, blocked, or in some cases
monetized for the benefit of the wrong person. While some services operate rights
management tools to assist in identifying re-used content, these cannot fulfil the role of
determining whether a particular use qualifies under an existing exception. This can result in
the blocking of content which is lawful and falls under existing copyright exceptions. Some




79
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

cases are not always clear: see Lenz v Universal81 (video), or YouTomb, an MIT research
project which collects videos wrongly removed from YouTube.
This can also result in the wrongful attribution of ‘ownership’ in the remix. For example, a
‘remix’ which qualifies as a creative work and which falls under the parody exception might
be treated by a system a being a reuse requiring permission for the owner of the parodied
content. Systems cannot determine whether a re-use is a parody. As a result, when the owner
of the parodied content chooses to authorise re-use against remuneration, remuneration
generated from the parody will be wrongly attributed to the owner of the parodied content.
The recent ‘Lescure report’ (Rapport de la Mission « Acte II de l’exception culturelle » :
Contribution aux politiques culturelles à l’ère numérique (May 2013), p. 425 et. seq.) in

create content.

While licensing is an important aspect of UGC, it has limitations. In addition to those pointed out
above, it only caters for major online services - users cannot share content on their own sites for
instance – and it may not be immediately available to new and innovative services.

Exceptions and limitations thus play a useful role in clarifying what users are permitted to do. It is
worth mentioning they are also necessary where refusing a permission for certain uses might be
economically rational, even despite the prospect of remuneration. This is for instance the case for
parodies and criticism of particular work.

It is debatable whether such limitations have a negative impact on the market for the work. A study for
the UK IPO on UGC on YouTube found that there was no evidence for economic damage to
rightholders through substitution, and that presence of parody content is correlated with, and predicts
larger audiences for original music videos82. The French Lescure Report notes that user generated
parodies and remixes contribute largely to the success of original content83.

Possible solutions include an express limitation for non-commercial ‘remixes’ as introduced in
Canada84; clarifying the scope of existing exceptions and encouraging Member States to implement
them, as suggested by the ‘Mission Lescure’ in relation to the exception for quotations85; or the
introduction of more flexible exceptions transformative uses.

63.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The scale of UGC is dramatic in terms of engagement and participation. Across 9 EU
countries in 2013 (France, Germany, Italy, UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden), BCG finds
that about eight in ten Europeans consumed UGC or participated in a social network during
the past 12 months; about three in ten uploaded a video or personal picture online; and nearly
two in ten were editing or managing a blog or website86. In the EU-28, according to Eurostat,
close to 23 million Europeans engaged in creating a website or blog in 2012, including 14%
of EU citizens aged between 16 and 24 years old. Over 83 million Europeans uploaded self-
created content to a website, including 47% of 16 to 24 year olds. 11% of Europeans posted
opinions on civic or political issues via websites. As for remixes, the Pew Research Center
reports that, in the US, 40% of adults who post videos to online sites post “videos that mix
content and material in a creative way”: In 2010, among Internet users, 21% of teens and 15%
of adults reported creating “remixes87.
The production of UGC content shows vitality and diversity: WordPress users produce about
36.3 million new posts and 63.1 million new comments each month. 130 hours of video are
uploaded to YouTube every minute. There are more than 77,000 active contributors to
Wikipedia working on more than 22,000,000 articles in 285 languages; there are 41 000 posts
a second on Facebook, 5,700 Tweets a second on Twitter; 758 million photos a day were
uploaded and shared online in 201388.
The value of UGC is also already clear. According to the OECD, UGC “provides citizens,
consumers and students with information and knowledge. Educational UCC content tends to
be collaborative and encourage sharing and joint production of information, ideas, opinions
and knowledge, for example building on participative web technologies to improve the quality
and extend the reach of education”; it is .an “open platform enriching political and societal
debates, diversity of opinion, free flow of information and freedom of expression [...]”89.
UGC also allows citizens to ‘talk back to culture’. Remixers are fans who engage with
culture, not pirates. Finally, “remixes produce valuable cultural and political commentary.
They are particularly attractive to groups underrepresented in [...] mass culture—women, non-
whites, and LGBT individuals, among others—who use remix to talk back to that culture, to
identify what it’s leaving out and explain what they see” 90(Organisation for transformative
works). It is also worth noting that ‘re-mixing’ is a seasoned practice for aspiring greats to
hone their talents - from Shakespeare, Milton, La Fontaine (i.e. Aesop) to Dali (i.e. Da Vinci),
Proust (i.e. Flaubert) and rap, creators engage with previous creations, re-use them, learn
skills.
We believe that UGC demonstrates that copyright rules that were designed with content
created ‘professionally’ in mind should take into account what is now the way people
experience creativity everyday. The overwhelming majority of content created today is no
longer produced by legacy copyright industries with legacy distribution models in mind.

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying91. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees9293.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions94 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain

     NO – Please explain
Levies should not be extended to the digital environment. EU copyright policy goal should be
for levies to be phased out.
Any initiative in relation to levies should clarify the scope of the levy, for instance in relation
to professional uses, legitimate consumer expectations, temporary copies, User Generated
Content – the two last examples being particularly relevant to the digital environment. UGC
clearly demonstrates that digital technology is overwhelmingly used to create and share
content produced by users, and not content administered by established rightholders. For
instance, in the EU-28, according to Eurostat, close to 23 million Europeans engaged in
creating a website or blog in 2012, over 83 million Europeans uploaded self-created content to
a website, including 47% of 16 to 24 year olds95. The result is a staggering vitality in the

   Across 9 EU countries in 2013, BCG finds that about eight in ten Europeans consumed UGC or participated in
a social network during the past 12 months; about three in ten uploaded a video or personal picture online; and
nearly two in ten were editing or managing a blog or website.

                                                                                                            42

million new comments each month; 130 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every
minute; there are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on more than
22,000,000 articles in 285 languages; 758 million photos a day were uploaded and shared
online in 2013.
Further reform might consider the need for a flexible exception that creates a ‘safe harbour’
from compensation claims. The scope of any exception for private uses should be sufficiently
flexible and future proof to adapt to legitimate consumer expectations in the digital
environment and to digital innovation. Such innovation has proven repeatedly that it delivers
growth for the creative industries and increased consumer welfare96. Platform or format
shifting (i.e. copying the same piece of legal content onto another device of the person) are
examples of new uses of the private copying exception that consumers legitimately expect:
these are happening as a matter of course, and that most reasonable people assume they are, or
should be, permissible. On the other hand, the exception should fit within the three-steps-test
so as to not unreasonably prejudice the interests of rightholders, without the need for
additional compensation.
The limit or boundary of the prescribed exception should preferably be purposive: contingent
on causing no unreasonable prejudice to rightholders.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?97

Users commonly assume that when they use an online content service that they should be able
to access their legally acquired content it various formats and across multiple devices. This is
simply the nature today’s digital environment, as noted by Mr Vitorino’s in his Report98, the
Irish Modernising Copyright report99 and the UK Hargreaves Review100.

private copying and reprography levies

   António Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the Mediation on Private Copying and Reprography Levies,
page 6: “A person paying for e.g. the download of a song expects that this payment does not only cover the first
download of that song onto his or her personal computer but also the subsequent copying of that song to a certain
number of his or her mobile devices, as determined by the usage rules of the service provider. Similarly, a person
subscribing to a music streaming service is usually not only paying for the online streaming to his or her device/s
but also for the possibility to create "playlists" that can be listened to when ‘offline’”
99
    Modernising Copyright: The Report of the Copyright Review Committee (Dublin, 2013), page 60,
http://www.enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/CRC-Report.pdf: the main argument in favour of private copying
exceptions relates to users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations. Users now commonly assume and
expect that, if they buy content for personal (as opposed to commercial) use, they should be able to access it in

                                                                                                               43
Accordingly, consumers purchase originals under the assumption that they can make copies,
and rightholders know these copies will occur. The ability to make copies is priced into
distribution to the consumer101. Put simply, consumers cannot reasonably be expected to
purchase separate originals for their home audio system, their car, their MP3 player and their
computer.
There is no demonstrable harm to rightholders in such cases, and these situations should be
considered de minimis. Mr. Vitorino came to the same conclusion in his report on copyright
levies where he rightly argued that applying a levy on an online service would pave the way
for multiple payments and be incomprehensible to consumers as it would be inconsistent
users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations.



66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
At a time when consumers seek to enjoy access anytime, anywhere, as well as produce their
own content, the notion that certain private acts of ‘copying’ trigger a levy is obsolete. The
issues listed below are only a non-exhaustive overview of the negative impact that extending
levies would generate.
Deterring investments in new online services and slowing revenue growth for creative
industries: Today, creative industries partner with digital services to develop new, attractive
online offerings of creative content to consumers. Such services require significant
investment, risk taking and commercial discussions. Should levies be allowed to develop for
digital content, it is worth noting this would be a clear deterrent to commercial licensing and
the development of new services. Indeed it seems the logic of such a system would be that,
the more licensors and service providers jointly work to develop new online services, increase
revenues and reduce piracy, the more levies would be claimed. It would also hamper the

various formats and across multiple devices. As a consequence, many users routinely make copies for private
use, and do not believe that this is or should be against the law”.

http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf: “digital technology has enabled use and reuse of material by
private individuals in ways that they do not feel are wrong – such as sharing music tracks with immediate family
members, or transferring a track from a CD to play in the car”
101
      “Economic theory suggests that the benefits consumers derive from any copyright exceptions will be
incorporated automatically into the demand for the original creative work. Consumers will recognise that buying
the original entitles them to use the product in various ways and hence their demand decision will reflect this”:
Mark Rogers, Joshua Tomalin and Ray Corrigan, ‘The economic impact of consumer copyright exceptions: A
literature review’ (2013), page 30; Ian Hargreaves, Digital Opportunity, ‘A Review of IP and Growth’, section 5.30:
“As right holders are well aware of consumers’ behaviour in this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able
to do this is already factored into the price that right holders are charging. A limited private copying exception
which corresponds to the expectations of buyers and sellers of copyright content, and is therefore already priced
into the purchase, will by definition not entail a loss for right holders”; Martin Kretschmer, ‘Private Copying and
Fair Compensation’ (2011) page 68: “a certain amount of copying can already be priced into the retail sale of the
first copy if the consumer understands these benefits”; Hal Varian (2005), ‘Copying and Copyright’, Journal of
Economic Perspectives 19(2): 121-138; p. 129; ‘Modernising Copyright: The Report of the Copyright Review

growth of such services due to various levy claims applied indiscriminately in different
services.
It is worth noting that this would lead to lost revenues for rightholders too. As noted by the
OECD, Cloud offerings bring consumers more value to consumers and broader audiences.
Rightholders benefit from this increased value through licensing as well as the opportunity to
distribute directly to consumers, with reduced distribution costs102.
Hampering economic growth and innovation: Cloud computing is expected to create 400
000 new small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union, to add nearly
1000 billion euros to EU GDP between 2015-2020 (contributing 1% to 4% to growth), and to
create of up to a million jobs in the EU103. For businesses, cloud services generate
considerable savings and productivity gains. For consumers, cloud services deliver a host of
useful day to day applications deliver over the cloud, as well as new opportunities to share
and store personal content, and new ways to consume creative content anytime, anywhere.
These include email, calendars, word processing and other productivity and collaborative
tools; photo sharing and editing tools, online games, cloud lockers, etc.
It has already been noted that levies have adverse consequences on growth.104 Levies have
significant adverse impact on the development of the economy and the digital economy in
particular.105 Innovation and opportunity costs are by definition difficult to predict, but there
is a growing body of evidence correlating copyright and innovation policy106. Harvard
professor Josh Lerner recently evaluated that legal uncertainty on cloud services lead to a
reduction in VC investment in the cloud of $4.6m and $2.8m respectively per quarter in
France and Germany107. In the UK, the government estimates that reforming copyright,
including a reform of private copying, will be “adding between 0.3% and 0.6% to the size of
the UK economy by 2020 – between £5 billion and £8 billion [€5.72 billion and €9.15 billion]
– and cutting deadweight costs in the economy by over £750 million [€858 million]”108. In
relation to levies, the UK IPO estimates that economic benefits to GBP 258.67 million109.
Segmenting the single market: It is also clear that levies are not efficient, imply a significant
administrative burden and the fragmentation of markets along national borders. Any European
company seeking to innovate in the area of cloud services would be stifled by the cost and
burden of liability for levy payments, in particular in relation to its non-EU counterparts. The
cloud and Internet services are global. Levies are applied by national collecting societies on a
strictly territorial basis and are triggered when a good crosses a border. Each time this occurs,
levies add up, bringing multiple payments, administrative costs and associated procedures.

This is fundamentally at odds with the vision of the EU single market and the global nature of
cloud services. Charging levies, i.e. a duty charged to consumers, on cloud services will
undermine the digital single market in cloud services before its opportunities have even
materialized. Yet a single market in digital services is key to driving cloud services forward in
the EU. Only a digital single market can attract investment in early stage offerings from EU
innovators.
Ignoring legitimate consumer expectations, increasing consumer prices, and taxing user
creativity: consumers legitimately expect that they can make private copies of content that
they acquire. Imposing new payments for their use of cloud type services would ignore their
expectations, penalise them for acquiring lawful content, and directly increase the costs of
accessing cloud services for consumers, so putting European consumers at a disadvantage
compared with their peers across the rest of the world.
Furthermore, imposing rules devised for an age of analogue devices, physical media, and
content exclusively produced for commercial distribution ignores the fact that the vast
majority of content in the cloud is professional or created by users, i.e. user-generated content
(UGC). Content such as emails, work documents or holiday photographs belongs to users and
does not need to be licensed or paid for. It is not content produced with a view to
commercially asserting copyright.
The notion that digital services and technologies are dependent on professional content for
consumer utility can no longer be substantiated. The overwhelming majority of content
produced and shared on the internet, on digital services and using connected devices does not
belong to rightholders organisations. These activities are clearly excluded from the scope of
private copying levies. Yet the bluntness of levies would catch all this content, and mandate
intrusive and highly misguided levies on personal content to the detriment of nearly all
citizens.
We believe the best way to generate more revenues for creators, enhance consumer welfare
and encourage growth is to encourage the development innovation and legal offers in Europe,
not more levies. The digital economy is a major driver for growth in the EU, and is expected
to grow seven times faster than overall EU GDP in coming years110. By 2016 the Internet
economy of the G-20 is predicted to reach an aggregate value of $4.2 trillion111. We therefore
fully support the orientation given by the Commission at the initiative of President Barroso:
“Exploiting the full potential of the digital economy is vital to delivering growth in Europe. It
is extremely important for us to work with industry in order to accelerate solutions which tap
the potential of digital markets to develop new business models. A modern copyright
framework can be win-win for all stakeholders, providing sustainable incentives for creativity,
cultural diversity and innovation, and improving choice and access to legal offers for
consumers112". Several governments such as the UK and Ireland have rejected levies, which
they characterise as a blunt instrument and a burden on innovation. We emphasise that levies
in relation to online service would significantly undermine the potential for growth of the
digital economy, and in particular European competitiveness and innovation.

Consumers generally do not know they are paying a private copy levy on digital equipment
they purchase, nor how much it is, or what it is for - or that the amount they pay varies

visible to consumers. This is already the case e.g. in France114.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments115.

undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
We would also like to highlight some problematic aspects of levies which deserve more
attention.
1. The current levy system in Europe is applied in an arbitrary manner, divorced from any
substantiated economic data and as a result difficult to square predictability and the rule of
law. This is clearly illustrated by massive divergence of tariffs across Europe and the
significant increase in claims. For example the difference in tariff on a single device across
the EU can vary anywhere between 1% - 10% of the purchase price, as documented by
WIPO’s International survey on private copying116. Across the single market, levies collected
per capita vary immensely are for instance over one hundred times higher in France than in
Romania117. A recent attempt in Italy envisaged a tariff increase of up 500% on a single
product. Similarly, in France, in 2008, the Conseil d’Etat invalidated the tariffs set by the
private copy commission for including illegal materials in calculation of the levy118. But
subsequently, the private copy commission set exactly the same tariffs as the one canceled by
the Council of States, arguing opportunistically that compression rates has changed, justifying
an increase.
Even allowing for some differences between consumer behaviours in different Member
States, it seems difficult to reconcile these examples with a legally and economically sound
application of levies. Indeed academic literature on levies acknowledges this arbitrariness, as
expressed by Prof. Towse : ”the copyright levy […] has been almost universally opposed by
economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to the
market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators”119.

about the economics of copyright” Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues, 2011, vol. 8(2),
pp.101-120. Similarly, “In our investigations into the levy systems in other countries, we contacted
experts in intellectual property law including Rufus Pollock (UK), Kimberlee Weatherall (Australia) and
Jeremy de Beer (Canada). They were able to provide us some useful information into the levy regimes

                                                                                                    48
Following the argument of Mr. Vitorino and confirmed by the ECJ Padawan ruling, the
determination of harm must been looked at “measuring all the copies actually made by virtue
of the exception without taking into account the consumers' willingness to pay for these
copies” will result in higher compensation than what the law requires. Which is currently the
case. UK and Ireland have shown that without the exception, rights- holders have not been not
experienced any economic harm. On the contrary, the UK market is one the most developed
markets of content in the world.
2. We would like to highlight an aspect of levies which is often overlooked. The differing
approaches to the issue cannot be fully understood without an understanding of how revenues
are collected, administered and distributed. For instance, licensing revenue for online rights
often flows through a commercial licensor such as a record company or a publisher, which is
not a collecting society. On the other hand, private copying levies are invariably collected and
administered by a collecting society. Such collecting societies in turn apply their internal
distribution rules and, where applicable, cultural and social deductions.
Against this backdrop, the growth of digital revenue generates tensions between the different
actors in the creative sector as to whom collects, manages and administers these new revenue
streams. This may lead rightholders to claim that revenues generated are insufficient, when in
reality the question is how this new revenue is collected and distributed, and by whom. For
instance, it is often alleged that artist revenues would collapse but for levies. But in practice,
collectively managed income is not the only source of income for creators, other sources
including e.g. contractual revenues.
It is not for us to comment on those issues. However, we merely point out that digital players
who work and partner with many rightholders to increase the growth of digital revenue are at
the same time caught up in discussions which in reality concern the creative sector. We
believe informed and evidence-based policy making is essential to a constructive discussion
on private copying levies. A useful first step would be to collect hard evidence on the claims
that creators are not benefiting from revenues.
3. As noted above, the collection of levies by collecting societies also contributes to culture
funds. These are worthy endeavours and again, it is not for us to comment on those issues in
so far as they pertain to cultural policy. However, the entities that grant licences, collect and
administer private copying levies and administer cultural funds are in practice often the one
and same, leading to unforeseen and perhaps undesirable consequences. For instance, income
for which no rightholder has been identified might be allocated to culture funds; or a society
may prefer collecting levies to granting a licence; or the amount of levies requested might be
in part determined by other factors than the existence of any proven harm to rightholders.
4. We believe the best way for copyright policy to promote cultural diversity is to allow
digital services to flourish and creators to be rewarded through the exercise of their
property rights. The problem is that the blunt application of levies clearly threatens to
undermine the digital growth of the creative sector: efforts to develop new, attractive legal
offers are met with calls for the payment of more compensation. This acts as a simple,
effective deterrent to the development of new services in the EU.



in their countries, but also confirmed our belief that levies worldwide are set mostly without any
reference to economic analysis of harm or damage”, Mark Rogers, Joshua Tomalin and Ray Corrigan,

We stress the benefits that online offerings are yielding for cultural diversity. A broader
diversity of creative content is being produced in Europe than ever before. The number of
books published in Europe has grown by close to 80% between 1995 and 2011.120 The annual
release of new music albums has increased significantly since 2000, the share of
independently produced records has grown and the number of artists achieving commercial
success has also increased.121 Between 2005 and 2009, the number of films produced in a year
in Europe rose from 890 to just under 1150.122 Revenues are also growing. From 2001 to
2011, all growth in the creative sector was generated by digital (30bn Euros).123 In the music
sector, according to PwC (2012), global spending on digital music will surpass psychical
distribution in 2015, as is already the case for the UK, the US, Sweden and South Korea. 124
iTunes reached the milestone of 25 billion songs sold in 2012. Deezer has 30 million users,
including 4 million paying subscribers and Spotify over 24 million active users and 6 million
paying subscribers. Contrary to some views, the internet has not diminished the appetite for
paid content, and new online services are reducing piracy.125 Between 2001 and 2011,
consumer spending on creative content in Europe rose by 25%.126
The current levy system acts as a hindrance to the development of these opportunities.
Disadvantages. It hinders innovation, creators and EU citizens alike, and has become an
obstacle to the role of copyright in funding and supporting creators. Alternative and
transparent models must also be explored in terms of providing funding for national cultural
purposes.

      V.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers127 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract128. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

  VI.        Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE129 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text130. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose131. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure132. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
      YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
      NO – Please explain

      NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

of intellectual property rights.

131
    For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
132
    This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
