     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-

holders?
X YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain
    -   What should be remembered is that copyright actually gives solutions to a
        number of problems that would otherwise be left to law of contracts, which, as
        can be seen in relation to sports rights, creates difficulties. Removing the
        possibility of territorially restricting copyright licenses might not have the
        intended effect, but may instead lead to more complex contractual regulation
        which could limit the access to cultural content from other European countries.

        Instead, as a means to solve the cross-border problem, the European Union could
        work to enhance collective management of rights, and also create a legal
        foundation for cross-border services based on systems such as extended collective
        licensing or other collective licensing systems. In particular for audio and
        audiovisual works we would strongly recommend a system of compulsory

                                                                                            9
         collective licensing (for both filmcopyright and music and film neighbouring
         rights).

         As neighbouring rights cannot be satisfactorily be exercised by the vast majority
         of performers they do not receive a fair remuneration for the use of their
         performances. Therefore an urgent need for action at EU level is required. The
         EU legislator could guarantee the fair remuneration on behalf of performers for
         the making available on demand of their performances and other uses, with the
         introduction of a right to equitable remuneration if a performer’s rights are
         transferred/assigned to the producer. Such a right would be administered by
         performers’ collective management organisations and would not create an
         obstacle to the cross border availability of content.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                10
1.      The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


X NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

The CJEU has provided some clarification, which favours a country of
reception/targeting/accessing approach. This seems a fair approach. A review of the
acquis communautaire that would confirm this point of view will ensure total clearance
in all specific cases.

X NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
X YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
    Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              11
Authors and performer’s rights could be affected, since Member States have different
national laws or practices. When there is uncertainty where the act of making available
occurs, than right holders are not sure which law would be applicable and therefore
cannot determine the extent of their protection.
This uncertainty will also create a risk for the right holder to claim damages or
injunctions. Clarification of the scope would therefore lead to lower litigation risks and
costs, for both right holders and service providers/end users.




2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO

The application of more than one right is not a problem. Dealing with several rights
within an agreement on economic exploitation is common practice in licensing




3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'



25
     Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

                                                                                                          12
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
There are circumstances under which a hyperlink could constitute an act of
communication to the public. According to Dutch case law (with reference to CJEU
cases), the relevant factors to assess whether a hyperlink constitutes an act of
communication to the public are: an intervention, a (new) public, and the intention to
make a profit. In those specific circumstances the provision of a hyperlink should be
subject to the authorisation of the right holder.
Commercial parties such as Facebook who make substantial revenues based on
hyperlinks should remunerate authors and performers of the works concerned.


  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why
If these reproductions do not fall under the scope of the exception of Article 5(1) of the
Directive 2001/29/EC, they should require authorisation of the right holder. The
necessity for an authorisation will thus depend on i.a. the economic significance of the
reproduction, the purpose of the reproductions and/or the involved acts and actors in
the making of the reproductions. (see also answer 11)

      – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
         – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO OPINION

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content could conflict with the
normal exploitation of the initial work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
interests of the right holder, since digital content will keep its perfect quality after resale
and it would be unfeasible to prevent the reseller of not keeping and using a copy of a
work. Therefore the resale would lead to unfair competition.


27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              14
C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
X YES
For some categories of works this could help.
However, for visual works, compulsory registration would be a disaster, especially when
this also influences the copyright protection, as this registration will always be
incomplete.




16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]

It would lead to more efficiency, legal certainty and fairness. Rightholders could more
easily be identified; this could facilitate the licensing process for users as well as the
distribution of royalties to right holders (through their cmo’s). It could also prevent
works/performances from becoming orphan works.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]

It will be expensive to set up and control such a system. Current initiatives for the
registration of audiovisual works (f.e. ISAN) do not function properly due to high costs
and lack of incentive for all audiovisual producers/right holders to cooperate.


29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             15
18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]

Registration in some sectors (see 15) could be ordered by law and facilitated by the
government.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]

The EU could provide for:
- subsidies (under condition of free/open access/license of databases);
- a legal framework that prescribes registration;
- safeguards against abuse and erroneous information in such databases.



E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely

31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X YES (authors) – Please explain
Authors Rights: More use is made of older works in the digital environment then ever
before. Authors should at least during their lifetime have control over the use of their
works as the importance of image and a good name have also increased. Also their
works should be protected for a reasonable period after their death. Whether 70 years is
reasonable could be a matter of debate.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO (performers)– Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Neighbouring rights: The adoption of Directive 2011/77/EU on the extension of term of
protection is an important step towards a better recognition of the value of performing
artists’ work and creativity. However, the extension of 20 years for the protection of
phonograms should also apply to audio-visual works. The rationale behind the extension
of 20 years for phonograms is that performers who participate in the recording of a
phonogram in the beginning of their career, cannot reap their benefits of these
performances later in their lives, for example when they are retired. The EU legislator
did not at that time choose to extend the protection for audio-visual performances. The
Commission should as soon as possible make the Impact Assessment that was agreed on
in the Term of Protection Directive in 2011.




 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.




35
  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
36
  Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                             17
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Since Member States are free to choose which limitations/exceptions they choose to
implement and which not, the scope of protection differs from one Member State to
another. The fact that, for example, the private copy exception is not implemented in all
EU countries, leads to distortion of the market and circumvention of the private copy
levies. For the same reason, reprographic rights could be harmonised.


      – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
In particular a private copy exception connected with private copying levies should be
made mandatory. This system takes into account both the interests of the end user, who
is allowed to make private copies as well as the rights of authors and performers who
will receive a fair remuneration for the use of their works. In order for the market to
function properly, harmonisation should take place regarding the subjects of
determining rates/fees and regarding the enforcement of payment of levies.
      – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
For audio and audiovisual works we would recommend adding an exception for
filesharing by private individuals, comparable to the homecopying exception.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
       – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain why
Notwithstanding and apart from the answer to question 23 and 37 the existing list of
limitations and exceptions provide for sufficient flexibility for the member states. More
flexibility by adding limitations and exceptions and especially an open norm will lead to

                                                                                       19
more disadvantages for the rightholders. They will bear the burden to proof that certain
use is illegitimate and will receive less income for use allowed under a new exception or
limitation, if no fair remuneration system is installed.
Licensing, especially collective licensing, provides a more flexible solution to both users
and rights holders..




25.     If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Especially the criteria for fixing rates concerning private copy levies should be
harmonised, in order to create a level playing field for consumers, the industry and right
holders. The individual consumer, is the person responsible for paying the private
copying levy, in accordance with the rules of the relevant member state (as confirmed by
CJEU in C-462/09 (Opus).


A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts

                                                                                            20
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
X YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.


Often complete collections are digitalised. The preservation copy is and should only be
allowed if the only aim is to restore a piece, when the original copy is in danger of decay
or if the technique needed to consult the original copy becomes obsolete.
For digitalising works in the Netherlands rightholders (Pictoright en Lira) and heritage
institutions have come to an agreement that payment of remuneration is postponed until
such time when the digitalised collection is made available online. A problem however
arises because some heritage institutes do offer the possibilities of ordering copies to the
public, without clearing the rights.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
- For digitalising works in the Netherlands rightholders (Pictoright en Lira) and the
National Archive, as well as the National Library have reached separate agreements.

33.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
-Some of the institutions have digitalised complete collections of visual and news
archives, sometimes with the possibility to order works, without respecting the

                                                                                          22
copyrights of the authors. A system of extended collective licensing could provide a
solution.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
-Whatever solution, this could never harm the (financial) position of the rightholders.
Agreements about the use of the works could be concluded by the CMO’s, and that
reproduction is always subject to prior permission.

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
          – Please explain with specific examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
In most cases authors (or their CMO) do not have a position to negotiate this use of their
work with libraries. It is not completely clear whether E-lending is allowed under
current the lending exception. The position of authors should in no case be weakened.

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU

44
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             24
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
By means of extended collective licensing (ECL). The Law should contain provisions
giving an extended effect to the clauses in a collective agreement in specific areas of
copyright - or neighbouring rights field. Subsequently, CMO’s will be enabled to license
such works while representing all relevant right holders, unless right holders choose to
‘opt out’.
          – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
X YES – Please explain
An ECL system with opt-out possibility would be useful for all types of content. It
creates legal certainty for users and operators and it ensures that right holders get a fair
remuneration for the use of their works/performances.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
X       YES – Please explain
In the Netherlands, use for non-commercial teaching is allowed, provided that a fair
remuneration is paid. It’s getting harder to conclude agreements, especially since
schools and teachers are using more works in digital products.



    NO OPINION

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
- Use for teaching is growing because of the digital possibilities; certain, well specified
forms of use could be allowed by EU-law, if the rightholders have a non-transferable
right to a fair remuneration.
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
-In the Netherlands, collective agreements exist between CMO’s and teaching
institutions, but concluding new agreements is getting more and more difficult. Another
risk is that the remunerations go to the publishers instead of the authors.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
- Certain, well specified forms of use could be allowed by EU-law, if the rightholders
have a non-transferable right to a fair remuneration. The authors could be res-
presented by their CMO’s.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open

States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or

51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              28
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated




53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

X YES – Please explain by giving examples
In the fields of audio and audiovisual works: producers often demand from authors and
performers to transfer all their exclusive rights, generally in return for a one off lump
sum payment. As a result, performers are no longer able to consent to, or forbid, the use
of their performance, nor bargain on an equitable remuneration.
In general: one should be very careful to introduce a general exception for UGC, where
the definitions are still unclear, and to attach a condition such as commercial or non-
commercial use, as this is also a very arbitrary. UGC is not new, and so far, existing
regulations and agreements seem to be sufficiently apt, although parties such as
YouTube and FB don’t wish to comply in all cases and rightholder are missing out on
fair remunerations.

61.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

As for audio and audiovisual works, a legislative solution would be an unwaivable
remuneration right for the making available right of performers, in case this right is
transferred to the producer, which is subject to collective management. In this manner,
performers are ensured of a fair remuneration for the use of their performances
through on demand platforms as Youtube.
In general, for other works, caution is needed not to introduce a general exception, if
this weakens the (financial) position of the authors.

    IV.      Private copying and reprography

exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and

photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain

For acceptance of private copy levies it would help if the tariffs in all Member States
would uniformly be established. Furthermore, under the current EU framework,
authors and performers do not receive a fair remuneration for private copies made on
cloud based services. It would be helpful if the scope and application of the private copy
exception would be clarified in this regard.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
     YES – Please explain
All digital copies should be subject to the payment of private copying levies. The ability
of right holders to control and license acts of private copying continues to be unrealistic

and does not take into account that (authors and) performers have very little bargaining
power.
As determined in the VG Wort case (C-457/11) any act ‘authorising’ a private
reproduction, in case a private copy exception applies, has no legal effect and such
purported ‘authorisation’ would have no bearing on fair compensation owed.

In the context of digital copies and considering current consumer practices, one cannot
reasonably consider such acts of private copying as causing ‘minimal harm’. Private
copying levies should therefore be payable. We would like to stress that the payment of
fair compensation to right holders is an essential requirement for the legitimacy of the
implementation of private copying exceptions in national jurisdictions.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
Electronics manufacturers have often argued against private copying levies as having a
negative impact on the market. This argument is however difficult to understand since
this system of compensation clearly achieves its objectives. Consumers are able to copy
legally onto and between their different devices and right holders are remunerated for
such uses.
Moreover, those manufactures who have been opposing the system the most are those
who have most benefited as devices and media have been purchased because of their
capacity to record and store creative content.
Since the consumers are responsible for the payment of levies for private copy, there is
no reason to presume that levies would impact the development and functioning of new
business models. In fact: the alternative: the need to get individual licenses from all
rightholders concerned and prohibiting the use of services would stifle new business
models.
Levies would have a positive impact on the right holders, because they would finally be
remunerated for the private copy use on these online services.


67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60

         – Please explain


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This
results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At
the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of
private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member
States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could
remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
        – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

     X NO – Please explain
In the Netherlands private copy levies are collected by Stichting de Thuiskopie.
Stichting de Thuiskopie provides the opportunity to reclaimlevies paid for exported
carriers. Since the CJEU case C-462/09 (Opus) it is clarified who is responsible for
payment in cross border situations.




69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

The exact percentage is unknown. That depends of the type of carrier. In the Dutch
system for example 50% of the PCs and laptops is regarded as used for professional
purposes and for audio-video players this is 0%. On behalf of market research the
private copy behaviour of consumers on all types of carriers can be determined. When it
can be demonstrated, any payment of a business user could be recovered at Stichting de
Thuiskopie.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

Stichting de Thuiskopie has set up a system of a priori exemption and post
reimbursement of private copy levies. On the basis of agreements signed with importers
and manufacturers, it is possible for importers / manufacturers to deliver to business
users without payment of private copy levies. The objective is to exempt the total
business chain in advance, as much as possible. If manufacturers of 100% business
products can demonstrate that their products are not intended for consumer use and
does not end up on the consumer market, they will be completely exempted.

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
-

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Most authors and performers do not (fully) benefit from their intellectual property
rights in individual contracts, since many producers and publishers demand in general a
global and unlimited transfer of the exclusive rights of authors and performers for a
fixed and final fee. This fixed and final fee is insufficient and does not constitute an
equitable remuneration.

62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                            36
The best mechanism(s) would be:
1.       A strong contract law;
2.      An exception to competition law for the field of cultural production; allowing
collective negotiations on behalf of authors and performers;
3.      (Especially in the case of audiovisual works) A statutory right to fair
remuneration for each type of exploitation of the works, when their exclusive rights are
transferred to the producer. For reasons of efficiency and an equal bargaining position,
the collection of the remuneration should be subject to collective management. The
parties that make the works available to the public should be liable for such
remuneration, instead of the producer.
This would ensure authors and performers that they are remunerated for the
exploitation of their performances.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     X YES – Please explain
As mentioned in the previous question, there is an urgent need to revise the acquis by
introducing a guarantee ensuring that authors and performers receive an equitable
remuneration when they have transferred/assigned their exclusive rights to
producers/publishers/commissioners.

NO – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
Some general rules should be laid down within the EU to strengthen authors and
performers’ rights and to guarantee the efficiency of collective management, see answers
above. Especially the answers to questions 7, 20 (with regards to neighbouring rights),
22, 23, 36, 37, 40, 41 and 72.


     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

                                                                                                      37
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     X YES – Please explain
Business models that are based on copyright infringements hinder the development of
legal business models. EU legislation should therefore provide for effective remedies to
ensure that these remedies are available in each Member State to enable right holders to
effectively act against infringements on copyright with a commercial purpose.
        – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Under EU law injunctions against intermediaries are already possible, a framework
should be developed that provides for notice-and-take-down (NTD) procedures. This
reduces costs for right holders to act against infringements, without having to litigate to
prevent acts of copyright infringements.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
         – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           38
  X NO – Please explain
The right to have one’s copyright respected could be taken more into account, both by
creating easier access to licenses (for example through collective licensing) and by a
better framework for enforcement.. With i.a. NTD procedure this could be ensured,
while not prejudicing the right to privacy and protection of personal data.



   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


   NO
X NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
-In general the financial position of authors and performing artists based on their rights,
is weakening; producers/publishers/commissioners are demanding full transfer of
rights, without a fair remuneration. At the same time, citizens feel that everything is free
and that they don’t need to pay for use, reproduction or UGC. Author’s and performers
need to be protected against this.
