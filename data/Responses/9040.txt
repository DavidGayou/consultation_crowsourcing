II.         Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC2 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software3 and databases4.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders5 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies6, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks7. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of

  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
3
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

5
  Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
6
  The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in
any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of a
transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
7
  The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 3
a certain Member State's public8. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
A functioning digital market should ensure against further complexities by avoiding the splitting of
certain rights and, indeed, there is a risk associated with horizontal fragmentation where rights to the
same economic right are controlled by multiple parties. Two options would be to ensure that both
rights are licensed by the same licensor, or that only licensors offering both rights may offer multi-
territorial or pan-European licenses.

    III.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC9.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law10. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
8
  See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)11, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional12, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")13.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
     NO – Please explain
In the case of the private copy exception in particular, the mere fact that limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright Directives are optional for Member States has not in itself been the

11
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
12
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
13
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            5
source of significant problems and, as such, we do not believe there is a need to make the exception
mandatory. On the other hand, the fact that the scope of the private copy exception varies from
Member State to Member State is certainly problematic. For further detail, we refer to our response(s)
to section IV of the consultation below.

     NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying14. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees1516.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

the private copying and reprography exceptions17 in the digital environment?

   Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                          6
The following answer focuses on private copying within the meaning of Article 5.2(b) of Directive
2001/29 and does not address reprography

Much of the problem in Europe stems from the fact that there is no common understanding or
consistent approach to private copying. Private copying exceptions differ enormously from Member
State to Member State and some are more transparent than others. This is confusing for consumers
who have no idea what they can and cannot do legitimately. Indeed what a consumer may be legally
entitled to do in one Member State may be illegal in another member State, even using exactly the
same device.
Given this divergence, it could be beneficial to harmonise the maximum scope of private copy
exceptions in the EU in those countries which implement the exception so all Member State rules
would be consistent, tidying up the fragmentation we have today. This is not a call for all Member
States to have exactly the same private copy exceptions, but it is a call for the maximum scope of the
private copy exception to be defined at EU level. It would still be permissible for Member States to
have narrower (but not broader) private copy exceptions within their national laws.
As a matter of general principle the exception should, on the one hand, be drawn as broadly as
possible to embrace all those acts of private copying such as platform or format shifting (i.e. copying
the same piece of legal content onto another device of the person) which are happening as a matter of
course, and that most reasonable people believe already are, or should be, permissible. On the other
hand, it is imperative the exception remains narrow and sufficiently limited so that it causes no
significant harm to rightholders (and remaining compliant with the so-called 3-step test in Art. 5.5 of
Directive 2001/29). This is the critical balance that has to be struck, and which a harmonisation of the
maximum scope of the exception could potentially help to achieve.
The ‘limit’ or ‘boundary’’ of the prescribed exception should preferably be purposive rather than
quantitative - contingent on causing no significant proven harm to the rights holder, in the sense that
the permitted copy did not result in a lost sale. Provided there is genuinely no lost sale, the nature (and
impact) of private copying acts is, and should be considered, immaterial. The presumption should be
that not all private copies for personal use have the same economic value or result in a lost sale. This
would also provide an opportunity to clarify that certain private copying activities of legally acquired
content, such as platform or format shifting as well as time shifting, for personal use or within the
strict domestic family circle, cause no more than minimal harm to the rightholder and so are outside
the scope of levies meaning no compensation falls due.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?18
         – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
No - digital copies made for personal use, with no more than minimal harm to the rightsholder, and/or
made within the context of a service that has already been licensed by rightholders should not be
subject to private copying levies.
First of all, if the harm to the rightholder is at most minimal, there would seem to be no case in the
first place for the application of levies as set forth in the Directive 2001/29. Combined with the fact
that the copies are made in the context of a licensed service, where the harm is no more than minimal,

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                           7
potential application of a levy would create a situation, as highlighted by former Commissioner
Vitorino, in which consumers are effectively paying twice, or even multiple times, for the same
service.
It is worth noting that a regime in which service providers could legitimately license only one
reproduction (such as the first download) of a file for consumer consumption (on the basis that all
secondary copies would be excluded – i.e. unlicensed – as private copies) within a service where a
service provider seeks to offer more extensive usage rights to consumers and where other rights
holders are willing to license the entirety of such usage rights, would seriously detract from the whole
consumer value proposition in the digital content service area. This position is known to be held and
promoted by several collecting societies who seek to structure their licenses and licensing regime so as
not to prejudice their claims for copyright levies, because the revenue opportunities from private copy
levies are seen as more lucrative than licensing. This is seriously hindering effective content licensing
because consumers do not have transparency as to the overall eventual costs of specific services they
wish to subscribe to, and businesses throughout the value chain (including service providers targeted
to pay levies) are unable to assess their full costs if there is an impact from, or claim for, levies. As a
consequence, service providers may offer more limited services – or no services at all – resulting in
European consumers losing out, and discouraging market innovation and experimentation. The
consumer also loses out economically because, in such a scenario, consumers would pay a levy
repeatedly - potentially without limitation - for the same digital content on their different digital
devices (platforms) and blank media, on top of the license fee; a phenomenon known as “double or
multiple dipping” – which further boosts the potential levy revenue compared with license income.
For these reasons, and in order to ensure a “level digital playing field”, we would advocate that
licenses must cover and authorise all uses permitted within the full scope of the digital service
offering.




66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Copyright levies have a negative impact on new business models since levies are a kind of state
monopoly tax, not subject to market forces, and so tend to increase prices uncontrollably and thus limit
the attractiveness, competitiveness and development of business models based on new technologies.
Obsolete and analogue era-based levy systems hinder the establishment of a Digital Single Market
within the EU, and deter the EU from attracting and promoting digital innovation in today’s global
market, and as such, would only decelerate the development of promising and increasingly popular
new services such as those enabled via cloud computing.
Innovation and changing consumer expectations have brought significant, and overwhelmingly
positive, changes to the way content is created, distributed, and consumed. At a time when consumers
want to access their films and music anytime, anywhere and from any device through cloud services or
streaming platforms, the very notion of private copying is increasingly obsolete.
Moreover, private copy levies should never be contemplated as, or be allowed to develop into, a
primary or significant revenue source for digital content, as this would discourage legitimate and
innovative digital distribution models in Europe as well as disincentivise commercial licensing
activities, at a time when – despite the challenges of digital piracy – many service providers are
making substantial investments in developing and launching new digital offerings.
It would thus appear counter-productive and, in light of the problems experienced in the system for
device-based levies, incomprehensible to extend to emerging online services such an outdated,
dysfunctional, and irreparable system. Furthermore, one of the main advantages of cloud services is

                                                                                                         8
their inherent ubiquity; trying to impose territorial/national levy systems on such global services seems
unfeasible and absurd, especially considering the principles of the Single Market. Cloud computing
allows easier access to digital content for consumers and provides artists and creators with new
distribution models and revenue opportunities from licensing. Imposing levies on such new models
would only slow down their development, and risk re-producing the significant problems already
experienced by those in the devices sector(s).


67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?19
     YES – Please explain
Consumers generally do not know they are paying a private copy levy on digital equipment they
purchase, nor how much it is, or what it is for - or that the amount they pay varies significantly from
country to country. At the very least, the amount of the levy should be made visible to consumers at
the point of sale.

     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION


Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments20.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
Nokia is aware that cross-border transactions can result in undue levy payments, and the processes for
reclaiming undue levies, to the extent they exist, are grossly inefficient. In general, the need for
reporting to societies imposes a huge administrative burden, incurring additional cost and complexity,
both to manufacturers and importers, and not least because the type of detailed information needed to
be reported is not normally held by companies, and so has to be gathered and collated specially and
only for this purpose.

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
Given the various problems of the current device-based levies system – a legacy from a bygone
analogue age - completely new alternatives to this compensation model must be actively encouraged
and developed. The current system of device-based levies and payments is simply not functioning and
cannot be repaired.
Nokia believes that in order to ensure and encourage the proper functioning of the overall digital
copyright eco-system, it is not only vital, but also fairer and more efficient for rights holders to be
remunerated directly through licensing rather than be compensated by indirect remunerative schemes
such as private copy levies. With licensing, the returns to rights holders are readily correlated to the
consumers’ use of content, which is not at all the case with levies. Policy should focus primarily on
achieving a digital copyright environment conducive to efficient licensing where rights holders are
remunerated directly through licensing instead of indirect, inefficient and even arbitrary and nebulous
compensatory schemes such as private copy levies. The more digital content and uses of such content
that consumers (are able to) acquire as fully licensed at the outset the less need there is for levies
because rights holders are then directly and fairly compensated.
The fact that the revenues from levies have been, in some instances and depending on Member State
policies and interpretations of the law(s), diverted to purposes other than the direct compensation of
rightholders (such as the funding of cultural events and subsidies for the creative sectors, etc.), the
debate on reform, or the phasing out, of the levies system has of course become more complicated and
skewed. It is therefore important to separate developments in digital distribution from the important
work of subsidising cultural diversity and grass-roots funding of local cultural initiatives often done by
collecting societies. We support this important work; however, it is important that objectives relating
to such social programmes are done without burdening the copyright regime, which needs to be
commercially driven and market-based. Potential conflicts arise when the same organisations are
involved with commercial licensing and with subsidies to various non-commercial national cultural
programmes.
Europe is unique in having a rich and diverse cultural heritage, and this needs to be supported and
nurtured in the digital information age. Copyright is an important pillar of creativity and cultural
achievement in Europe, and it is also an important resource. However, Nokia believes that copyright
levies should not be used to help fund cultural activities. Going back to first principles, the purpose of
copyright levies is as recompense for any non-minimal harm from legitimate, private copying. Using
levies to subsidise broader cultural initiatives amounts to a back-door cultural tax, imposed arbitrarily
and indiscriminately on a segment of industry, without regard to the important role industry is
increasingly playing in supporting and promoting the content sector, not least through investments and
new services. The internet and mobile communication network are themselves important platforms for
fostering creativity and cultural initiatives.
Alternative and transparent models have to be found to provide funding for national cultural purposes,
and a preferred solution would be direct state funding out of general tax revenues, rather than shifting
