                   Contribution to the Commission’s public consultation
                           on the review of EU copyright rules

This contribution is submitted by VDFS.

VDFS is an Austrian Collecting Society in the field of audiovisual works and represents film-authors
(directors, cameramen, editors, stage- and costume designers) and performers (actors). At the
moment VDFS represents approx. 2.500 rightholders of audiovisual works. VDFS is operating in
Austria under the Austrian Copyright Act no 111 of 1936, as last amended by law no 150 of 2013, by
the Austrian Copyright Collecting Societies Act no 9 of 2006, as last amended by law no 190 of 2013,
and under the license to operate dated 30.6.2008.

Firstly we would like to point out, that the deadline for answering to this contribution was indeed
very short, but nevertheless VDFS tried to answer to most of the questions of the contribution below.

Secondly we hope the Commission will judge the submitted answers mainly by quality and not by
quantity, as consumers and users will always achieve more of a numerous majority than rightholders.
Minorities need special protection, not only but especially in the fields of (European) copyright law.

Of course “Copyright Management Organisations” (CMOs) also represent large numbers of various
rightholders, not only on a national level, but worldwide based on reciprocal agreements concluded
with foreign sister societies. This fact surely has also to be considered, when taking into account the
“quantity” of the submitted contributions to the consultation.

We also notice a certain kind of copyright-unfriendly-tendency in the posed questions of the
contribution, and wonder what might be the reason for that, as the Commission should deal with
these very important issues and fundamental questions about possible adaptations of the European
copyright rules in a most neutral and unprepossessed way.

Finally VDFS welcomes the various judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of the past and
present in the area of European Copyright Law, which give sufficient guidelines for the interpretation
of the Info-Soc Directive as well as for other EU-Directives. We therefore severely criticise the
possible consideration of the European legislator - as indicated in many of the questions of the
contribution - to “overrule” the jurisdiction of the court, which in some cases might be against the
interests of some (economically potential and therefore influential) stakeholders.

Yours sincerely,

    I.      RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET


A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?


3. How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of
requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
concerned.



VDFS is a collecting society in the audiovisual field that collectively administers remuneration rights
(e.g. private copying remuneration, public lending right, use for educational purposes) and secondary
rights of exploitation, such as the “cable retransmission right”. We therefore legally must not and
practically do not “grant licences”, be it on a national or a multi-territorial level, as primary
exploitation rights are transferred by our members to the producers. So there is practically no
request for multi-territorial licences at all.
Authors generally have “exclusive rights” without borders, so they can licence the exploitation of the
work without borders as well. But in the EU’s audiovisual sector authors usually assign their rights for
the whole world to the producer. Their works are exploited globally by the producer who can license
the exploitation rights for various modes of exploitation and territories. Audiovisual authors are
neither able to control the distribution of their works, nor the remuneration for the exploitation of
their works. The European film and audiovisual sector are fragmented into several markets based on
languages and types of exploitation of the works. Most audiovisual (online) media services, target
specific markets. These services do not need and therefore do not request multi-territorial licences.
Because there is no harmonization of collective rights management in the audiovisual sector, in
particular for authors’ rights, only a few audiovisual authors’ CMOs (e.g. in Belgium, France, Italy,
Spain and Switzerland) are able to clear online rights for their repertoire. In other countries, such as
Austria, online rights for audiovisual works are individually managed (by the producers).
Of course audiovisual authors want their works to be widely accessible on online services. They are
interested in developing a model for the collection and distribution of audiovisual authors’
remuneration for the online exploitation of their works. One major obstacle is that only a few
audiovisual authors’ CMOs are entitled to clear the online rights for their repertoire. This reduces the
interest of service providers for such a multi-territorial licence. This lack of harmonisation is an
obstacle to pan-European online rights clearance for European audiovisual works. The Commission is
also unclear about the cooperation possibilities between CMOs and generally prefers to encourage
competition. There is also no harmonisation of the tax treatment of cross-border royalty payments
between Member States. If CMOs from different Member States develop a common licensing
platform, they expose their members to an additional layer of withholding tax. These problems
should be urgently solved by the Commission.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the best way
to tackle them?


VDFS is of the opinion that the existing European Copyright Directives don’t prevent the operability
of cross-border services within the EU. Collective management, i.e. the transfer of rights to CMOs, is
the best way to ensure remuneration for rightholders and to enable cross-border activities for
content service providers.
The European legislator should provide audiovisual authors with a harmonised guarantee of
remuneration for the online exploitation of their works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This



                                                     2
should be implemented by an unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration enforced through a
scheme where CMOs are entrusted to collect the remuneration at the level of the final distributors.
In the audiovisual sector, after the initial transfer of the authors’ making available right to the
producer, this right is usually split territorially and transferred to many different operators. The
contractual chain back to authors is very long and easily broken if one element of the chain
experience difficulties (e.g. an intermediary going out of business) so that the authors rarely receive
any remuneration based on the exploitation of the work. Collective management should therefore
guarantee actual remuneration for the online exploitation of audiovisual works for the authors, and
be helpful to users who know where to get the licences from.


5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?


YES - Please explain
VDFS wants to point out that “territorial restrictions” are more often a “cultural” than a “legal”
problem. If you e.g. think about traditional dialect singers and musicians, one can hardly imagine a
common internal market because of cultural and/or linguistic differences and interests within the
various groups of consumers. Of course audiovisual authors want their works to be accessible all over
Europe as long as all required authorisations have been regularly acquired from the producers. In
fact there is no distributor in Europe that is able to exploit audiovisual works in all countries for all
modes of exploitation. Even audiovisual media services, who could technically exploit audiovisual
works on a worldwide basis, target specific markets and actively promote their catalogue only in a
limited number of languages. Therefore one can doubt the actual need of these services to acquire
pan-European rights if they do not exercise them. Of course licences should match the exploitation
prospects. In addition, VDFS is in favour of an obligation of exploitation of the rights held (“use it or
lose it”) so that distributors are incentivised to actively promote the audiovisual works they have
acquired. Finally we again want to underline that collective management is the most efficient way to
ensure the widest possible availability of widest possible repertoires in a very comfortable way.


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are
needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

NO - Please explain
VDFS is of the opinion that there is no need for legislative changes to increase the cross-border
availability of content services in the internal market, as the current legal copyright framework is no
obstacle to achieve that goal. The Commission should consider legal initiatives to ensure a system of
higher protection for rightholders and fair remuneration for the usage of their works. Also the
liability provisions of the E-Commerce Directive for Internet providers should possibly be revised by
the Commission.
Beyond that, the European legislator should ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the
online distribution of their works, independently of the country of production and exploitation. With
such a level playing field, authors’ collective management organisations, entrusted to manage the
making available remuneration of audiovisual authors could develop “one-stop-shops” to offer a
single licence point to online operators. This will, in turn, make it easier for them to pay the
remuneration due to the European audiovisual authors of the works in their catalogue. This must be
a priority for the Commission to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the on-demand
exploitation of their works whatever the country of exploitation.
In addition, an obligation of exploitation of the rights held (“use it or lose it”) would – as mentioned
before - be a strong incentive for these operators to make the works available. If there has been no


                                                         3
exploitation of a work for a period of time, then the authors’ rights revert back to them and they can
exploit their rights themselves. This would also help unlock cultural heritage works.

Finally, a reduced VAT rate for on-demand audiovisual works is a necessity for the development and
take-up of online services: only cinema tickets and broadcasting currently benefit from a reduced
VAT rate so far. When delivering the same audiovisual works on VOD and catch-up TV (and on DVD),
audiovisual media services cannot apply a consistent reduced VAT rate. It is essential to allow
Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate for all audiovisual works independently of their delivery
method and in particular in the online environment. Such a reduced rate would boost the online
market twofold: by competing on price with physical products and by drawing consumers away from
illegal services.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in
   digital transmissions?

1. The act of “making available”


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is disseminated
across borders – sufficiently clear?

YES
According to our point of view the scope of the “making available right” is sufficiently clear.
VDFS would like to clarify, that issues relating to private international law should also be solved by
private international law rules. The Info-Soc-Directive is not the right source in this respect. However,
the making available right itself should be clarified by introducing an “unwaivable right of authors to
remuneration” for their making available right, even if the exclusive right has been transferred to the
producer, so that authors are guaranteed a financial reward proportional to the real exploitation of
their works.
Furthermore, on whether to apply the “country of origin principle” as applied to satellite
broadcasting to online audiovisual media services, VDFS notes that the 2001 InfoSoc-Directive did
not transpose the “exhaustion principle” applicable to satellite broadcasting to the making available
right. Article 3 of the Directive expressly provides authors with an exclusive right. We are therefore
not in favour of the exhaustion of the making available right. It would deprive authors from an
essential element of their exclusive right. What was acceptable for satellite broadcasting, due to its
limited impact, in 1993 and still today, would override basic principles of copyright protection when
it comes to online transmissions as they already are, and will continue to be, an increasingly
important mode of transmission of works. The country of origin approach is not appropriate as it
does not resolve any of the problems identified by the Commission and would only lead to “forum
shopping” to find the most favourable regimes.
Online audiovisual media services should work more with rightholders at the origin of the production
and distribution of works in order to secure online exploitation rights for cross-border services.


9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief)?

NO
Again VDFS thinks that there is no actual problem with the “territorial scope” of the making available
right. As indicated above private international law related issues should not be solved by “abusing”
the Info-Soc Directive. We do not think that a clarification of the territorial scope would have any
impact on the recognition of the authors’ rights, the possible transfer of rights and their


                                                      4
remuneration. These issues are mainly dealt with in legislation and authors’ contracts. The only way
to address the current problems related to these issues is to tackle them directly through
harmonisation and not through the territorial scope of the making available right.


2. Two rights involved in a single exploitation


     10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment
     (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

NO
The “reproduction right” and the “making available right” are two different exclusive rights provided
by international, European and national copyright laws and their separate application has never
created any problems from a practical point of view. Usually rightholders cooperate with each other
to provide services with the relevant rights. Above that in the audiovisual sector both rights are
usually managed by the same entities.

3. Linking and browsing

     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
     copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
     rightholder?

YES – under certain circumstances

First it is important to note that VDFS surely does not want to prevent the normal utilisation of the
Internet, which is based on a wide array of hyperlinks. But of course it has to be considered, that
there are many (technically) different ways of linking. A normal hyperlink (i.e. a mere digital
reference to content which can be found elsewhere on the internet) has to be treated differently
than e.g. a deep, framed or embedded link. A hyperlink as such of course should not need the
authorisation of the rightholder, but for “embedded” or “framed” links within websites,
authorisation is needed, especially if the linking generates commercial gain. “Deep-linking” on the
other hand might be considered as an act of “communication to the public” in the sense of the Info-
Soc Directive.

VDFS wants to point out, that the Commission should respect and take into account the various
decisions and pending cases of the CJEU regarding these questions.

     12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other
     subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer,
     either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO – Please explain

VDFS thinks that the act of “simple viewing” should never need the authorisation of the rightholder,
independently from the medium or technology that provides for the content or enables its viewing.
“Temporary reproductions” are covered under a mandatory copyright exception of the Info-Soc
Directive (Art 5/1). However, when the reproduction comes from an obviously illegal platform, the
temporary reproduction - but not the viewing itself - should be prohibited (as per the ruling in the
kino.to case in Germany where the notorious German streaming portal site offering links to illegal
films and TV series was shut down and the people behind the portal prosecuted).




                                                      5
4. Download to own digital content


14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


According to VDFS’ humble opinion the “exhaustion principle” should not be applied to the “making
available right” of the Info-Soc Directive. This right is part of the “communication to the public” and
does not exhaust, as previously confirmed by the CJEU. The “Used Soft” decision by the CJEU was
limited to the Software Directive for that specific case and so its application cannot be extended to
the Info-Soc Directive. The recitals of the Info-Soc Directive themselves state that exhaustion is not
relevant in the case of making available online.

Re-sale of protected works such as audiovisual works online would result in new copies, and as far as
“forward and delete” technology (which erases the first copy from the seller’s hard drive) isn’t
applied, which still is the regular case, each reproduction has to be authorised by the rightholders.
Providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would
actually raise more problems than it solves. However, a number of issues would have to be carefully
considered. For example, whether rightholders would be ensured a fair proportion from the
proceeds from re-sales, whether it would be feasible to obtain rightholders’ authorisation for each
act of resale, whether the first sale doctrine should apply in the digital context to content other than
software, the meaning of a “copy” for copyright purposes (i.e. if the new copy made on the reseller
platform amounts to an infringement of the reproduction right), etc.

As indicated before, exhaustion is and should be limited to “physical goods”. The exhaustion of rights
concerning “digital distribution” is not the right way to handle the resale of digital files such as films
or other audiovisual works, as digital distribution varies from physical distribution in many significant
ways.

C. Registration of works


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of
works and other subject matter?

NO

VDFS wants to point out, that CMOs already provide such a “registration system” for the
identification and licensing of works in various ways. They already administer lots of information
about rightholders, their works and the usage of works on a national, European and international
level and grant relating licenses (which is basically true for musical societies, as in fact most of the
audiovisual societies in Europe do not administer “primary exploitation rights”, as indicated before).

So there is in fact no need to develop any parallel systems, which would indeed be
counterproductive. Above that, it seems unclear, whether such a registration system would be
voluntary or obligatory, public or private and if it would be for the identification of rightholders only
or otherwise what rights it would grant. That means it is unclear whether it should be a simple
register which keeps a record of concluded contracts, or if it is supposed to grant copyright
protection.


     17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


VDFS opposes to any system that would run against the mandatory “formality prohibition” of the
Berne Convention.



                                                       6
In any way setting up such a registration system would be extremely costly, time consuming and
would likely never be reliable since it would constantly have to be kept up-to-date. So it probably
would be much more efficient to link all the individual databases that already exist and are
constantly being developed (not only but also) within the audiovisual sector.


D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

        19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector,
        and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
        databases?


In the fields of collective management, i.e. also regarding audiovisual works, lots of “International
Standars” already exist and are constantly developed.
For example the “International Standard Audiovisual Number” (ISAN) is a voluntary numbering
system and metadata scheme enabling the identification of any audiovisual work, including films,
shorts, documentaries, television programs and their related versions. ISAN provides a unique,
internationally recognised and permanent reference number for each piece of audiovisual content
registered. ISAN is being used in production and distribution systems and to drive broadcast
transmission systems, facilitating interoperability and information exchange that contributes to
improving rights management. ISAN is key to content tracking and monitoring, and has been
integrated in several watermarking and fingerprinting technologies. Collective management of rights
relies on identification systems and databases. ISAN is progressively being integrated into the
databases of audiovisual authors’ CMOs containing information on the works, their authors and
other rights holders.
Audiovisual authors’ CMOs have also developed IDA (International Documentation on Audiovisual
Works), a worldwide audiovisual rights management system and online database that authors’ CMOs
consult to get accurate information on audiovisual works and rights owners. This global database
manages original productions, versions and adaptations in other languages and formats. Each work
registration contains a minimum set of information: original titles, foreign titles, subtitles, production
companies, year and country of production, shooting languages, rights owners, ISAN number, IPI
(Interested Party Information), exploitation purposes and a unique IDA code. The audiovisual
authors’ CMOs use IDA to identify the transmitted audiovisual production and rights-owners, retrieve
and treat the information before distributing the royalties to the identified sister organisations. The
sister organisation itself will transfer these royalties to their authors. The unique IDA code is used
between CMOs when exchanging information on an audiovisual work. Before IDA, authors’ CMOs
sent requests by e-mail or mail to sister societies, meaning paperwork and rather long identification
processes. IDA facilitates their identification and the exchange of documentation between CMOs and
accelerates the transfer of payments between CMOs.
Such a database is built for the specific needs of audiovisual authors’ CMOs but uses existing tools
such as IPI and ISAN in order to avoid the duplication of efforts. It represents a significant investment
for these CMOs which will deliver benefits in the long term. IDA is a CISAC tool (the International
Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and is a part of the “CISAC Professional Rules”
and the “Binding Resolutions” for audiovisual authors’ CMOs, rules that aim to improve transparency
and quality of service for all CISAC members.
The European Union could help in building a portal giving some public information and visibility to
these tools and how they work together.




                                                     7
E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

        20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?


Yes - Please explain
VDFS believes that the term of protection should not be changed and especially not be shortened.
This would have negative impacts on the ability of rightholders to exploit their works during the
period of the exclusivity of their rights. The EU-Directive harmonising the term of protection of
copyright and certain related rights recalled that the Berne Convention lays down only minimum
terms of protection, leaving Contracting States free to grant longer terms. As certain Member States
had exercised this entitlement, the resulting differences between national laws were considered as
distorting competition in the internal market, which justified harmonisation to make terms of
protection identical throughout the Community.

The Directive recalls that the minimum term of protection laid down by the Berne Convention (life of
the author and 50 years after his death) was intended to provide protection for the author and the
first two generations of his descendants and considered that the average lifespan in the Community
had increased, to the point where this term was no longer sufficient to cover two generations.
Therefore, in order to establish a high level of protection, which at the same time meets the
requirements of the internal market and the need to establish a legal environment conducive to the
harmonious development of literary and artistic creation in the Community, the Directive
harmonised the term of protection for copyright at 70 years after the death of the author. Therefore,
apart from harmonisation, the main reason for the extension of the term of protection from 50 to 70
years was the extension of the average lifespan in Europe.

VDFS does not see any reason linked to the digital environment that would question the duration of
terms of copyright protection.


III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.     Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU
copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


NO - Please explain
VDFS is of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide sufficient flexibility for
copyright and exceptions and limitations. There is no practical need for any new exceptions or to
make the existing exceptions under the Info-Soc-Directive mandatory, as there is no evidenced need
for such legislative changes. CMOs provide various solutions through dedicated licensing for
teaching, educational institutions, research etc. There is no problem with the fact that most
exceptions provided in EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States. The list of
exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive is very long and encompasses all possible exceptions in the
EU, but not for direct implementation by all Member States. Making this list mandatory would
severely undermine the protection of authors’ rights.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of
harmonisation of such exceptions?


NO.



                                                      8
23.     Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue?
Please explain by referring to specific cases.

VDFS is not in favour of any additional exceptions to the existing list of exceptions in the 2001
Copyright Directive.


24.     Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility
in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


NO - Please explain
VDFS is against the introduction of a US-type “fair use” exception in Europe, since it is not adapted to
EU-law and provides no legal certainty as issues can only be resolved in front of the courts. A higher
number of disputes and court cases would be fundamentally in contradiction with the Single Market
objectives.


26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?

NO - Please explain
The territoriality of exceptions and limitations matches the “territoriality principle” of copyright and
respects different legal and cultural specificities in the member states. VDFS therefore thinks, that
the territoriality of limitations and exceptions do not constitute any problems.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border
effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

It seems reasonable that fair compensation is due in the place where the end user benefits from the
exception, as is the case, for example, with the private copying exception (levies are due in the
country in which the “harm” to the rightholder arises, i.e. in the country in which the end user who
bought the product resides according to the “Opus ruling” of the CJUE). In addition, it is crucial that
remuneration is provided to the rightholders in the country where they reside, which is possible
because of reciprocal agreements between collective management organisations.


A. Access to content in libraries and archives

1. Preservation and archiving

28. (b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or
archives of the preservation exception?

NO


     31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?



As far as “film heritage institutions” are concerned, the 2001 Copyright Directive provides for
carefully crafted exceptions addressing the needs of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments, museums and archives. These exceptions allow film archive institutions to fulfil their
public interest missions.



                                                        9
Above these exceptions, various European CMOs have offered their help to film and audiovisual
archives institutions on many occasions to address their needs in relation to the use of the
cinematographic and audiovisual works contained in their collections and their related authors’
rights. This has resulted in specific arrangements in a number of countries: collective agreements in
France, mandatory collective administration of broadcasters’ archives in Switzerland, extended
collective agreements in the Netherlands and in the Nordic countries, etc.

The Commission should work as a facilitator to encourage film archive institutions and their
European representatives to explore the possibility of further agreements with audiovisual authors’
organisations whether at national or EU level.

2. Off-premises access to library collections


32. (c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide
remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for
NO


3. E-lending

36. (c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials
electronically, including across borders?

NO


39. What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or
public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?


Because of the nature of the internet, the difference between libraries’ traditional activities and
online consultation and e-lending is huge. The conditions for these new activities have to be
discussed with authors’ representative organisations like CMOs through licencing processes which
will allow libraries to develop these new activities and for authors to be remunerated.


4. Mass digitisation


40. Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that
out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

NO OPINION


41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of content
(e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

YES – Please explain

VDFS is fully committed to pursue the project that was started in the “Licences for Europe”
(Audiovisual and Film Heritage Institutions) process and to find a way to undertake mass digitization
and clearance for online uses of the high volume of older works in the archives of film heritage
institutions and public services broadcasters. Audiovisual authors’ CMOs have a central role to play in
helping these institutions preserve and offer to the public the cultural heritage of great works.


                                                     10
Thanks to the “Statement of Principles and Procedures for heritage films online” concluded between
ACE, FERA, FIAPF and the SAA during “Licences for Europe”, film heritage institutions and
rightholders’ representatives now have a clear roadmap to discuss and agree terms for digitizing,
restoring and making available European film heritage. It will enable film heritage institutions to free
up European films stored in their archives while guaranteeing rightholders an appropriate share of
the rewards.

As far as broadcasters’ archives are concerned, no broad agreement including all stakeholders could
be reached during the “Licences for Europe” timeframe. EBU and the SAA together developed some
recommendations highlighting that collective licensing solutions are particularly suitable for the large
scale clearance of rights. This would help make a very significant amount of works available,
particularly for research and educational purposes. Further discussions are needed to develop a MoU
or any other type of general agreement that would propose a suitable solution for mass digitization
and rights clearance of broadcasters’ archives based on collective management.



B. Teaching


42. (b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching
purposes? How successful are they?
45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which activities of
the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


VDFS is of the opinion that the current international and European provisions provide the necessary
flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations. There is currently no need to introduce any
new exceptions, as for e.g. teaching, educational institutions, research etc. already sufficient
exceptions exist.


C. Research

51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

52.What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How successful are they?

NO.

F. User-generated content


58. (c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other
subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?

YES - Please explain
A major part of user-generated content (UGC), which can be found on the internet, requires in
principle a prior licence from the rightholders whose works are used. Whether amateur or
professional, creative works are subject to the same copyright rules. That means that the use of
existing protected works needs to be authorised by the rightholder, unless an exception can be
invoked.
Of course “social media platforms” have vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the
potential economic impact for rightholders of the pre-existing works. Audiovisual authors do not
oppose UGC in principle. They are very familiar with creative processes which use pre-existing works,
in particular in the audiovisual sector where films very often use recorded music and documentaries
are sometimes made of extracts of older works. The process is therefore not new, particularly for
professional authors, and authorisation guarantees respect for “moral rights”.
Unfortunately the European legislator has not harmonized “moral rights” within the EU yet, which of
course is a very important aspect, when talking about UGC.
What is a real problem with UGC is the claim of some users creating UGC content - without seeking
the prior permission of the authors of the pre-existing works - for recognition of their rights on the
new works. This is unacceptable, as it recognizes the rights of the creator of the new work, but fails
to acknowledge the rights of the original rightholder, i.e. the owner of the pre-existing work(s) on the
basis of which the new work was created.
The essence of this activity renders any court proceedings ineffective: rightholders would probably
win the case from a legal perspective, but the costs of the proceedings largely outweigh the possible
financial benefit. This is also the reason why there are very few court cases for the “illegal
downloading” of protected works by internet users for their own benefit. Unfortunately the
“Licences for Europe” initiative was unable to deliver on this issue, due to the opposition of users’
groups to any licensing solutions as they favor the introduction of a new exception to authors’ rights.

In our view, the solution to user-generated content lies in licensing schemes concluded between
rightholders’ representatives such as audiovisual authors’ CMOs and the social media platforms as
well as micro-licences for small users, unless an exception is applicable. In fact, many examples of
licensing schemes are already being developed (e.g. in the music sector) and should be encouraged
and promoted.




                                                     12
61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


The use of pre-existing protected works to create user-generated content needs the authorisation of
the authors or their representatives (in particular, to guarantee respect for moral rights), unless an
exception can be invoked.
VDFS is ready to consider ways in which existing exceptions relevant to user-generated content (such
as “quotation” and “parody”, which could be adapted to better accommodate user-generated
content), without there being a need to create new exceptions.
A Commission Communication on UGC to clarify what uses are allowed and give an opinion on what
exceptions are relevant may be useful. Anything falling outside these exceptions should be dealt with
via simple licensing solutions. These licensing mechanisms should be devised to ensure that very
personal uses would cost virtually nothing in terms of licensing fees and the cost of licenses generally
would be proportionate to the use made of the works. It is noteworthy that internet platforms
should not be the main beneficiaries of the success of UGC, so licenses with the platforms rather
than only with the individuals themselves, should be primarily sought.


63. If your view is that a different solution (non-legislative) is needed, what would it be?



VDFS is of the opinion that anything falling outside the existing exceptions should be dealt with via
simple licensing solutions.


IV. Private copying and reprography

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and
reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

NO - Please explain
The CJEU has given necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of private
copying exception and since the interpretation of other substantive issues are currently pending with
the Court, there is no need to deal further with the scope and application of the system at EU level.
Rightholders have provided all the necessary practical and operational solutions to implement those
decisions for a smoother and more streamlined functioning of the Internal Market.
Currently the only missing element is the willingness of the manufacturers and distributors of
recording devices (almost all of which are non-EU companies) to comply with EU law.


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been
licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying
levies?

YES - Please explain
“Licensing” and application of “private copying levies” co-exist and they are not mutually exclusive.
This point of view has already been clarified by the CJEU in its “VG Wort vs. Kyocera” ruling.

One of Mr. Vitorino’s recommendations (“licensed copies do not cause harm”) suggests that all
subsequent copies made of a work following purchase from digital services can be covered by
licenses granted by rightholders to these services. Mr. Vitorino therefore proposed to eliminate



                                                       13
levies for “new business models in the digital environment”. This is based on a gross misconception
of both the private copying system and the multitude of new digital services which provide access to
protected works. Private copies cannot be licensed since they are covered by a statutory exception to
copyright under the 2001/29 Copyright Directive.

Therefore “licensing” and “fair compensation for private copying” can only be separate issues.
Moreover, if the private copying exception was questioned and private copies inserted into licences,
the ones that would suffer most from such a change would be consumers and authors, the
consumers losing their freedom to copy and the authors their fair compensation.

In practice, the authorisation, licence fee and commercial terms are negotiated by the holders of
exclusive rights with each digital service during the licensing process, whereas fair compensation is
collected through the levy system and distributed to rightholders by CMOs. Mr. Vitorino’s proposal
derives from the flawed idea that digital services would allow rightholders to be compensated
directly. In practice, only few rightholders or categories of rightholders grant licences to digital
services (the producers or further intermediaries).

Other rightholders, such as audiovisual authors who transferred their exclusive rights to the producer
sometimes for a lump-sum payment, do not have any direct relation with digital services and
therefore, no possibility to be paid directly.

In this field, a huge advantage of the private copying system is that it corrects inequalities between
rightholders and guarantees that each category of rightholders benefits from a fair share of the
value.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on
cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development
and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


VDFS believes that the application of levies to certain online services is justified and does not think
that it would hinder the development and functioning of new business models. One of the main
reasons is that, just like the prices of products across Europe do not vary in proportion to the levy
rates, the prices of online services/new business models are most probably also unaffected by the
levy rates.
More copying for private use takes place now than ever before. The devices and media which enable
or host private copies of protected works have increased, with storage capacities which have grown
exponentially.
Consumers transfer songs and videos from computers to hard drives to phones to tablets to online
lockers and back again in order to save and access their personal libraries whenever and wherever
they want. All of these processes are undeniably acts of private copying.
In addition, in line with the principle of technical neutrality, copies made via “cloud services” (and
other future digital services which do not yet exist) many have the same purpose (private use) as the
copies made by private individuals on their phones, tablets, etc. so should be included in the private
copying system.
Applying private copying to certain cloud-based services means that copies made on those specific
cloud-based services would be taken into account by usage studies which assess the harm caused.




                                                   14
67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?


YES - Please explain


VDFS totally agrees with the objective, but does not believe that this technical point requires a
legislative change at EU level within the Info-Soc Directive. This is certainly not a big problem in terms
of cross-border application of levies. In fact, it is already applied in some Member States and its
application can easily be extended to all Member States with the agreement of all stakeholders
involved.
Past and recent consultation processes on private copying levies have shown that stakeholders agree
that levies should be clearly visible on all bills and contracts in the products’ sales chain (this is for
example already the case in Belgium thanks to a new Belgian law applicable since 1st of December
2013) and on consumers’ invoices and till receipts.
In addition, consumers should be informed of the amount and destination of the levies and more
generally the reason for this mechanism which compensates the freedom to copy they have thanks
to the private copying exception. This would help consumers understand how important the levy
system is for the EU’s culture and rightholders and that they are part of and benefit from this
virtuous system.


68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or
duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

NO - Please explain

The CJEU has already clarified all these issues in its recent judgments. As long as the rulings of the
Court are followed, there is no need for any further legislative “clarification” at EU level.

Following the “Opus ruling” by the CJEU the rule would be that the levy is due in the Member State in
which the final user who purchased the product resides since that is where the “harm” to the
rightholder would arise. In any case, even if undue levy payments occasionally did occur, “ex-ante
exemptions” and “ex-post-reimbursement systems” should be in place to ensure that such
equipment does not bear levies.


69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes
clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain
in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).


VDFS of course acknowledges that devices and blank media can serve other purposes than for the
private copying of protected works. This should be taken into account when determining tariffs
applicable to devices used to make private copies. In addition, there are cases where certain devices
and media will clearly not be used for the purpose of private copying (e.g. “professional uses”). In
this context, ex-ante-exemptions and ex-post-reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure
that the equipment concerned does not bear levies. However, exempting any business from private
copying levies would be excessive, since equipment bought by companies can also generate private
copies (e.g. business handys that are also used to store music for private use).
It is important to point out that the determining factor should in any way be the nature of the use,
not the quality of the purchaser.
As recommended by the CJEU in the “Padawan”ruling (C-467/08), professional uses should be
excluded from payment of the levy, but not necessarily all purchases of professional users. Devices


                                                      15
such as tablets or smartphones, despite being the property of a company, may well in fact be used by
employees to copy protected works for private use. Recommending that private copying levies
should apply exclusively to purchases by natural persons as private users would artificially reduce the
scope of the private copying system.
Exemption and refund systems for professional uses should be designed at national level in
consideration of the specificities of the Member States concerned.
The “Austro-Mechana” CJEU ruling (C-521/11) confirmed that reimbursement schemes for the levies
paid on devices that are not ultimately used for private purposes comply with EU law, as long as they
are effectively applied and do not constitute an excessive burden for those who are entitled to
reimbursement.


70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a
priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy
the situation?

Please see our responses above.


71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these
problems best be solved?


Firstly the rightholders’ proposal to introduce a single declaration point would facilitate declaration
and payment procedures by manufacturers/importers. The proposal to create a single European
declaration was put forward by European rightholders during the 2008-2009 dialogue, and agreed
with the ICT industry. It aims to facilitate the implementation of the “Opus” ruling of the CJEU (C-
462/09). Via the “European Central Point” mechanism, distance sellers could submit declarations of
sales of goods eligible to private copying levies at a single EU entry point, while the compensation
would be invoiced and paid in the country of destination.
Secondly, the most efficient and cost-effective way to collect levies is to do so at the earliest stage of
the sales chain, i.e. the manufacture or import stage. Shifting the liability to pay levies onto retailers,
as proposed by Mr. Vitorino, would render the system extremely complex and costly since this would
significantly increase the number of those responsible for paying the levies and the means needed to
ensure billing and control systems.
The prime responsibility of manufacturers and importers for payment of the levies must go hand in
hand with joint liability of all entities throughout the chain of sales down to the final consumer in
order to avoid potential fraud and unfair competition. This principle was also agreed between
representatives of rightholders and the ICT industry during the 2008-2009 dialogue.
Thirdly, the fact that leviable devices and blank media differ across Member States means that the
same product can be subject to private copying levies in a Member State and not in another.
Compensation systems should be in place for all devices and media whose value is increased by
multimedia storage and playback features. Therefore, a consistent definition of devices and media
subject to private copying levies in the respective Member States should be sought. Rightholders’
organisations proposed during the 2008-2009 dialogue that all products (devices and media) able to
be used to make private copies of protected works should be eligible for the private copying
compensation scheme, with a list of products established and regularly updated at EU level.
However, the interruption of the dialogue by the ICT industry in 2010 did not end in any concrete
result and the Vitorino report was a missed opportunity as, despite suggesting a degree of
harmonisation (such as regarding the definition of harm), Mr. Vitorino recommended Member State
flexibility in the choice of devices subject to levies.




                                                     16
Fourthly, VDFS agrees that a quick and harmonised levy setting procedure should be developed
across Europe. This would mean putting in place a European framework of definitions, principles and
procedures to be respected by all Member States in the establishment of their levy setting process.


V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate
remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?


Fair remuneration of authors is a very important issue related in particular to the online distribution
of audiovisual works. For audiovisual authors, such a “best mechanism” to ensure that they receive
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of their works does not yet exist. “Adequate
remuneration” should relate to the use made of the authors’ works and should in particular reward
the success of works. This is why “buy-out contracts”, which prevent this from happening, would
never amount to mechanisms guaranteeing adequate remuneration.
Contractual practices in the vast majority of European countries deprive audiovisual authors of their
rights and prevent them from receiving fair remuneration, not only but in particular for the online
distribution of their works. Audiovisual authors in most countries are forced, because of their weak
bargaining position and the absence of legislation to protect them, to assign all their rights and
receive a one-off fee at the production stage with no further payments linked to the exploitation of
the work, except for collectively managed rights such as “cable retransmission” and “private
copying”.
These further payments linked to the exploitation of the work (which can continue for years) are
however essential for authors to make a living in-between projects. The characteristic of this
profession is that it can take years to prepare a film and enter into production.
VDFS therefore proposes to by-pass these unfair contractual practices and to develop a sustainable
remuneration system which would secure audiovisual authors’ remuneration for their making
available right in the digital market, taking advantage of the new technologies.
Such a proposal for European legislation builds on the harmonisation experience in the EU, e.g. the
1992 Rental Right Directive which provides for an “unwaivable remuneration right for the rental” or
the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive which provides for mandatory collective administration of the
“cable retransmission right”.
Concerning “online uses” and in the case an audiovisual author has transferred his making available
right to a producer, he should retain the right to obtain “equitable remuneration” for the “making
available” which cannot be waived, as it is the case for the “rental right”. The equitable remuneration
should be paid by audiovisual media services that make audiovisual works available to the public on-
demand. Its administration should be entrusted to collective management organisations
representing audiovisual authors, unless other audiovisual authors’ organisations, such as unions or
guilds, are in a better position to guarantee such remuneration in a specific country.
This European legislation is a necessity as contractual practices are unable to guarantee such
remuneration to audiovisual authors for the making available of their works. European producers,
which are mainly small companies, are very much focused on the production stage and little involved
in the subsequent exploitation. They have therefore not developed industrial processes and
mechanisms to trace and administer payments due to authors for the distribution of their works on
multiple platforms and most of them would prefer not to do it at all since it would be costly. The only
entities to do this are authors’ collective management organisations. They are today ready to invest
further in order to address the remuneration due to audiovisual authors for the online distribution of
their works.
It has to be clarified that this proposal does not interfere with the producer’s role. It aims at
organising the remuneration due to authors, once the producer has decided to make the work


                                                  17
available to the public in such a manner and at the time he chooses. It therefore means that any on-
demand exploitation of an audiovisual work will continue to have to be cleared with the producer or
with the making available right holder appointed by the producer or subsequent contractor.
Be it offline or online exploitations, collective management is the best solution to strike a balance
between easy rights clearance, legal certainty and adequate remuneration for audiovisual authors.


73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?


YES - Please explain
VDFS supports an intervention by the Commission into contractual practices. Indeed, we support
fairer contractual terms and practices, whilst acknowledging that this will not solve all the problems,
in particular the remuneration issue of audiovisual authors for the exploitation of their works. Any
initiative in this field should therefore at least complement the introduction into EU legislation of an
unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making available right, based on
the revenues generated from the online distribution of their works and collected by collective
management organisations from final distributors.


74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the
shortcomings you identify?


In most European countries, audiovisual authors suffer from unfair contractual terms (excessive
transfer of rights in terms of scope and duration, transfer of rights to remuneration, etc.) imposed by
producers or broadcasters in the individual negotiation of their contract. These negotiations too
often result in “buy-out contracts”, authors receiving a lump sum payment for the writing and/or
directing of the film, with no further payment no matter how commercially successful the film goes
on to be. Even when authors sign contracts which respect their economic interests and provide for
additional remuneration, they rarely receive any payment automatically, except when collective rules
are in place and enforced in particular by collective rights management organisations.
In parallel to European initiatives to ensure proper remuneration of authors, consideration should be
given to developing key standards for fair and enforceable contractual terms in individual contracts,
including the prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.
In addition, one way of ensuring the enforceability of fair contractual terms would be that producers
applying for public funds for the production of films and audiovisual works should be obliged to
provide a copy of authors’ contracts among the documentation. The body providing for the financial
support would have the obligation to check it. This would be a strong incentive for producers to
better respect authors’ rights as it would become a pre-condition for obtaining public financial
support.


V. Respect for rights
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright
committed with a commercial purpose?


NO - Please explain
The scope of the question and clarifications of the civil enforcement system in the EU should not be
limited to infringements committed with a “commercial purpose”. All infringements should be
punished, but of course sanctions should be more severe for commercial purpose infringements.
Leaving all “non-commercial” acts out of protection would not comply with the respect for the
exclusive rights provided by international and European copyright law.


                                                        18
VDFS believes that the respect for rights and the enforcement of rights are as important as the scope
and definition of the rights themselves. The “safe harbour regime” provided by the “E-Commerce-
Directive” should therefore be re-considered for copyright related activities.


76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain
name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?


VDFS welcomes recent national court decisions which are clarifying the role of intermediaries in the
IP enforcement infrastructure. They are increasingly required to carry out an active role and take on
responsibilities.
We also strongly encourage the Commission to examine the possibility of integrating a “notice and
takedown” type mechanism in the future revised Enforcement Directive. In addition the notification
procedure (and the information to be provided) as well as the impact of this procedure, i.e. the
action to be taken by the hosting provider (immediate take down, or as quickly as possible within 24
hours) and stay down of illegal content (not just the links to it) should be harmonised.
In addition, cooperation between rightholders and intermediaries could also lead to the
development of useful “filtering technologies” which could be developed by platforms and
implemented at the stage when users upload content onto their servers. This filtering technology
would be based on databases of works which have been registered, with a view to identifying and
blocking illegal content. In this context, cooperation between rights holders and providers is an
essential key to developing such databases of protected content and should therefore be
encouraged.


77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right
to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of
personal data?



NO – Please explain

According to the Court of Justice of the European Union a fair balance must be struck between the
various rights at stake (such as the right to data protection and the right to property, which includes
IPR) given that both are recognised as fundamental rights by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
the European Union.
In addition, the limited scope of the right to information to acts carried out on a commercial scale
(article 8 of the Directive) prevents the full exercise of the right to information in all infringing
situations.
The Commission should take the opportunity of any revision of the Enforcement Directive to
guarantee an effective balance between IPR and the data protection right, in order to allow the
provision on the right of information to effectively protect right holders.




                                                    19
VII. A single EU copyright title

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a
consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for
enforcement?
NO


79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of
difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?



VDFS does not see the need for “an optional unitary EU Copyright Title” as already proposed by the
Commission in its “Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works”. This proposal was
first made by the Commission in 2009 and then repeated in several documents but the Commission
never explained the need for and the use of such a title. The only information delivered in the Green
Paper was that “authors or producers of audiovisual works would have the option to register their
works and then obtain a single title that would be valid throughout the EU”. This very brief
presentation raises two questions: the registration condition and the nature of the title.
In terms of copyright protection, the Berne Convention prohibits any formality such as registration as
a condition for the enjoyment and exercise of rights. Authors are very much attached to this
prohibition which guarantees their rights in all circumstances as far as their creation is original and
therefore deserves protection. Consequently, authors are very reluctant to see any system based on
registration as it endangers their authorship of works.
From a practical point of view, to pursue such a proposal, the Commission should then either
undertake to revise the Berne convention or to define the nature of the title out of the copyright
sphere.
Because of the formality prohibition, such titles do not exist in the copyright sphere. The only existing
registries in the audiovisual sector have limited scope and impact which do not affect rights’
protection and exercise (for example the necessary work declaration to an authors’ society for an
author to receive related payments, or the French cinema public registry which offers the statutory
publication of certain contracts).



VIII. Other issues

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain
and indicate how such matters should be addressed.



VDFS believes that creators should be placed at the centre of EU copyright policy. After years of
distrust and attacks against copyright by users’ and consumers’ groups who want to undermine a
system that they do not consider fit for the digital age, there is an essential need to give back
legitimacy to a system that promotes creativity, freedom of expression and dissemination of culture.
The best way to provide legitimacy to the copyright system is to reconnect it to creators and ensure
that creators are the first and main beneficiaries of the licence fees and remuneration paid by users.
The current European copyright law does not provide for such a guarantee, except in limited cases
(e.g. the unwaivable right to equitable remuneration for the rental right) and evokes criticisms that it
only works to the benefit of major entertainment companies (a few big labels and publishers).

There is therefore a need to rebalance European copyright policy in favour of authors and other
creators as original rightholders. This needs to be the focus and priority of any forthcoming copyright
reform.
This is a win-win solution for users and for all rightholders as it would clarify that creators are the
main beneficiaries of the copyright system and therefore strengthen its legitimacy and its
enforcement, not only but in particular online.
The digital age has presented CMOs with a set of major challenges to many aspects of their
operations. The analogue world has been replaced by one characterised by mass uses and
transactions of copyright works, lower values of licences for transactions and much greater flexibility
in the type of uses being made and the devices on which uses take place. CMOs have adapted to this
– and continue to do so – by doing the following:

    •   Investing in new technology, software and systems to keep their licensing operations fit for
        purpose
    •   Improving their governance, transparency and accountability to members and users
    •   Simplifying their licensing procedures to reduce transaction costs
    •   Innovating in the kind of licences being offered
    •   Making it a central objective to see the works of members receive the greatest possible
        legitimate distribution
    •   Promoting the use of copyright works for education and cultural purposes
    •   Making it a priority to engage young people directly whether they are users or creators of
        copyright works – and sometimes both at the same time – so that they learn respect for the
        value of creativity and are encouraged to express themselves creatively.

We feel that the tone of the debate over copyright has so far been far too confrontational. Our
desire is to see a much healthier relationship develop between creators and the audiences for their
works.
