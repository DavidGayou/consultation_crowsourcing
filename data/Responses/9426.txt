  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?



   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?

( NO

See our answers to questions 2 and 3.





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

( NO

There  are  plenty  of  online  music  services  providing  services  across
borders. The biggest  ‘problem’  for  online  services  seeking  to  provide
online services across borders in the EU is probably  insufficient  consumer
demand. While the current legislative framework  enables  the  licensing  of
works on a cross-border and  pan-European  basis  (and  these  licences  are
available to any  service  wishing  to  launch  such  cross-border  or  pan-
European services), most services choose to launch  territory  by  territory
because  citizens  usually  want  to  use  nationally-based  services,  even
if/when these services are used to reach repertoire from other countries.


In the music sector, hundreds of legal  services  are  available  throughout
Europe (over 260 according to IFPI) and, as demonstrated by the  conclusions
reached  by  the  Licences   for   Europe   (European   Commission-initiated
stakeholder dialogue which took place throughout  2013)  music  subgroup  of
working  group  1  (“cross-border  access  and  portability  of  services”),
national repertoire in all languages from across the EU is widely  available
in every EU country.


The music subgroup  also  found  that  portability  is  provided  by  online
services when travelling or residing abroad. Regarding  access  to  services
from other countries, access  to  playlists  abroad  is  possible.  Consumer
demand for cross-border  access  is  therefore  met  since  the  main  music
services, which are available  in  every  EU  country,  hold  virtually  all
international and local repertoires. So, for example, a consumer located  or
residing in Belgium will be able to  access  not  only  the  full  array  of
international  and  Belgian  repertoire  but  also  practically  all   local
repertoire of other member states.







   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


While it is true that copyright remains territorial,  multi-territorial  and
pan-European (and often worldwide) licences have  been  available  for  many
years from  record  companies.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  existing
territorial restrictions  are  often  due  to  online  services’  commercial
strategies, which IMPALA respects.


Independent music labels have joined forces to launch global  rights  agency
Merlin a few years ago  (http://www.merlinnetwork.org/).  Merlin  represents
its independent members in new media deals that cannot be easily  negotiated
locally  or  individually,  or  are  not  covered  adequately  by   existing
arrangements. Merlin offers means for  digital  music  services  to  license
repertoire from a basket of independent rights. Merlin is a good example  of
an initiative helping license  a  wide  variety  of  smaller  repertoire  as
widely as possible, and  therefore  bringing  this  repertoire  to  as  many
consumers as possible.


Lots of efforts have been made by  the  cultural  and  creative  sectors  to
allow new online uses to develop,  especially  in  the  music  sector  where
hundreds of  legal  services  are  available  throughout  Europe  (over  260
according to IFPI). Worldwide, pan-European and  multi-territorial  licences
for sound recordings and other musical works are available to services  that
wish to get such licences in order to operate across borders without  having
to deal with national licences. As noted by the European Commission  in  the
introduction to this question, the Collective Rights  Management  Directive,
which has now been adopted, seeks to  further  facilitate  the  availability
and delivery of such multi-territorial licences.


As demonstrated by the conclusions reached by the Licences for Europe  music
subgroup of  working  group  1  (“cross-border  access  and  portability  of
services”), digital music services have developed vastly  in  the  last  few
years in Europe. In 2013, over 260 music services were available in  Europe,
over 30 million tracks available in every EU country, with certain  services
(e.g. iTunes, Deezer, 7 Digital, YouTube and Myspace) available  in  all  EU
countries. Other services (Spotify, Google  Play,  etc.)  are  available  in
many  EU  countries  and  planning  expansion  into  new  countries.   Music
services have different commercial strategies, with some trying to cover  as
many territories as possible at once,  while  others  build  their  business
country by country. Practice shows that plaftforms often decide  to  go  for
the latter approach and gradually launch country by  country.  There  are  a
number of commercial reasons  for  this  choice:  testing  business  models,
costs and technicalities associated  with  launching  a  service  in  a  new
country (tailoring the  site,  service  and  offers  to  target  a  national
audience), establishing local partnerships with Internet  Service  Providers
(ISPs) and advertisers, proximity to local consumers.


The music subgroup also found that  national  repertoire  in  all  languages
from across the EU is widely available in every EU country.


The music subgroup was also asked to look at the issue  of  portability  and
access to services from other countries. The findings were that  portability
is  provided  by  online  services  when  travelling  or  residing   abroad,
including downloading works  on  any  device,  synchronising  through  cloud
storage and streaming services. Regarding  access  to  services  from  other
countries, access to playlists abroad is possible – when  limitations  exist
to cross-border access, they are the result  of  each  service’s  design  to
meet its operational needs and optimise the consumer experience by  adapting
to local markets. Consumer demand for cross-border access is  therefore  met
because the main music services, which are available in  every  EU  country,
hold virtually all international and local repertoires. So, for  example,  a
consumer located or residing in Belgium will be able to access not only  the
full array of international and Belgian repertoire but also practically  all
local repertoire of other member states.


In light of the above, we dispute – when it comes to the music sector –  the
assertion in question A that “it is  not  possible  to  access  many  online
content services from anywhere in Europe”, and  the  further  statements  in
the introduction to question A that “there are continued problems  with  the
cross-border  provision  of,  and  access  to,  services”  and  that  “these
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services  that  are
made available in Member States other than the one in which they  live”.  As
mentioned above, while some music services  seek  to  cover  all  EU  member
states, others choose to target only one or a few member states – that is  a
business decision which must be respected.  The  assumption  that  consumers
are ‘entitled’ to any online service, even those  located  in  other  member
states and targeting other  consumers,  is  biased  and  somewhat  seems  to
reflect  an  ongoing  change  from  ‘consumer  empowerment’   to   ‘consumer
entitlement’: while creators and right holders are trying to accommodate  as
far as possible consumers’ high expectations  when  it  comes  to  accessing
creative  works  anywhere/anytime,  one  must  understand  that  a  lot   of
different  stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  creation,  production   and
distribution of a single work, and things sometimes have  to  be  taken  one
step at a time. Just because a service is not available in a single  country
and citizens want this service to be available in  their  country  does  not
mean that this will happen overnight, there  are  many  other  variables  at
play and services have to take all variables into account  before  launching
what they hope to be a successful business in a given country.


Regarding consumers being redirected to the  service  designated  for  their
country of residence when trying to  access  the  same  service  in  another
Member State, nobody seems to raise concerns  regarding  the  same  type  of
‘redirection’ by services such as Google (for example if you try  to  access
Google.com from Belgium you will be redirected to Google.be).


Finally, while it is in everybody’s interest to have  a  better  circulation
of  all  music  repertoire  across  borders,  we  would  urge  against   the
temptation to go too far in terms of ‘homogenisation’ of  the  market  given
the risk of going against the EU’s core  principle  of  preserving  cultural
diversity. As mentioned in our response to  question  7,  a  2012  study  by
European Music Office/Eurosonic-Noorderslag/Nielsen  demonstrated  the  lack
of circulation of European music across borders.  The  study  revealed  that
the only repertoire circulating effectively across Europe is US  repertoire.
The share of US repertoire in  the  countries  surveyed  was  over  50%  for
airplay and just below 50% for downloads.  Too  much  harmonisation  of  the
market  would  be  to  the  detriment  of  local  repertoire  and   cultural
diversity, and would mostly benefit Anglo-American repertoire. As  mentioned
elsewhere in our response (see for example question 7), in the music  sector
SMEs (99% of music operators) are  crucial  to  diversity,  discovering  and
developing new artists and  new  trends  of  music,  producing  80%  of  all
releases in Europe today. However, they represent only  20%  of  the  market
share. In our response to question 7 we list a series of  concrete  measures
that could help level the playing  field  and  ensure  that  the  regulatory
framework delivers diversity and availability of content.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


It is very important for independent music  companies,  which  play  a  very
important role in  developing  local  artists  and  repertoire  (music  SMEs
produce 80% of all releases in Europe), to make  sure  local  repertoire  is
available on all services. We have listed, in our response to question 7,  a
series  of  measures  that  we  believe  could  help  guarantee  that  local
repertoire and artists are available to all citizens.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

( NO

As mentioned in our response to question 3, while it is true that  copyright
remains  territorial,   multi-territorial   and   pan-European   (and   even
worldwide) licences have been available for many years. To the best  of  our
knowledge,  existing  territorial  restrictions  are  often  due  to  online
services’ commercial strategies, which IMPALA respects.  As  also  mentioned
in our response to question 3, in the music sector most if not  all  content
is available on most available services across territories.





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

( YES

See response to question 3. Practice shows that plaftforms often  decide  to
gradually launch their service country by country. There  are  a  number  of
commercial reasons for this  choice:  testing  business  models,  costs  and
technicalities  associated  with  launching  a  service  in  a  new  country
(tailoring the site, service and offers to target a  national  audience  and
meet local demand), establishing local partnerships  with  Internet  Service
Providers (ISPs) and advertisers, proximity to local consumers.





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

( NO

In the music sector, we do not feel like  any  new  legislative  measure  is
needed to increase the cross-border availability of  content  services.  The
market is delivering, with  hundreds  of  services  and  millions  of  songs
available to all citizens.


The existing legislative framework has proved flexible enough to respond  to
consumer demand and accommodate market developments (new services).


However, we believe that a number of measures could help level  the  playing
field to make sure all repertoire is treated the same, irrespective  whether
acts are signed on a small or big record company, and  to  make  sure  local
repertoire is not left out. Cultural diversity it at stake and it  is  clear
that the market, if left to its own devices, will not automatically  deliver
diversity.


While music rightholders have made big efforts over the past years  to  make
licensing easier for music services, one important  concern  of  independent
music companies is to make sure local and diverse content  is  available  on
music  services.  The  online  market  is  full  of  opportunities  and  the
availability of content remains a serious concern, in particular  for  music
SMEs. In the music sector, SMEs are crucial to  diversity,  discovering  and
developing new artists and  new  trends  of  music,  producing  80%  of  all
releases in Europe today. However, they represent only  20%  of  the  market
share. 99% of music operators are  micro,  small  and  medium  sized.  These
music SMEs cannot compete on the same level as Majors and therefore  do  not
have the same access to radio/TV and online services.

The music market is extremely concentrated,  which  gives  an  advantage  to
bigger companies. The recorded music market is concentrated in the hands  of
three companies. In the music sector, given the size of the three  remaining
‘Majors’, which own  the  biggest  Anglo-American  repertoire  and  together
represent as much as 80% of the market share, and even more for  ‘hits’  (It
was recently announced, for example, that in the US Universal,  the  biggest
company on the sound recording side, had achieved a historic  ‘clean  sweep’
of the US top 10, and the Majors’ combined  market  share  for  Top  100  on
radio and  downloads  in  Europe  climbs  to  a  massive  95%),  it  is  not
surprising that American music dominates the charts.  In  Europe,  Sony  and
Universal, the two biggest Majors, together control over 75% of  hits,  even
although music SMEs produce over 80% of all new releases. This has a  direct
impact  on  what  Europeans  actually  listen  to,  as  offline  and  online
broadcasters  and  services  cannot  launch  or  grow  without  the  Majors’
repertoire (which is effectively ‘must-have’ repertoire). The  concentration
on the music market has a  clear  negative  impact  on  innovation,  output,
consumer choice, pluralism of content and media,  and  creates  barriers  to
entry.

The digital market should provide opportunities, with a real  level  playing
field, for all actors regardless of their size.  In  practical  terms,  this
means competition law needs  to  stop  major  copyright  owners  carving  up
online opportunities at the expense of smaller  copyright  owners.  Services
licensing from one or more of the Majors need  to  also  engage  with  music
SMEs, on the same terms and at the same time. They also  need  to  agree  to
diversity commitments. At the same time, agreements guaranteeing output  and
placement to large content owners should be prohibited, a move  which  would
in fact help music services deal with the  excessive  market  power  of  the
major content owners.

A  2012  study  by   European   Music   Office/Eurosonic-Noorderslag/Nielsen
demonstrated the lack of circulation of European music across  borders.  The
study revealed that  the  only  repertoire  circulating  effectively  across
Europe is US repertoire.  The  share  of  US  repertoire  in  the  countries
surveyed was over 50% for airplay and just below 50% for downloads.


There are many examples of discriminatory  practices  against  independents.
In early 2013 for example, the new Myspace Music service  launched  with  no
agreement in place  with  Merlin,  the  global  digital  rights  agency  for
independent labels and  artists.  As  mentioned  above,  independent  labels
produce 80% of all new music releases. To make sure  consumers  have  access
to all music available  and  that  cultural  diversity  is  preserved,  such
services should be subject to so-called ‘must-carry’  obligations,  i.e.  an
obligation to license all repertoire.


Europe has one of the richest and most diverse music markets in  the  world,
and should be capitalising on it.

The question of ensuring the regulatory  framework  delivers  diversity  and
availability of content is one of the most important issues for music  SMEs,
and concrete measure in this respect would be  welcome.  Measures  which  we
believe would help level the playing field include the following:

- New competition rules  prioritising  SME  competitiveness,  diversity  and
consumer choice;

- Competition law needs to be modified to stop major copyright  owners  from
carving up online opportunities at the expense of smaller copyright owners;

- “Must carry” obligations for online service  that  have  become  essential
facilities like YouTube/Google. This content must  also  be  easy  to  find,
therefore we believe that online services should also be  subject  to  “must
be found” obligations.

- Supporting projects such as Merlin,  a  worldwide  digital  rights  agency
representing  the  rights  of  music  SMEs,  set  up  by  independent  music
companies to deal collectively with the digital shift;

- A non-discrimination principle for SMEs in line with  the  Small  Business
Act;

- Diversity obligations for online  services  and  platforms,  including  an
obligation to license  from  SMEs  and  an  obligation  to  refuse  to  give
placement and output type guarantees to the major content owners;

- Making parallel terms for SMEs a commercial and regulatory reality;

-  Dedicating  a  minimum  of  30%  independent  space  for  SMEs   in   all
distribution channels (e.g. radio, broadcast, digital and retail);

- Possibility of introducing a specific status for copyright SMEs;

- Conducting sector enquiries where there is a particular concern about  the
competitiveness of SMEs and whether or not there is a level playing field;

- Creating a cultural diversity  scoreboard  to  measure  Europe’s  cultural
diversity  in  terms  of  production,  distribution,  consumption  and   the
mobility of cultural works;

- Making cultural diversity impact assessments  an  essential  part  of  all
competition decisions.

- All cultural goods and services offline and online should be eligible  for
a reduced VAT rate, and there should  be  no  difference  in  rates  between
online and offline for similar goods and services. This  would  be  in  line
with the European Commission  guiding  principle  that  “similar  goods  and
services should be subject to the same VAT rate and progress  in  technology
should be taken into account in this  respect,  so  that  the  challenge  of
convergence between the online and the physical environment is addressed”.


It is important for the European Commission to be in line  with  the  UNESCO
Convention on cultural diversity, which is part of EU  law,  to  ensure  the
principle of fair and equitable access to the means of creation,  promotion,
production and distribution for all cultural  operators.  Article  167  TFEU
also  states  that  cultural  aspects  shall  be  taken  into  account  when
implementing European law. There is no inherent diversity and big  companies
have  no  economic  interest  in  providing  such  diversity.  The  European
Commission needs to make sure that music SMEs can have fair  access  to  the
market as they are essential to the development of an economy of  diversity,
and more generally to jobs and growth.


To ensure an adequate level of protection of rightholders, we refer  to  our
responses  to  questions  75  and  76  for  more  details.  With  regard  to
enforcement, the biggest challenge faced by SMEs  such  as  our  members  is
that  they  do  not  have   the   resources   necessary   to   monitor   all
platforms/shops  where  unauthorised  copies  of  their   works   might   be
available.


In light of this huge barrier to effective enforcement of their rights,  our
members call on decision-makers, and at this stage more specifically on  the
European Commission, to review the enforcement Directive in  order  to  make
enforcement more efficient, by recognising that intermediaries have  a  duty
of care –  indeed,  all  intermediaries  have  responsibilities  and  should
exercise all due diligence to stop their customers from carrying out  and/or
aiding large-scale infringement. ‘Due diligence’ should be  better  defined,
as well as ‘commercial scale’.


Law enforcement authorities should also  be  encouraged  to  ‘go  after  the
money’ – behind many sites  offering  infringing  works  are  people  making
money off the creators’ work without investing a penny into  this  work.  It
should be possible to go after the people/businesses making  commercial  use
of these infringing works, through  advertisements,  subscriptions,  selling
of behavioural data, etc. In order for this to happen, the collaboration  of
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is of outmost importance.


The facilitation and encouragement of mass distribution of  illegal  content
must be addressed efficiently. In  our  view,  this  can  only  be  done  by
reviewing  the  exemption  from   liability   for   services   substantially
benefitting from the dissemination of illegal content. In  other  words,  we
think the liability exemptions/safe harbour provisions should be  abolished,
hence  removing  YouTube  and  other  similar  services’   right   to   make
copyrighted works available without a licence.


A recent study produced by Google confirmed that  a  substantial  amount  of
internet traffic to pirate sites come from  search  engines  (1/6th  of  the
total). Search engines should also stop listing links  to  pirate  sites  in
their search results, or at least move them down the search results.
















B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of  what  needs  to
   be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

        1. The act of “making available”




   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

( YES

The ‘making available’ right is an exclusive right for  authors,  performers
and phonogram producers (such as our members) to authorise or  prohibit  the
dissemination of their  works  through  interactive  networks.  The  act  of
making available is subject to the control  of  the  phonogram  producer  or
other rights owners from the moment the work or phonogram is  accessible  to
members of the public, regardless of whether it has  been  accessed  yet  or
not. This allows rightholders to retain control over  the  dissemination  of
phonograms in digital networks,  which  effectively  constitutes  a  primary
form of exploitation of music.

The scope of the “making available”  right  in  cross-border  situations  is
sufficiently clear. There is  no  need  to  clarify  where  the  content  is
accessed or accessible. Any of the  possible  changes  referred  to  in  the
introduction to this question would not be beneficial.

It would be difficult to decide who’s effectively “targeted”  by  a  service
provider (e.g. if the website is only in English, should  it  be  considered
as not targeting any country where the official language is  not  English?),
and in the case where content is received by a user who  is  not  ‘targeted’
by the content provider, the ‘targeting’ criteria would  render  enforcement
impossible.

The “country of origin” principle could  lead  to  ‘forum  shopping',  hence
severely limiting the scope of the making available right.




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

( YES

Any changes to the territorial scope of the “making available”  right  would
have a negative impact on the recognition of our members’ rights,  on  their
remuneration and on the enforcement of their  rights.  No  clarification  of
the territorial scope is needed.


Our members’ rights, including the  making  available  right,  are  licensed
without any particular difficulty.


Regarding enforcement of  our  members’  right,  the  clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right is not needed.





1 Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation





  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

( NO

No, the application of two rights to a single act of  economic  exploitation
in the online environment does not create problems for our members.





2 Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

( YES

As confirmed by the Court of Justice of the EU in  its  recent  decision  in
the ‘Svensson’ case, while every act of ‘communication  of  a  work  to  the
public’ has to be authorised by the copyright holder, the  authorisation  is
not required if the work has already been authorised a  first  time  and  is
freely available online, in which case the CJEU considers that the work  has
already been ‘communicated to the public’, since no new  public  is  created
by the additional links leading  users  to  already  authorised  and  freely
available works.


So the provision of a hyperlink leading to  work  or  other  subject  matter
protected under copyright  is  not  subject  to  the  authorisation  of  the
rightholder only if the work  has  been  authorised  a  first  time  by  the
rightholder and is already freely available online.


The illegality of links directing users to unauthorised content are  clearly
confirmed by the same ruling.



  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

( NO

Temporary acts of reproduction are covered by Article  5  of  the  Copyright
Directive, which deals with exceptions and limitations. There is already  an
existing and adequate exception for temporary acts of reproduction  (Article
5.1  of  the  Copyright  Directive),  which  protects  rightholders  without
hindering legitimate online services.



Art. 5.1 Copyright Directive:

1. Temporary acts of reproduction referred to  in  Article  2  (Reproduction
right), which are transient or incidental (and) an  integral  and  essential
part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable:

(a) a transmission in a network between third parties  by  an  intermediary,
or

(b) a lawful use

of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no  independent
economic  significance,  shall  be  exempted  from  the  reproduction  right
provided for in Article 2.





3 Download to own digital content


  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

( NO



  14.  [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


Recital 29 of Directive 2001/29/EC (“Copyright Directive”) is very clear  on
this matter: “The question of exhaustion does  not  arise  in  the  case  of
services and online services in particular. (…) every online service  is  in
fact an act which should be subject to authorisation where the copyright  or
related rights so provide”.


Article 3.3 of the Copyright  Directive  further  confirms  that  exhaustion
does not apply to the right of communication to the public of works and  the
right of making available to the public.


Enabling the resale of  previously  purchased  digital  content  would  have
dramatic consequences on the primary market for the sale of creative  works.
We would oppose legislation enabling  the  resale  of  previously  purchased
content, for the following reasons:


- As mentioned in the European Commission’s introduction to  this  question,
it is impossible to ensure that the reseller  has  effectively  deleted  all
existing copies of the work  he/she  decides  to  resell  (copies  could  be
deleted from the reseller’s main computer, but what  is  to  prove  that  he
does not have other copies on other computers/media/devices, or on  a  cloud
server?). Even if technological measures could  be  implemented  to  control
the effective deletion of the original (which  we  doubt  is  possible),  we
know that consumers will oppose such measures, as they have done with  other
technical protection measures in the past.


- As implied by the introductory paragraph to this question,  can  a  market
really be called ‘second-hand’ if the quality of the copy is as good as  the
quality  of  the  original?  This  would  effectively   amount   to   unfair
competition for original works.


- If this ‘second-hand’ market for digital copies were allowed,  this  would
automatically reduce the overall number of sales of originals,  which  would
in turn mean prices for original works would rise.

Any exception or limitation has to comply  with  the  so-called  'three-step
test', which was first mentioned in  relation  to  the  exclusive  right  of
reproduction in the Berne Convention for  the  Protection  of  Literary  and
Artistic Works as revised in 1967, and has since been  embodied  in  several
international treaties. Today, the three-step test is  notably  included  in
the WIPO Copyright Treaty, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms  Treaty  and
the EU  Copyright  Directive.  The  test  sets  limits  to  limitations  and
exceptions on exclusive rights and allows such limitations and exceptions: 
   1. In certain special cases; 
   2. That do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work; and 
3. That do not  unreasonably  prejudice  the  legitimate  interests  of  the
author/rightholder.

The application of the exhaustion doctrine to  either  the  reproduction  or
the making available rights is unlikely to be considered  a  ‘special  case’
(first step). Even if it was considered a ‘special case’,  the  second  step
would not be complied with as the resale  of  previously  purchased  digital
content would obviously conflict with the normal exploitation of the work.


US service ReDigi, which  brands  itself  as  the  world’s  first  pre-owned
digital marketplace, was the subject of a US court ruling[1] in March  2013.
In his conclusions, Judge O’Sullivan wrote:   “In  sum,  ReDigi  facilitates
and profits from the sale of copyrighted commercial recordings,  transferred
in their entirety, with a likely detrimental impact on  the  primary  market
for these goods.” His conclusions were based on the  following  observation:
“ReDigi stresses that it ‘migrates’ a file from a  user’s  computer  to  its
Cloud Locker, so that the same file is transferred to the ReDigi server  and
no copying occurs. However, even if that were the  case,  the  fact  that  a
file has moved from one material object – the user’s computer –  to  another
– the ReDigi server – means that a reproduction is  created.  It  is  beside
the point that the original phonorecord no longer exists.  It  matters  only
that a new phonorecord has been created”.

























C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

( YES

We  welcome  industry-led  solutions  with  neutral  management  and  proper
representation of all categories of right holders. These types of  solutions
can certainly help in the identification and licensing of  works.  It  would
be even more helpful if systems were global  and  not  simply  European.  In
music for example, a global track-based database  should  be  top  priority,
with neutral management and equal treatment for all (majors and music  SMEs)
in  terms  of  approval   of   database   build/functionality,   membership,
management fees, access to data and participation  in  earnings.  Ultimately
the music industry should aim for a structure with a single  global  society
with strong local offices and a single database.


In the case of global repertoire database projects such as the  GRD,  it  is
important to have proper representation for all rightholders.





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


The main advantages would be the re-aggregation of  repertoire  through  the
availability of one main source of authoritative data on identification  and
licensing of works.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


The challenge is to provide services and rightholders access to the widest
possible database of works, and not at the expense of smaller/local
repertoire.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


Being able to better identify rightholders, especially in the case of  music
SMEs that do not have  offices  in  each  country  (unlike  multinationals),
would mean getting better service from the  collecting  societies,  some  of
which  still  have  serious  problems  with  unidentified   repertoire   and
outstanding royalties (in some cases amounting to millions  of  euros).  The
incentive for SMEs to  register  their  works  in  a  European  (or  global)
centralized registry would be the possibility of receiving  higher  revenue,
especially from overseas.


D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


We welcome ongoing initiatives such as global repertoire  database  projects
(such as the GRD). We believe that the  EU  should  actively  support  these
initiatives.


Regarding the registration for music tracks, we believe ISRC codes  must  be
the common sufficient standard for tracks  registration  in  all  collecting
societies. Societies should refuse multiple ISRC registrations for the  same
track and they should pay registered ISRC owners only.



   Term of protection – is it appropriate?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

( YES

First, we would argue that the fact that  the  environment  is  physical  or
digital  should  not  make  any  difference  to  the  length  of   copyright
protection terms. The ‘environment’ is not relevant here.


As regards music recordings, the term of copyright protection  was  extended
by a 2011 Directive from 50 to 70 years.


Although not ideal, this extension from 50 to 70 years has allowed to  close
part of the gap between the EU and  US  term  of  copyright  protection  for
sound recordings. The term of protection for sound recordings in the  US  is
95 years. To unlock the full potential of  Europe’s  cultural  and  creative
industries, they must benefit from the best  conditions.  If  anything,  the
term of copyright for sound recordings  should  be  extended,  or  at  least
retained at 70 years.


An adequate term of protection is particularly important  for  national  and
local artists and specialist genres, which  typically  depend  on  a  longer
“shelf life”. This is crucial  to  stimulate  national  and  local  cultural
economies, and promote investment in  local  creativity  and  identity.  The
existing disparity on the copyright term  protection  for  music  recordings
provides an incentive for  companies  to  invest  in  American  rather  than
European music.


Adequate copyright terms are of particular  importance  for  performers  and
also for the thousands of micro, small and medium sized music labels,  which
produce 80% of all new music release in Europe. A proper term  of  copyright
for  sound  recordings  simultaneously   guarantees   fair   treatment   for
performers and promote  music  companies’  re-investment  in  the  cycle  of
creation to  ensure  the  continuous  development  of  new  talent  and  the
production of new works in Europe.


























 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market




  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

( NO

We do not believe the optional character of limitations and  exceptions  has
caused material issues in practice.  The  main  exceptions  are  already  in
place in most Member  States.  The  list  of  exceptions  in  the  Copyright
Directive is flexible, and rightholders tend to adopt a  pragmatic  approach
to licensing that accommodates new uses (see for example response  on  user-
generated content, question 58).




  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

( NO

We do not believe there is a case for making exceptions  mandatory,  as  the
main exceptions are already in place in most Member States,  and  many  have
no cross-border impact.  If  there  are  calls  for  more  harmonisation  of
exceptions and limitations, we believe it would  be  acceptable  to  clarify
but not to make exceptions  mandatory.  We  would  specifically  oppose  any
‘open-ended’ exceptions similar to the so-called ‘fair use’ doctrine in  the
US which puts rightholders in a difficult situation vis-à-vis certain  uses.
Indeed, open-ended exceptions and limitations create more legal  uncertainty
for right holders, which invariably translates into less revenues.


The list of exceptions in the Copyright Directive should be kept as  it  is.
The Copyright Directive is flexible enough, and rightholders tend  to  adopt
a pragmatic approach to  licensing  that  accommodates  new  uses  (see  for
example our response on user-generated content, question 58). 


Making exceptions mandatory would make copyright less, not  more,  flexible.
The balance achieved by the Copyright Directive would be lost.





  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

( NO

The catalogue of limitations and exceptions included  in  EU  law  is  wide-
ranging. The list of possible exceptions and limitations is  already  there,
even if they are not implemented similarly everywhere. We believe there  are
therefore no reasons to introduce or remove any  exceptions  or  limitations
from the existing ‘catalogue’.


The main exceptions are already in place in most  Member  States,  and  many
have no cross-border  impact.  The  list  of  exceptions  in  the  Copyright
Directive should be kept as it  is.  The  Copyright  Directive  is  flexible
enough, and rightholders tend to adopt a  pragmatic  approach  to  licensing
that accommodates new uses  (see  for  example  response  on  user-generated
content, question 58). 

Any exception or limitation has to comply  with  the  so-called  'three-step
test', which was first mentioned in  relation  to  the  exclusive  right  of
reproduction in the Berne Convention for  the  Protection  of  Literary  and
Artistic Works as revised in 1967, and has since been  embodied  in  several
international treaties. Today, the three-step test is  notably  included  in
the WIPO Copyright Treaty, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms  Treaty  and
the EU  Copyright  Directive.  The  test  sets  limits  to  limitations  and
exceptions on exclusive rights and allows such limitations and exceptions: 
1. In certain special cases; 
2. That do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work; and 
3. That do not  unreasonably  prejudice  the  legitimate  interests  of  the
author/rightholder.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

( NO

The catalogue of limitations and exceptions included  in  EU  law  is  wide-
ranging. The list of possible exceptions and limitations is  already  there,
even if they are not implemented similarly everywhere.


The EU copyright Acquis provides enough flexibility through its list of non-
mandatory exceptions and through the interpretation by the Court of  Justice
of the EU and national courts.


We believe there are therefore no reasons to provide for  a  greater  degree
of flexibility in the EU framework for limitations and exceptions.


The main exceptions are already in place in most  Member  States,  and  many
have no cross-border  impact.  The  list  of  exceptions  in  the  Copyright
Directive should be kept as it  is.  The  Copyright  Directive  is  flexible
enough, and rightholders tend to adopt a  pragmatic  approach  to  licensing
that accommodates new uses (see for example our response  on  user-generated
content). 


As mentioned in our response to question 22, we  would  specifically  oppose
any ‘open-ended’ exceptions similar to the so-called ‘fair use’ doctrine  in
the US, which puts rightholders in a difficult situation  vis-à-vis  certain
uses. Indeed,  open-ended  exceptions  and  limitations  create  more  legal
uncertainty  for  right  holders,  which  invariably  translates  into  less
revenues.


On a separate note, in order to address  efficiently  the  facilitation  and
encouragement of mass  distribution  of  illegal  content,  we  believe  the
liability  exemptions  provisions  for  online  host  providers  should   be
reviewed, to remove certain services’  ability  to  make  copyrighted  works
available without a licence (see our response to question  76  for  more  on
this point).






25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by  the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its  possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

As mentioned in our response to question 22, we  would  specifically  oppose
any ‘open-ended’ exceptions similar to the so-called ‘fair use’ doctrine  in
the US, which puts rightholders in a difficult situation  vis-à-vis  certain
uses. Indeed,  open-ended  exceptions  and  limitations  create  more  legal
uncertainty  for  right  holders,  which  invariably  translates  into  less
revenues.


We believe the EU copyright Acquis provides enough flexibility  through  its
list of non-mandatory exceptions  and  through  the  interpretation  by  the
Court of Justice of the EU and national courts.


26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

( NO

We believe  there  is  no  case  for  changing  the  territorial  nature  of
copyright. The main exceptions are already in place in most  Member  States,
and many have no cross-border impact.


The list of exceptions in the Copyright Directive should be kept as  it  is.
The Copyright Directive is a flexible instrument, and rightholders  tend  to
adopt a pragmatic approach to licensing that accommodates new uses (see  for
example our response on user-generated content, question 58). 





Access to content in libraries and archives



28. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

( NO

Care needs to be taken to make sure this exception does not cannibalise  the
business model of new online services.


37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We do not believe there are any problems. Nothing  seems  to  indicate  that
the EU Copyright Acquis could not accommodate the development of  e-lending.



An exception for e-lending is not necessary for  musical  works.  All  works
are available online.  Introducing  an  exception  for  e-lending  of  music
recordings would  amount  to  unfair  competition  for  legal  online  music
services. Libraries should not be in competition with  commercial  services.
Contractual  arrangements  between  rightholders  and  libraries  should  be
encouraged.

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do  you  see
between libraries’ traditional activities such as  on-premises  consultation
or public  lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?


An exception for e-lending is not necessary for  musical  works.  All  works
are available online.  Introducing  an  exception  for  e-lending  of  music
recordings would  amount  to  unfair  competition  for  legal  online  music
services,  which  is  obviously  not  the  case  of  libraries’  traditional
activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending.



Teaching


42. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

( NO


44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

As we can see from examples mentioned in footnote  44  of  the  consultation
document, some countries are already working on such initiatives.


Research


47. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

( NO



Disabilities


50. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

( NO







Text and data mining

53. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

( NO

The Copyright Directive already provides  for  exceptions  for  research  as
well as for certain temporary copies, which allows for  some  non-commercial
data-mining.

We would oppose the introduction of an exception  for  commercial  text  and
data mining, which would clearly go against licensing schemes  developed  by
publishers. There is a very high risk that such an exception would  be  used
by certain commercial interests and by structurally infringing  websites  to
further shield themselves from liability.



User-generated content


58. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?

( NO


Our members license every  platform  coming  to  them,  if  the  deals  make
commercial sense. It is in our members’  interest  to  have  their  artists’
music as widely available and disseminated as possible. The music sector  is
at the  forefront  of  licensing,  with  over  260  licensed  digital  music
services and 30 millions licensed songs available across Europe.


When it comes to  so-called  user-generated  content,  our  members  license
platforms on which such content is uploaded  –  this  content  is  therefore
licensed  through  the  platform,  licences  are  not  required   for   each
individual  user.  By  licensing  platforms,  the  dissemination  of   user-
generated content is covered.


On such platforms, we are not aware of problems regarding the  use  of  pre-
existing works. This method works and it is only a  matter  of  time  before
more business models accommodate user-generated content  through  a  similar
system.


Similarly, regarding small-scale uses,  users  can  generally  upload  their
videos to online platforms and then embed them on their own  websites/blogs,
ensuring that the video is covered  by  a  licence.  While  the  video  will
appear as being a standalone video on the  user’s  website/blog,  it  is  in
fact a video uploaded to a UGC platform and  subsequently  embedded  on  the
user’s website/blog.


To summarise, licences enable user-generated content to  be  made  available
on platforms and users’ own websites/blogs.


In the context of the second working group of Licences for Europe, on ‘user-
generated  content  and  licensing  for  small-scale   uses   of   protected
material’, record companies and authors’ societies pledged to  offer  multi-
territory ‘one-click  micro-licences’  for  small-scale  use  of  background
music on websites.





59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing  works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?

( NO


62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements?  Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?


No legislative solution is needed.  Rightholders  are  able  to  accommodate
user-generated content through licensing (see response to question 58).





  IV. Private copying and reprography




64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
application of  the  private  copying  and  reprography  exceptions  in  the
digital environment?

( NO

No, there is no need to clarify at EU level the  scope  and  application  of
the private copying exception specifically for the digital environment.  The
scope and application of the private copying should  be  the  same  for  the
offline and online environment.


We believe that the private copying  system  is  virtuous  and  strikes  the
right balance between the ability for consumers to make private  copies  and
the  compensation  of  right  holders.  Private   copying   provides   vital
compensation for creators and those who  invest  in  creation  for  uses  of
their works over which they have no control.


While the methodology and administration of private copying systems is  open
to improvement,  especially  in  terms  of  harmonisation,  IMPALA  strongly
believes that compensation on blank media and  recording  equipment  is  the
fairest way to implement such an exception to copyright  while  compensating
right holders appropriately.


Given the importance to consumers of being able to  copy  their  music  from
one media or device to another, and  given  the  scale  of  private  copying
taking place, we believe it is crucial  for  all  EU  Member  States  to  i)
introduce an exception for private copying with a fair  compensation  scheme
for right holders, and  ii)  regularly  update  the  list  of  media/devices
eligible for private copying compensation. This would greatly contribute  to
tackling the issue of disparate levy systems across  the  EU.  We  therefore
call on the EU to provide clarity on  which  devices  and  media  should  be
levied, and on the principle that no exception for private  copying  can  be
introduced without compensation.


The current private copying system should  be  maintained  and  improved  to
minimise  existing  differences  between  member  states.  It  benefits  all
stakeholders: consumers get to make private copies of works  without  asking
right holders for authorisation, an entire market based on  private  copying
benefits manufacturers/importers/retailers of recording  devices  and  blank
media, and creators and  right  holders  receive  compensation  for  private
copies of their works.


65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and  where  the
harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

( YES


While rightholders are able to license certain copies and  get  remuneration
for them, there continues to be large amounts of private copying outside  of
licensed services because it is not possible to control  these  copies.  The
re-introduction of technological protection  measures  such  as  DRM,  which
consumers have massively  rejected  in  the  past,  is  not  an  option  for
rightholders, especially in the  music  field.  In  addition,  national  law
restricts the possibility to license private uses in some  countries.  As  a
result,  private  copying  remuneration  continues  to  be  an   appropriate
mechanism to compensate right holders for the private copies that are  made.



The reality is that private copying and licensing sit side  by  side.  There
are quite simply limits to the  amount  and  types  of  copying  that  music
producers and other right holders can reasonably license. As a  result,  the
music sector will continue to have to rely on private  copying  remuneration
for private copies that keep being made outside of the licences  given,  for
both physical and digital sales.


There would be a significant risk to not subject ‘copies made by  end  users
for private purposes in the context of the service that  has  been  licensed
by rightholders’ to private copying remuneration.


Regarding the notion of harm, more consistency should also  be  sought  with
regard to the process of setting compensation for private  copying,  notably
by agreeing on a common definition of ‘harm’ uniformly  across  the  EU  and
simplifying the procedural framework  in  which  compensation  is  set.  The
definition of  ‘harm’  suggested  by  Antonio  Vitorino,  appointed  by  the
European Commission to oversee a mediation process on private  copying,   in
his 2013 recommendations as the “missed  licensing  opportunities”  for  the
rightholders due to private copying is the right definition to adopt.


The notion of  ‘minimal  harm’  is  misleading.  An  exception  for  private
copying exception with no corresponding remuneration for creators and  right
holders  would  be  in  direct  breach  of  EU  law.  The  payment  of  fair
compensation for copyright holders  is  an  essential  requirement  for  the
legitimacy of the implementation of private copying exceptions and  national
jurisdictions. Fair compensation is mandated by EU law  (Article  5(2)b  and
Recital 35,  Directive  2001/29/EC)  and  its  indispensable  character  was
acknowledged by the Court of Justice of the European  Union  (CJEU)  in  the
Padawan case, point 44: “Copying by natural  persons  acting  in  a  private
capacity must be regarded as an act likely to cause harm to  the  author  of
the work concerned”. Such an exception would sever the link between the  act
of making private copies and the payment of remuneration to  right  holders,
in contradiction with EU law and case-law, according to which it is for  the
natural persons benefitting from the exception to finally  compensate  right
holders for the private use made of their  works.  In  his  recommendations,
presented in January 2013, Antonio Vitorino confirmed that the link  between
the persons causing the harm and benefitting  from  the  exception  and  the
persons financing a system of fair compensation should not be severed.


Regarding the move from ‘ownership of’ to ‘access to’ works (e.g. move  from
‘download’ to ‘streaming’), we welcome new models whilst  also  noting  that
the reality is that the consumption of music is likely to remain  a  mix  of
ownership and access, where private copying will  still  be  relevant.  This
should simply be taken into account  in  consumer  surveys  to  reflect  the
relative importance of each music consumption model.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud  computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new  business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
revenue on the other?

Regarding cloud-based music services, we share Antonio Vitorino’s view  that
the right holders should, as a priority, be able  to  license  their  rights
and that, for the rest, private copying remuneration is a legitimate way  to
compensate right holders for the  copies  made  of  their  work  by  private
individuals. The reality is that private copying and licensing sit  side  by
side. There are for example quite simply limits to the amount and  types  of
copying  that  music  producers  and  other  right  holders  can  reasonably
license. For instance,  music  services  have  had  to  largely  stop  using
technological  protection  measures  that  limit  private  copying  due   to
negative consumer reaction. As a result, the music sector will  continue  to
have to rely on private copying levies for  the  private  copies  that  keep
being made outside of the licences given,  for  both  physical  and  digital
sales.


We also agree with Mr. Vitorino that any attempts  by  cloud-based  services
to broaden the interpretation of the private copying exception with  a  view
to bypassing the licensing process should not be supported.




67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?

( YES

Compensation on blank media and recording devices  should  be  made  visible
throughout the supply chain. Applied tariffs should be separately  indicated
on all invoices and contracts throughout  the  supply  chain  and  on  final
consumers’ invoices and/or receipts.


68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy,  or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

( NO

In case of distance sales occurring from one EU  and  EEA  Member  State  to
consumers located in one or several other EU and  EEA  Member  States  where
levies are in effect, the distance seller should  be  held  responsible  for
the payment of the levy applicable by virtue  of  the  law  of  the  country
where such consumer is located.

This point of agreement whereby the distance seller is held responsible  for
payment of private copy levies applicable in the country of  destination  of
goods eligible to such levies has been confirmed in  the  “Opus”  ruling  of
the ECJ (C-467/08).

While the principle according  to  which  double  payment  of  private  copy
levies (both in the country of import and export) cannot take  place  should
be reaffirmed  at  EU  level,  we  do  not  agree  with  Antonio  Vitorino’s
recommended shift of liability to  retailers,  or  with  the  recommendation
that levies in cross-border transaction should be collected  exclusively  in
the member states in which the final customer resides.

Currently levies are  collected  from  importers  or  distributors  in  most
countries, and exemptions are provided in case of  exportation  outside  the
country. Shifting the  liability  for  payment  from  a  limited  number  of
importers and distributors to an almost limitless number of retailers  would
make the collection of levies more cumbersome and more expensive  and  could
give rise to fraud. We think that this suggestion should be studied  further
as  it  could  in  our  view  have  an  overall  negative  effect   on   the
effectiveness of levy collections.

In the event that these recommendations are taken  up,  we  strongly  advise
the European Commission  to  follow  Mr.  Vitorino’s  recommendation  to  i)
oblige manufacturers and importers to  “inform  collecting  societies  about
their transactions that concern  products  subject  to  a  levy”,  ii)  make
“manufacturers and importers liable to pay the  levies  themselves  if  they
are not able to demonstrate to whom goods subject to a private  copying  (…)
levy has been sold”, and iii) oblige retailers “to declare  their  sales  of
products that are subject to a levy periodically to collecting societies”.

One of the reasons given by Mr. Vitorino for proposing a shift of  liability
to retailers and collecting  levies  exclusively  in  the  member  state  of
residence of the customer in cross-border transactions is to have  a  system
“where the obligation to pay the levy is limited to entities that sell to  a
natural person as a private user”. We believe this opinion  is  based  on  a
wrong interpretation of the CJEU’s Padawan ruling (see  more  below  in  our
response to question 69).

Mr. Vitorino himself admits that “such a shift (of liability)  would  entail
drastic changes to the system”, and that “the simplification of  the  system
by the reduction of the number of applicable  tariffs  to  only  few  rates”
should be “a prerequisite for the liability shift”. Given the  time  it  may
take to reduce and simplify the number of levy tariffs and  “reorganise  the
entire system of collection”, he therefore proposes another approach,  which
forms an alternative recommendation  to  the  liability  shift:  introducing
uniform rules for ex ante exemption for those manufacturers and importers.

Based on our understanding of the Padawan ruling  (see  more  below  in  our
response to question 69), we would recommend that  an  alternative  approach
be implemented, instead of the shift of liability of  retailers,  in  a  way
which excludes professional uses (and not professional users)  from  private
copying compensation scheme. For example this could be done either:
-  By  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  a  given  percentage  of  the
media/device is not used for  purely  private  purposes  but  also  used  by
companies, public administrations, etc. for their  professional  activities,
in  integrating  such  uses  in  the  calculation  of   the   private   copy
remuneration tariffs through a rebate corresponding to said percentage  (so-
called “mutualised system”); or
-  By  implementing  exoneration  and/or  reimbursement  schemes  for  those
entities which clearly use devices/media exclusively for their  professional
activities.


69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to  persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private  copying?  Do
any of those transactions  result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example you provide  (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).

Independent  music  companies  always  recognised  that  copies   made   for
professional purposes should be excluded from the private copying  exception
and therefore should not be levied.

We  strongly  disagree  with  EC-appointed   Mediator   Antonio   Vitorino’s
proposal, in his 2013 recommendations on the subject, that  private  copying
levies should not apply to goods sold to “professional” users. The Court  of
Justice of the  EU  clarified  in  the  so-called  “Padawan”  decision  that
private copying levies must not be applied in the case of uses unrelated  to
private copying, such as professional uses. In contrast  to  the  Mediator’s
recommendation, we believe that the exemption from  the  obligation  to  pay
the private copying levy should be based on the use  made  of  a  particular
media or device, and not on the nature of the user. This  assessment  should
be made on the basis of consumer studies/surveys rather than be left to  the
retailers’ discretion.

While the Court of Justice of the  European  Union  clarified  that  private
copying levies must not be imposed on goods acquired for purposes  unrelated
to private copying, devices acquired by professional users can also be  used
for private copies of works for uses unrelated to  the  professional  nature
of the device. The exemption from the obligation to pay the private  copying
levy should therefore be based on the use made of the media or  device,  and
not on the nature of the user.

In case C-467/08 Padawan vs SGAE, the CJEU ruled on 21 October 2010 that:
“Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that  a
link is necessary between the application of the levy  intended  to  finance
fair compensation with respect to digital  reproduction  equipment,  devices
and media and the deemed use of them for the purposes  of  private  copying.
Consequently, the indiscriminate application of the  private  copying  levy,
in particular with respect to digital reproduction  equipment,  devices  and
media not made available to private users  and  clearly  reserved  for  uses
other than private copying, is incompatible with Directive 2001/29”.

It is wrong to conclude that private copying  levies  should  not  apply  to
goods sold  to  non-private  users.  Indeed,  as  mentioned  above,  devices
acquired by professional users for the professional activities can  and  are
used to make copies of works for private use.  The  result  of  the  Padawan
ruling is that private copying levies should not apply to goods sold to non-
private users when these  are  exclusively  reserved  for  uses  other  than
private copying.

As  already  mentioned  in  our  response  to  question  68,  based  on  our
understanding of the Padawan ruling, we would recommend that an  alternative
approach be implemented, instead of the shift of liability of retailers,  in
a way which excludes professional uses (and  not  professional  users)  from
private copying compensation scheme. For example this could be done  either:

-  By  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  a  given  percentage  of  the
media/device is not used for  purely  private  purposes  but  also  used  by
companies, public administrations, etc. for their  professional  activities,
in  integrating  such  uses  in  the  calculation  of   the   private   copy
remuneration tariffs through a rebate corresponding to said percentage  (so-
called “mutualised system”); or
-  By  implementing  exoneration  and/or  reimbursement  schemes  for  those
entities which clearly use devices/media exclusively for their  professional
activities.


70. Where such undue payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions   and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member  States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?

As already mentioned in our response  to  questions  68  and  69,  we  would
indeed recommend implementing exoneration and/or reimbursement  schemes  for
those  entities  which  clearly  use  devices/media  exclusively  for  their
professional activities.


71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


The Spanish government has introduced a new compensation system for  private
copying which replaces the former system with a State  fund.  The  immediate
effect is that the compensation has been reduced more  than  20  fold  (from
over €115 million to €5 million). Such a reduction is already having a  huge
impact on the cultural sector: activities  such  as  festivals,  new  talent
training, promotion of the cultural  industries  or  medical  insurance  for
creators and artists are receiving €22 million less per year.

We strongly call on other Member States not to follow this  example,  as  it
makes all taxpayers contribute irrespective of whether they have engaged  in
private copying or not, thus cutting the link between  the  act  of  private
copying and the payment of fair compensation due to rights holders.

As a consequence creators, artists and producers  will  hardly  receive  any
remuneration for the private copies  made  of  their  works,  as  this  will
ultimately depend on the availability of funds coming from  the  government.
Despite the phase-out  of  the  compensation,  the  prices  of  devices  and
recordable media are being maintained at the current level, with no  savings
passed onto the consumers who make private copies.

Many rightholder  organisations  lodged  a  complaint  against  the  Spanish
government. The European Commission’s decision is still pending. However  in
order to redress the situation in  Spain  urgent  action  is  needed  at  EU
level, which is why we call for an infringement procedure against Spain.

The UK is  planning  to  introduce  a  private  copying  exception  with  no
corresponding compensation for creators and those who  invest  in  creation.
This is a direct breach of EU law, as the payment of  fair  compensation  to
copyright holders is an essential requirement  for  the  legitimacy  of  the
implementation of private copying exceptions in national  jurisdictions.  As
in Spain, the proposed changes would sever  the  link  between  the  act  of
making private copies and the payment of compensation to right holders.




   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers




72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

To put this question into context, we have to understand how performers  are
remunerated.

Certain  forms  of  exploitation,  for   example   performance,   broadcast,
communication to the public, give rise to equitable  remuneration  for  both
producers and performers. This is generally for secondary  exploitation  and
these rights are  generally  negotiated  jointly.  Primary  exploitation  is
subject to exclusive rights and dealt with  by  contract.  This  covers  for
example physical sales and online  sales  such  as  downloads,  as  well  as
interactive uses such as interactive streaming  falling  within  the  making
available right.

In the music sector, there is a balance between the  different  rightholders
according to their contributions to  the  creative  process.  Producers  and
artists/performers sign  contracts  following  negotiations  to  ensure  the
remuneration of both parties.  In  practice,  this  situation  reflects  the
creative contribution of the  performers  and  the  financial  and  material
contribution of producers who take the risk in  investing  in  the  artist’s
projects, as well as the risk of course of featured  artists  themselves  in
their own project.

For featured artists, many different types of contract  exist,  e.g.  profit
share  once  all  costs  are  recovered,   percentage   of   revenue   deals
irrespective of whether costs are recovered, etc.

For unfeatured or session performers, unions negotiate standard terms  which
generally involve hourly rates and lump sum buy-outs.

We understand that one question is whether or not performers should have  an
additional right to equitable remuneration for exploitation  falling  within
the making available right such as interactive streaming, which  is  another
form of primary  exploitation  falling  under  exclusive  rights  as  it  is
equivalent to or replacing sales  or  downloads.  We  also  understand  that
certain claims are made that performers are not  remunerated  for  downloads
or other interactive uses.

In fact performers are paid for downloads and interactive streaming  in  the
same way as for other forms of sale or primary exploitation under  exclusive
rights – via terms negotiated by unions  if  they  are  a  session  or  non-
featured performer, via their contract with  the  producer  if  they  are  a
featured artist signed to a label.

The  current  system  offers  a  mix  of  exclusive  rights  and   equitable
remuneration which applies according to the type of exploitation.

The licensing system is already quite complex, and we believe an  additional
right would  create  more  complication  in  licensing  practices.  However,
beyond that, it is about the economics of the sector.

We fully support proper remuneration for all  artists  and  performers.  Our
members pride themselves  on  their  track  record  in  dealing  with  these
issues. Where there is a true partnership between those involved and  taking
risks in the creative project, this is reflected in the terms.  The  current
approach gives flexibility to agree terms for  core  business  according  to
the circumstances and we do not think that this balance should be changed.


73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

( NO





  VI. Respect for rights


75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

( YES


The ability to enforce rights through the courts is of vital  importance  to
record companies. The quality of civil enforcement systems for  Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) is very relevant –  strong  enforcement  of  IPRs  in
Europe will allow more legitimate services to develop, stop  the  widespread
economic harm caused by the massive infringement of protected  content,  and
simultaneously help the  market  develop.  The  livelihood  of  music  SMEs,
artists and many other actors in the music sector depend on this.


Civil  enforcement  systems  allow  right  holders  to  ask  for   permanent
injunctions against the copyright infringer.


Without strong  enforcement  of  IPR,  revenues  will  keep  decreasing  and
therefore have a  direct  impact  on  artists’  signing  by  record  labels.
Investment by record companies in so-called “A&R” (‘artist and  repertoire’)
is directly linked to their ability to produce a revenue from the  IPR  they
hold.


With regard to enforcement, the biggest challenge faced by music  SMEs  (99%
of music companies are  SMEs)  is  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources
necessary to monitor all platforms/shops where unauthorised copies of  their
works might be available. This lack of resources is also what keeps  a  vast
majority of music SMEs from litigating against infringements of  their  IPR.
Litigation is usually too long and costly, with a very uncertain  end-result
(ruling and compensation).


We believe civil redress channels should be made more accessible.  Helpdesks
should also be introduced  for  individual  creators  and  SMEs  faced  with
enforcement challenges. The predictability in civil redress should  also  be
improved, notably  by  clarifying  the  principle  for  estimating  damages,
calculating costs and defining ‘commercial scale’ more precisely.


SMEs also need to be able to rely on collective litigation, as some of  them
already do through Merlin, a global  rights  agency  for  independent  music
companies which serves as a one-stop-shop for online  licences.  Merlin  has
taken part in litigation in  enforcement  cases  on  behalf  of  independent
music companies.


It is obviously more of a priority for right holders to  stop  infringements
carried out on a large scale and committed for profit, but the  availability
of infringing material even on a small scale and committed  not  for  profit
is also a real  problem.  The  availability  to  consumers  of  structurally
infringing  websites  gives  them  the  impression  that   infringement   of
copyright is not illegal.


Enforcement should focus primarily on services set up for the  sole  purpose
of making a profit from infringing content. Enforcement should  nevertheless
also tackle small-scale infringements committed not-for-profit,  as  results
have shown that consumers tend to turn to legal services once  they  realise
that they might be held  accountable  for  IPR  infringement.  Although  not
directly comparable, French agency HADOPI (Haute Autorité pour la  Diffusion
des Oeuvres et la Protections des droits sur Internet) published a study  in
2012 which showed a 20-25% increase in digital music sales in  France  since
the  introduction  of  HADOPI,  the  French  agency  created  to   encourage
compliance with copyright. These figures demonstrate that warning  users  of
possible sanctions encourages them to turn to legal services.


In the commercial vs non-commercial debate, it is interesting to  note  that
IPR infringement, even on a tiny  scale,  are  rarely  100%  non-commercial.
Indeed, the moment a work is uploaded on a platform  without  the  copyright
owners’ consent, and sits next to  advertisement,  the  platform  owner  and
possibly the uploader both start reaping  financial  benefits  from  a  work
they have neither created nor financed; effectively somebody else’s work.


It  should  be  possible  to  pursue   the   individuals/businesses   making
commercial   use   of   IPR   infringing   works   through    advertisement,
subscriptions, selling of behavioural  data,  etc.  In  order  for  this  to
happen, the collaboration of ISPs is of  outmost  importance.  In  terms  of
particular consequences, there are a series of measures which can  be  taken
to sanction the infringer (the recently introduced  ‘six-strikes’  copyright
alert system in the US is interesting in this respect).


Damages granted by courts should at a minimum be equal to  damages  incurred
by the rightholder, and should be proportionate to the  infringer’s  profits
when these exceed the actual damage incurred by the right holder.  Potential
infringers will be dissuaded from  engaging  in  illegal  activities  unless
potential  damages  match  or  exceed  potential  enrichment.  We  therefore
suggest putting in place triple damages.


In general, damages awarded in IPR cases should be effective,  proportionate
and dissuasive. Damages awarded by courts have until now  been  too  low  to
effectively   deter   potential   infringement   of   copyrighted   content.
Enforcement would be more efficient if member states were made to  introduce
more effective remedies and deterrents.


76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such   as   Internet   service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

( YES

As mentioned in the  previous  question,  with  regard  to  enforcement  the
biggest challenge faced by SMEs such as our members  is  that  they  do  not
have  the  resources  necessary  to  monitor   all   platforms/shops   where
unauthorised copies of their works might be available.

In light of this huge barrier to effective enforcement of their rights,  our
members call on decision-makers, and at this stage more specifically on  the
European Commission, to review the enforcement Directive in  order  to  make
enforcement more efficient, by recognising that intermediaries have  a  duty
of care –  indeed,  all  intermediaries  have  responsibilities  and  should
exercise all due diligence to stop their customers from carrying out  and/or
aiding large-scale infringement. ‘Due diligence’ should be  better  defined,
as well as ‘commercial scale’.


Law enforcement authorities should also  be  encouraged  to  ‘go  after  the
money’ – behind many sites  offering  infringing  works  are  people  making
money off the creators’ work without investing a penny into  this  work.  It
should be possible to go after the people/businesses making  commercial  use
of these infringing works, through  advertisements,  subscriptions,  selling
of behavioural data, etc. In order for this to happen, the collaboration  of
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is of outmost importance.


The  collaboration  of  ISPs  and  payment  service  providers   should   be
established. For example, it is crucial to create a system  where  ISPs  and
payment providers are required to block consumers’ access  and  payments  to
the sites that have been shown to infringe  copyright.  Intermediaries  such
as ISPs and payment providers are  strategically  placed  between  consumers
and websites  potentially  contributing  to  or  facilitating  infringement.
These intermediaries are in a  favourable  position  to  contribute  to  the
prevention and termination of online infringements,  making  them  essential
actors in the fight against online infringement of IPR.


Liability exemptions for online service providers were initially  introduced
(through the E-Commerce Directive) based on the  assumption  that  the  vast
majority  of  copyright  infringement  online  would  not  be   commercially
motivated, and host providers themselves would not be interested in  hosting
infringing content. However, the  general  exemptions  enabled  commercially
motivated services to abuse this  privilege  and  profit  from  hosting  and
disseminating vast amounts of illegal content under the  protection  granted
by adhering  to  inefficient  notice  and  action  procedures.  The  general
exemption of host  providers  from  liability  for  infringing  third  party
content created a loophole which is being systematically exploited  by  some
operators with commercial intent to  host  masses  of  illegal  content  and
generate profits for themselves, without  remunerating  rightholders.  These
host providers are protected  by  the  removal  of  the  small  fraction  of
illegal content successfully notified to them.


Notice  and  action  procedures  work  only  for  incidental   infringements
associated with legitimate businesses, but  not  for  a  growing  number  of
structurally  infringing  websites  whose   business   is   built   on   the
distribution of illegal content. Notice and action procedures  do  not  work
for SMEs in the creative industries, which do  not  have  the  resources  to
continuously monitor hundreds of platforms hosting  infringing  content  and
thousands of “sharing point” containing links to  these  files.  The  volume
makes  efficient  notice  and  action  procedures  impossible   to   perform
manually, while software-based automated solutions  are  far  too  expensive
for SMEs dependent on the monetisation of their  often-extensive  catalogues
via legal services.


We  therefore  believe  a  review  and  more  precise  definition   of   the
preconditions for exemption from liability is required.  The  definition  of
hosting  (Art.  14  e-commerce  directive)  was  initially  meant  to  cover
‘hosting-only’  providers.   We   believe   only   strictly-speaking   ‘host
providers’ (i.e. only  hosting  in  a  neutral  way)  should  enjoy  general
exemption from liability.


We believe it is now necessary to differentiate between host providers.  The
simple categorisation into service providers,  content  providers  and  host
providers was  appropriate  in  the  1990s  but  is  no  longer  sufficient.
Especially, the category of host providers is so diversified  nowadays  that
the general exemption from liability is no longer justifiable. As  mentioned
above, a closer look at the most damaging  platforms  however  reveals  that
the  business  of  some  of  these  host  providers  is  based  on  actively
encouraging the upload  of  as  much  as  attractive  (illegal)  content  as
possible  and  distributing  it  to  as   many   recipients   as   possible.
Structurally, the business of such host providers is closer to the  function
of  publishers  than  that  that  of  warehouse  keepers.  No  publisher  of
copyrighted  content  is  exempted  from   liability.   Consequently,   such
platforms  must  bear  reasonable  responsibility  for  the   content   they
distribute, especially if they also ensure that  the  uploaders  of  illegal
content remain anonymous: in combination with the high  level  of  anonymity
of uploaders the general  exemption  from  liability  has  created  a  legal
vacuum whereby all parties involved in  copyright  infringement  are  either
exempted from liability or protected by anonymity. A  majority  of  services
unresponsive to notices  also  operate  in  full  anonymity,  in  breach  of
article 5 of the E-Commerce Directive, which obliges  service  providers  to
provide the geographic address at which they are  established.  Rightholders
should hence be able to notify them directly  at  their  address.  Operating
transparently  should  be  a  condition  to  benefit  from   the   liability
exemptions foreseen by the E-Commerce Directive.


The facilitation and encouragement of mass distribution of  illegal  content
must be addressed efficiently. In  our  view,  this  can  only  be  done  by
reviewing  the  exemption  from   liability   for   services   substantially
benefitting from the dissemination of illegal content. In  other  words,  we
think the liability exemptions/safe harbour provisions should be  abolished,
hence  removing  YouTube  and  other  similar  services’   right   to   make
copyrighted works available without a licence.


We encourage the collaboration of online intermediaries and  rights  owners,
and support the development of a system whereby ISPs would  stop  access  to
sites that have  been  shown  to  infringe  copyright  in  another  European
jurisdiction. The Pirate Bay example shows why the current system  does  not
work: while the owners of the site have  been  convicted  in  Sweden,  their
home country, the world’s largest illegal provider  of  copyrighted  content
is still available in many EU countries to  millions  of  users.  The  whole
system needs to be changed so that a court order  can  be  issued  to  close
down an illegal operation at once, instead of dividing it  into  responsible
persons, web domains and hosting service providers.


As indicated above, it is our view that a more  differentiated  approach  to
the preconditions for exemption from liability is  required  to  efficiently
address the existing problems. As long as that has not been implemented,  at
the very least: i) notice and takedown should become ‘notice and stay  down’
(i.e. a host provider should prevent a flagged content from  reappearing  on
its platform, which would prevent future infringement  of  the  same  work),
and new rules should require online intermediaries to  remove  the  notified
file, identical copies of the file, and to prevent re-uploading of the  same
file; and ii) cyberlockers should remove the file  notified,  and  not  just
the link, as in the case of cyberlockers thousands of  links  point  to  one
single file. Removing only one link to the illegal file is useless.


A recent study produced by Google confirmed that  a  substantial  amount  of
internet traffic to pirate sites come from  search  engines  (1/6th  of  the
total). Search engines should also stop listing links  to  pirate  sites  in
their search results, or at least move them down the search results.


There is a great need for  strong  measures  to  enforce  copyright  and  to
support the development of  the  digital  market  across  Europe,  and  more
specifically in countries where the market is not developing correctly.


There are positive signs that the market is going  better  and  that  people
are increasingly ready to pay for cultural works. This is not  the  time  to
be inactive, this is the  time  to  encourage  this  trend  by  giving  more
prominence to licit works,  and  making  sure  all  those  involved  in  the
creative value chain get proper remuneration for their works, which will  in
turn create a virtuous investment cycle.



77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?

( YES

Measures to enforce copyright must find the right balance between data
protection/privacy and the protection of IPRs. Both are recognised as
fundamental rights of the EU.

An effective enforcement of IPRs does  not  mean  that  data  protection  or
privacy rights would be denied. The remedies  proposed  simply  have  to  be
consistent with the need to respect existing fundamental rights.


An enforcement framework placing the emphasis on the collaboration  of  ISPs
could strike the appropriate balance between data protection/privacy  rights
and the protection of IPRs. A collaborative  system  would  imply  a  shared
responsibility higher up the distribution chain, which would  help  to  ‘dry
up’ sources of copyright  infringement  without  affecting  the  privacy  of
internet users.



 VII.    A single EU Copyright Title


78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and  exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

( NO

A single EU copyright title could be an interesting concept as  long  as  it
recognises that doing business in music in  Europe  will  always  require  a
national as well as European approach, with strong national actors.


Establishing a single EU copyright title would be fraught with  difficulties
and we believe the case for this process has not been made.




79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?

( NO

As mentioned in our  response  to  the  previous  question,  establishing  a
single EU copyright title would indeed  be  a  very  long-term  process.  We
believe the priority should be  to  efficiently  enforce  copyright  and  to
create a level playing field for all copyright holders.


VIII.     Other issues


80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal  framework
for copyright? Please explain  and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
addressed.

( YES

The European cultural and creative sectors represent a massive asset the  EU
needs to capitalise on. This is important  for  the  economy,  for  cultural
diversity, and for Europe to stand out internationally through its  cultural
influence. This would  all  be  made  impossible  if  copyright  is  further
weakened. Improve copyright by all means through  initiatives  such  as  the
Orphan Works Directive,  Collective  Rights  Management  Directive,  or  the
mediation on private copying, but tools should not be limited  by  a  review
of the Copyright Directive  and  by  broadening  exceptions.  The  Copyright
Directive was in fact forward-looking when drafted and remains  flexible  to
adapt to the digital economy.


First, we would like  to  recall  that  copyright  and  related  rights  are
granted to ensure that those who have created or invested  in  the  creation
of music, or other content such as literature or films,  can  determine  how
their creation can be used and receive remuneration  for  it.  Copyright  is
both an  incentive  to  create  and  a  reward  for  creativity.  It  is the
fundamental tool for ensuring that creators are fairly  rewarded  for  their
work all along the value chain. Our members,  thousands  of  SMEs,  European
independent music companies, the artists they produce, and all  the  skilled
individuals involved in the process of making music  (composers,  lyricists,
music publishers, performers, backing musicians, sound engineers,  recording
studio staff, artists’ managers, graphic artists, etc.),  rely  directly  or
indirectly on copyright. 


It is in the interests of the  cultural  and  creative  industries  to  have
copyright protected content as widely  available  and  consumed  legally  as
possible across borders. Work is already underway with the  recently  agreed
'Collective  Rights  Management'  Directive   to   facilitate   the   multi-
territorial licensing and wide cross-border availability of works. The  now-
concluded 'Licences for Europe' stakeholder dialogues will  also  help  move
the discussion forward. Lots of efforts have been produced by  the  cultural
and creative sectors to allow new online uses to develop, especially in  the
music sector where hundreds  of  legal  services  are  available  throughout
Europe, some of them covering a big portion of the EU territory. 


The very principle of copyright seems to be  increasingly  challenged  by  a
wide range of voices, from online services to ‘free internet’ activists,  to
telcos and device manufacturers, and even EU officials. We believe  some  of
these attacks are planned and funded by very large interests, with  the  aim
of paying less for music and other creative works, whilst  protecting  their
own copyright and taking rights from smaller creators and the public,  often
without any room left for negotiating payments.  Creators  can’t  match  the
lobbying forces of online operators. We rely on  intelligent  governance  to
take the right decisions. We ask EU decision-makers to remember why  certain
interests are asking for a review  of  the  Copyright  Directive,  for  more
exceptions and for shorter copyright terms. Copyright is an asset we  should
be thinking about strengthening, not weakening.

Copyright is an enabler, or at least it should be. Member States  should  be
making sure Europe does  everything  in  its  power  to  ensure  our  market
liberates Europe's massive potential and avoids  the  trap  of  transferring
our  economic  right  to  trade  to  tech  companies,  many  of   whom   are
not European  and  do  not  appear  to  be  making  the  level   of   fiscal
contribution that exists in our sector.

Here we would like to highlight  one  of  IMPALA’s  members:  Beggars  Group
calculated it paid more corporate tax at  the  full  rate  in  the  UK  than
Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon combined in 2012. In light  of  this,  we
call on the European Commission to pay closer attention to  the  taxes  paid
by online US giants. This practice of not paying  taxes  at  all  or  paying
very  low  taxes  in  member  states  where   services   are   provided   is
unacceptable, and we urge the EU to set up  a  framework  which  makes  fair
taxation a priority. As Commissioner  Semeta  said  when  he  announced  the
creation of a high level expert group on taxation of the digital economy  in
October 2013, it must be ensured that the digital  sector  “plays  fair  and
pays fair”.

As noted by the European Commission in its September 2012  Communication  on
'boosting growth  and  jobs  in  the  cultural  and  creative  sectors,  the
cultural and creative sectors in Europe account for up to 4.5% of  EU’s  GDP
and 8.5 million jobs. They have on average  a  higher  percentage  of  youth
employment,  are  in  a  strategic  position  to   produce   well-documented
spillover effects in other industries, have an  increasing  impact  on  non-
technological  driven  innovation,  produce   high   return   on   strategic
investments, and depend heavily on innovation by SMEs (such as  our  members
who account for over 80% of all new releases in Europe).

Yet, as stressed by the Commission, the EU’s cultural and creative  sectors’
potential is still not fully recognised and remains largely untapped.

It is now critical that Europe's focus is about standing up for these  great
European businesses, most of which are SMEs. The big may or may not  survive
with lower revenues and fewer rights, but the small  will  not,  along  with
national  creativity  and  culture  in  countries  already   de-prioritising
copyright. Europe’s cultural diversity cannot sustain such attacks.

It is fundamental to creators’ freedom to create and earn a living,  without
which only the "fast food  culture"  would  survive  with  all  the  rights,
creativity,  information  and  personal  data  of   our   citizens   already
controlled and monetised with scant regard for sharing the benefits and  for
the freedom of artists and citizens to do things differently. 

How can online businesses  be  allowed  to  grow  by  getting  citizens  and
creators  to  assign  their  rights  in  perpetuity,  while   ignoring   the
fundamental right of creators to earn a living?  How  can  online  operators
divide up the European market using advertising and  other  means?  How  can
European artists' work be more and more  popular  but  earn  less  and  less
money? Why should copyright exceptions, perfectly  justified  for  citizens,
be used for commercial endeavours? Is it right that  those  who  pay  hardly
any tax in Europe have the ear of decision makers?

Copyright is the only currency creators have,  and  an  asset  which  Europe
should be thinking about strengthening. Let us  create  a  Europe  which  is
proud of its creators and wants to make sure they earn  more,  not  less. We
ask three things:

- Take a stance for strong copyright, rather than hitch a ride on the  anti-
copyright train. 

- Remember why certain interests are asking for a review  of  the  Copyright
Directive.

- Last but not least, create  a  framework  around  the  current  system.  A
framework that allows creators to do their job and does not  transfer  their
right to  trade  to  others;  a  framework  that  will  do  something  about
advertising, search results and enforcement; a  framework  that  makes  sure
services have  the  chance  to  develop  the  legitimate  online  market;  a
framework where creators of all sizes are treated fairly; a framework  which
makes fair taxation a priority; a framework  that  reinforces  diversity;  a
framework that builds on the points in our response to Question 7. 

And this is not  just  because  Europe  values  creation  and  culture,  but
because they are  essential.  Cultural  and  creative  sectors  are  part of
Europe's strongest  assets.  They  are among  the  biggest  contributors  to
Europe's economy, they are already the main source of activity  online,  and
will soon become the main source of activity overall. The EU needs  to  take
a strategic approach to maximising its cultural and creative sectors in  the
long run. The benefits for Europe will be extremely  significant,  the  most
obvious being to pull the EU's economy out of its current anemic state. 

We urge the EU to work on a European industrial policy focusing on  Europe's
cultural and creative sectors. This  could  take  the  form  of  a  'package
approach', a multi-layered strategy to fully unlock the potential  of  these
cultural and creative sectors. The idea would be to tackle  the  key  issues
– from access to finance to taxation through copyright and  competition – at
once to develop  a  sustainable  economy  of  diversity  based  on  Europe's
creativity, a source of activity that will never dry up. 

We hope this will be among the EU’s highest priorities for  the  foreseeable
future. The aim, quite simply, should be to make Europe the  best  place  in
the world for creators, which in turn would make Europe the  best  place  to
run a business and the best place to be a citizen.

                                                                        -End
                                                     -----------------------
