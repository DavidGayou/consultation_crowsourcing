                           on the review of the EU copyright rules



Introduction

It is important to remind that today in Europe, satellite is the most widespread infrastructure of delivery
for digital TV, having overtaken other (terrestrial) distribution platforms. Satellite is also the TV
distribution system providing the highest number of TV channels, with the highest degree of
digitalisation, and it is pioneering Ultra HD. Although this consultation addresses content issues,
satellite operators such as SES are essential players in the media distribution chain, and SES
considers copyright as an fundamental regulatory feature in the current business environment.

Most importantly for this consultation, satellite broadcasting provides highly reliable & secure
transmission performances. Remarkable content management, playout and encryption services (on
behalf of our customers who are the content providers) guarantee high standards in media service
availability and format quality.

Q2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in
the EU?

To our knowledge, there is no legal barriers to pan-European distribution of audiovisual content
under the existing regulatory regime. Where there is a commercial and legally sound case for pan-
European distribution of content, multi-territorial licensing can be chosen as appropriate.

Q5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

Q6. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the
consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

It is essential, in Europe, to guarantee a wide range and choice of content on consumers’ TV
screens and the financial viability of those involved in bringing this content to citizens. In today’s
multi-platform, multi-window world, territorial distribution is frequently the optimum way, via exclusivity
and price differentiation, of maximising revenues. Crucially, these revenue then flows back into new
investment in national / local content (e.g. through targeted advertising). National copyright
therefore supports national content production, hence it favours European cultural diversity.

Territoriality as such is not an obstacle for cross-border distribution of audiovisual content; in fact, the
specificity of the audiovisual sector depends precisely on territorial exclusivity and contractual
freedom in relation to the licensing of audiovisual works. Territoriality of copyright has to be
maintained, without preventing the possibility of multi-territoriality.

Q7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?

Media content does cross national frontiers: a huge amount of audiovisual content is being
distributed outside its country of origin/production. For instance, this happens for the redistribution of
TV content where there is a strong enough demand, such as in neighbouring markets with a common
language or cultural affinities (UK/Ireland, Germany/Austria/Switzerland, Scandinavia). As another
example, Hollywood majors already roll out their movies and TV series across all of Europe by
entering into deals in all of the EU Member States, across all possible delivery methods (cinema,
VOD, DVD/Blu-ray, Pay-TV, free-to-air broadcasting) and dubbing/subtitling them according to
national preferences.

Mandating a pan-European approach to the distribution of audio-visual content would risk
undermining the incentives of content producers to invest and innovate in the first place and
ultimately harming the domestic European content industries that reflect plurality in
languages and consumer tastes.

For travellers and expatriates, technology solutions do exist to privately access audiovisual
media services from outside the licensed home territory even though the distribution of such
services is restricted to this territory. One technological solution consists in the use of place-shifting-
receivers (e.g. the slim box), whereby a consumer accesses the audiovisual content available in
his/her home country from abroad (at a distance) and initiates the forward transmission from the
home receiver to his current location.

Q75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

It is a fact that online piracy continues to be a problem for Europe’s content industries. A robust
approach to copyright enforcement is needed, both within the EU Single market and towards third
countries, through the relevant international institutions, including the Council of Europe and the
World Intellectual Property Organisation.

Online primary transmissions need to have recourse to technical means of protection that are
equivalent to encryption for satellite transmissions.

The same fundamental principle of contractual freedom should be preserved for online distribution
of audiovisual works as for TV broadcasting.
