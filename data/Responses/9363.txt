             ISPA COMMENT ON THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE REVIEW OF THE EU
             COPYRIGHT RULES


             Dear Sir/Madame,

             ISPA (Internet Service Providers Austria; Identification Number: 56028372438-43) is pleased that
             the European Commission has issued this public consultation on the review of the EU copyright
             rules.

             ISPA would like to emphasize that it is very pleased that the aim of the public consultation lies in
             adapting the EU copyright regulatory framework to meet the challenges of the digital reality. ISPA
             is convinced that the current European copyright legislation needs to be revised in order to improve
             and harmonise rights management and to adapt them to the development of the Information
             Society. ISPA supports the harmonisation of IPR for digital content; the fragmentation needs to be
             solved.

             The limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives in ISPA’s opinion lack the
             flexibility to adapt to the changes occurring in a rapidly evolving online environment and therefore
             need to be revised. The terms of copyright protection should be also adjusted to the digital
             environment. ISPA stresses that the civil enforcement system for infringements of copyright with a
             commercial purpose in the EU should be revised in the context of the IPRED and the E-Commerce
             directive and not separately in the Information Society Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC). ISPA
             would like to point out that in its opinion the provision of hyperlinks and the viewing of a web page
             should not be a subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. Digital copies made by end users for
             private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders should not be
             subject to private copying levies, as this would create a situation of double payment. ISPA
             furthermore suggests that levies should be made visible on the invoices of such products.

                  1. The territorial fragmentation of rights should not apply for digital content

             Question: 1. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in
             the EU? and

             Question: 7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
             solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
             Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

             Despite the fact that there are no legislative obstacles preventing or prohibiting the provision of
             cross-border digital services and the development of a unique continental market for online
             content, the commercial practices actually put in place by rights-holders have the result or the
             scope to create a pervasive territorial fragmentation. This has very much to do with the fact that
             online rights are still managed in many cases in bundle with other forms of distribution
             (broadcasting for instance) for which the territorial dimension still makes more sense that the
             European one.

             Licensing of content by right holders (major studios, independent producers, and broadcasters) is,
             in fact, still managed at national level based on the concept of the territorial exclusivity. This means
             that in acquiring the content in a given country, for instance, a video on demand (VOD) operator
             can only make the content available in that given country and has to put in place DRM measures
             (geo-filtering of IP addresses) to prevent EU citizens living in different countries from acquiring that
             content. A provider willing to put together a cross-national EU VOD service, would then need – for
             each content item in the library - to negotiate and sign a specific contract in each specific territory.

             The territory-by-territory acquisition of rights does not entail simply having different libraries for
             each territory, but also different economic conditions, retail prices, availability dates, usage
             limitations, as again the condition at which the right is negotiated depends by the local branch
             dealing with it. This creates another important barrier to the establishment of a pan European
             digital service, as the usage condition and billing models of the content may vary from country to
             country.

             Beside the above issues, the impact of the collective right management system on the digital single
             market is also relevant, creating additional complexities. In practice, even when rights are acquired
             by on-line platform operators for each country, a further territory-by-territory clearance has to be
             gained through the national based Collective Management Organizations (CMOs) each with a
             different spread of (national) rights holders. The relevance in this context of the restrictive
             behaviour of collecting societies was confirmed by the European Commission in the antitrust
             decision of 2008.

             As a result, under the current system, most digital content that could easily be distributed through
             an online platform for the entire continent’s consumption may then be subject to several deals and
             to clearance 28 times through at least 28 different Collective Management Organizations, not
             taking into account a large number of mayors and independent labels in many cases not
             represented by CMOs. All such deals involve significant transaction costs and potential restrictions
             dramatically hampering the roll-out of start-ups and cross-border services. This frustrates and

             brakes innovative and competitive players which, in the absence of the above obstacles, could
             easily develop online content offers with continental reach, thanks to the capability of the Internet
             protocol and the wide presence of broadband and high-speed connections.

             Therefore at ISPA’s opinion, a comprehensive review of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright in the
             Information Society would be needed along with clear measures specifically aimed at ending the
             current restrictive licensing practices.



                  2. The provision of a hyperlink should not be a subject to the authorisation of the
                     rightholder

             Question: 11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
             protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
             authorisation of the rightholder?

             A hyperlink is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow to find an already available
             content. Their function is to link any information to any other information over the Internet;
             hyperlinks are therefore essential to the creation and functioning of the World Wide Web. A link is
             not a transmission or communication of the work but a reference to an already available work.

             Furthermore, sharing hyperlinks on the internet is one of the most common activities. Requiring the
             authorisation of a rightholder before sharing a hyperlink would not only be cumbersome but would
             also severely undermine the fundamental right of free speech.

             Hyperlinking in general should not be considered as an act of communication to the public (see
             European Copyright Society Opinion on Case C-466/12 Svensson)1 as:

                  “Firstly, the right of communication to the public requires a transmission that is absent when
                  merely a hyperlink is provided. It is merely a location tool, but exists independently from the
                  actual availability of the work. Secondly, the communication should address a public or a “new”
                  public. The hyperlink does not extend the public of the work, published online: those who had
                  access to the web page will still have access, those who did not have access (e.g. absent the
                  payment of a fee) will not gain access through the hyperlink.”

                  3. The viewing of a web-page should not be subject to the authorisation of the
                     rightholder

             Question: 12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
             a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of
             the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
             authorisation of the rightholder?

             The viewing of web-pages is a widely accepted, general practice and part of the everyday life of
             users all around the world. If merely viewing, without downloading or printing a website was subject
             to copyright, many people are likely to infringe copyright while browsing the internet and coming
             across websites containing copyright protected material.2

             Although the normal use of the internet involves the creation of copies, this is the automatic result
             of browsing the internet. The making of such copies in the cache is indispensable for efficient web-
             browsing and therefore in line with Article 5 (1) of the Directive 2001/29/EC. The copies retained on
             the screen or in the cache are merely the incidental consequence of the use of a computer, and
             are temporary.

             Furthermore, as suggested in the opinion of the UK Supreme Court “it has never been an
             infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an infringing article in
             physical form.”3



                  4. The terms of copyright protection should be adjust to the digital environment

             Question: 20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
             environment?

             The current terms are excessively long and are nowadays a crucial limitation to the availability of
             content online. The term of 50 years after the death of the author prescribed by the Berne
             convention of 1886 are not fit for the digital environment, which has the unlimited potential of
             dissemination of cultural material. The 70 years after the death of the author term of protection
             provided by the EU is hardly incentivizing the production of content and its dissemination.

             Shortening the term of protection at least until the minimum 50 years provided by the Berne
             Convention would create a competitive advantage to EU enterprises creating and distributing
             content as they would gain accessibility to 20 years of currently protected material.

                  5. The limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives lack flexibility
                     and therefore need to be revised

             Question: 21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
             provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States? and

             Question: 24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
             degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

             ISPA believes that the current European copyright legislation needs to be revised in order to
             improve and harmonise rights as well as protection systems and adapt them to the development of
             the Information Society. Some areas of traditional copyright rules risk to be unable to keep peace
             with the changes in the way intellectual property circulates over communications networks.

             Furthermore, the exhaustive list of strictly defined exceptions lacks flexibility to adapt to the
             changes occurring in a rapidly evolving environment for content, creation, access and distribution.

             In the interest of all stakeholders, it is essential to offer the broadest, reasonable and most
             predictive scope to the exceptions in Article 5, under the condition that these be read within the
             context of the three-step test described in Article 5.5.



                  6. New limitations and exceptions should be added to the existing catalogue

             Question: 23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
             existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

             [Open question]

             Considering the large size and increasing number of user-generated content, failure to adopt the
             copyright regime to the digital reality risks creating a situation where activities perceived as normal
             by users are made illegal. This would undermine the credibility of copyright law among average
             users and thus threaten broader right holder interest.

             In order to clearly recognise the difference between the use of protected material as part of user-
             generated new content (e.g. mashups) and illegal file sharing of a work, it would be necessary to
             adapt the copyright regime to include audiovisual content which incorporates users’ creative
             output, creating this way a completely new work. ISPA believes that the exceptions for non-
             commercial use should be broadened.

                  7. Digital copies made by end users for private purposes should not be a subject to
                     private copying levies

             Question: 65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a
             service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal,
             be subject to private copying levies?

             Licensed copies should not trigger the application of levies. According to Recital 35 of Directive
             2001/29/EC, “In cases where rightholders have already received payment in some other form, for
             instance as part of a license fee, no specific or separate payment may be due.”

             Making these digital copies subject to levies would create a situation of double payment and would
             go against the view and expectations of the end users as service providers usually acquire license
             from the right holder that covers all relevant acts in the given service, including reproduction by the
             end user.

             ISPA therefore strongly rejects private copy levies but urges to simplify and harmonise the process
             of granting licenses to ISPs. The acquisition of content or services licensed by the rightholders
             implies already the usage of digital copies for private purposes. Therefore such copies should not
             be a subject to private copying levies in order to avoid a situation of double payment as the right to
             copy content several times is usually covered by the license fee paid by the consumer.



                  8. Levies should be made visible to end customers

             Question: 67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
             subject to levies?

             Making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies, on the one hand would create a
             trusted relationship with the user. On the other hand transparency of the system would also
             contribute to the better remuneration of authors. ISPA therefore strongly supports the idea of
             making copyright levies visible to end users. ISPA emphasise however that the appropriate way of
             making the levies visible to the end users is through displaying it on the invoice and not through
             marketing communication (advertising).

                  9. The civil enforcement system for infringements of copyright committed with a
                     commercial purpose in the EU should be done in the context of the IPRED and not
                     separately in the Information Society Directive

             Question: 75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
             infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose? and
             Question: 77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
             achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
             protection of private life and protection of personal data?

             ISPA considers that the current framework, the Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of
             intellectual property rights (IPRED) together with the E-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC offer a
             well-balanced and functioning framework to address in particular online IPR infringements. The
             reason for this is that IPRED contains checks and balances for enforcement which are not present
             in the Copyright Directive. They ensure that the protection of IPR is balanced with fundamental
             freedoms and rights.4

             If problems arise in the uniform respect of copyright, they stem from the late or uncompleted
             implementation of the IPRED at national level and not from its legal provisions. However, should
             there be in the future a need to address the enforcement of copyright, this should be done in the
             context of the IPRED and not separately in the Information Society Directive, for the reasons
             mentioned above.



                  10. The current legal framework is clear enough to inhibit online copyright infringements
                      with a commercial purpose

             Question: 76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
             involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
             service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
             commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
             intermediaries?

             [Open question]

             Articles 9 and 11 of the IPRED already foresee the possibility of injunctions against intermediaries
             whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR infringement, and lay down the
             minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national courts when formulating injunctive
             measures.

             At the same time article 12-15 of the E-Commerce Directive demand that such injunctions are
             proportionate and cannot result in general monitoring obligations. In the past years the Court of
             Justice of the European Union kept refining the possible scope of injunctions against internet

             4
               freedoms of expression, the free movement of information, the protection of personal data in paragraphs 2 and 15 of
             Directive 2004/48/EC, Article 2 (3) (a) of Directive 2004/48/EC

             intermediaries (e.g. C-324/09 - L’oreal./.eBay; C-70/10 - Scarlet Extended, C-360/Sabam/Netlog)
             and made clear that such injunctions need to be very specific with regards to the measures to be
             taken by intermediaries and must not merely be success oriented. General filtering systems
             installed for the prevention of copyright infringements were held disproportionate by the court.

             Multi-stakeholder cooperation should not be limited to ISP cooperating with rightholders to defend
             the latter existing business models. Cooperation should also concern:

                     Widespread availability of legal online content in affordable price
                     Empowerment and education of consumers

             Furthermore, currently DG Marked of the Commission is working on an Action Plan addressing IPR
             infringement.5

             The initiative recognises the wide range of intermediaries and aims at exploring non-legislative
             initiatives, such as:

                     improve exchange of information and cooperation between relevant authorities in charge of
                      enforcement of IPR in the Member States
                     strengthen due diligence across the entire supply chains for products/services which
                      depend heavily on intellectual property
                     develop an MoU on advertising/ ‘Follow the Money’ approach
