   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES

N.B. We answer this question concerning the private copying exception only.

Recital (10) of Directive 2001/29/EU of 22 May 2001 states : “If authors  or
performers are to continue their creative and artistic work,  they  have  to
receive an appropriate reward for the use of their work, as  must  producers
in order to be able to finance this work”.

Although the manufacturers represented by SECIMAVI are fully  in  line  with
this statement and value the protection of intellectual property,  we  think
-nevertheless- that there are several reasons  why  there  is  an  impellent
need to clarify the scope and application of the private  copying  exception
and therefore levies at a EU level and  that these  are  reinforced  by  the
digital environment :

   1. Private copying concerns exclusively legally acquired works or subject-
      matters;
   2.  The  French  national  transposition  of   the   concept   of   ‘fair
      compensation’ as expressed  in  Directive  2001/29/EU  does  not  seem
      consistent with the interpretations given by the Court of  Justice  of
      the European Union in the Padawan case;
   3. The form, the financing/collection and the levels of fair compensation
      of private copying exception are extremely  different  amongst  Member
      States;
   4. Differences amongst Member States and lack of  pan-European  coherence
      and harmonization cause the emergence of grey markets;
   5. Distortion of competition is to  be  observed  amongst  Member  States
      where private copying levies do not exist and  those  where  they  are
      extremely high, like in France. Other national  interpretation  issues
      can cause additional competition distortion, as  it  is  the  case  in
      France;
   6. The digital environment changes the  paradigm  in  which  the  private
      copying exception was thought and developed, unlinking the fruition of
      a work or subject-matter from the physical medium it is stored onto.


1. Private copying concerns exclusively legally acquired works  or  subject-
matters;

Private copying levies cannot be applied  to  works/files  which  have  been
illegally acquired or for which technical protection was illegally  removed.
This is an important point  because  we  feel  that  in  several  cases  the
calculation of the amount of prejudice caused to the  rightholders  for  the
private copying exception does not only take  into  account  the  recompense
for harm caused by the introduction of this exception, but also the loss  of
gains for the audiovisual industry  due  to  illegal  file  downloading  and
exchange. We think that private copying levies should stick to the  original
intent which is to compensate the harm caused to rightholders by the act  of
copying by a natural person for private use  and  not  become  a  roundabout
means to introduce a global license for downloading. The global  license  is
and should remain a different debate.


2. The French national transposition of the concept of  ‘fair  compensation’
as expressed in Directive 2001/29/EU  does  not  seem  consistent  with  the
interpretations given by the Court of Justice of the European Union  in  the
Padawan case;

Art. 5 (2) (b) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the  European  Parliament  and  of
the Council of 22 May  2001  states  :  “  Member  States  may  provide  for
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right provided for in  Article
2 in the following cases : [...] (b) in  respect  of  reproductions  on  any
medium made by a natural person for  private  use  and  for  ends  that  are
neither directly nor indirectly commercial, on condition  that  rightholders
receive fair compensation which takes account of  the  application  or  non-
application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 to  the  work
or subject-matter concerned” (bold text is ours).

The interpretation of the concept of fair compensation  has  been  addressed
by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the  Padawan  case  in  its
Judgement of 21 October 2010[59] which states : “1.  The  concept  of  ‘fair
compensation’,  within  the  meaning  of  Article   5(2)(b)   of   Directive
2001/29/EC [...], is an autonomous concept of European Union law which  must
be interpreted uniformly  in  all  Member  States  that  have  introduced  a
private copying exception,  irrespective  of  the  power  conferred  on  the
Member States  to  determine  [...]  the  form,  detailed  arrangements  for
financing and collection, and the level of that fair compensation.”
“2. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29  must  be  interpreted  as  meaning
that the ‘fair balance’  between  the  persons  concerned  means  that  fair
compensation must be calculated on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  of  harm
caused to authors of protected works by  the  introduction  of  the  private
copying exception” (text in bold is ours).

Recitals 39, 40 and 42 of the Padawan judgment  state:  “[...]  The  private
copying exception must therefore include a system  ‘to  compensate  for  the
prejudice  to   rightholders’”.   “[...]   From   that   perspective,   fair
compensation must be regarded as recompense for the  harm  suffered  by  the
author”. “[...] fair compensation must  necessarily  be  calculated  on  the
basis of the criterion of the harm caused to authors of protected  works  by
the introduction of private copying exception.” (text in bold is ours).

This leads us to consider that the transposition of the  European  Directive
2001/29/EU in the French Intellectual Property Code does not take  into  due
consideration the  concepts  of  fair  compensation,  fair  balance  and  of
prejudice to the rightholders. In articles L311-1 to L311-8  of  the  French
Intellectual Property Code, modified by the law n° 2011-1898 of 20  December
2001, the term “rémunération” is quoted  22  times  concerning  the  private
copying levies. Now the term remuneration implies  a  payment  for  received
goods or services and would rather be in the scope of exclusive rights  than
in  that  of  a  ‘fair  compensation’  based  upon  the   harm   caused   to
rightholders. In the French Intellectual Property Code the remuneration  for
private copying is a lump sum the amount of which is function  of  the  type
of medium, of its duration or of its recording capacity, of the use  of  the
medium and of the technical measures. The notions  of  ‘fair  compensation’,
‘fair balance’ and evaluation of the harm caused to the rightholders by  the
introduction  of  the  private  copying  exception  are  absent   from   the
definition of remuneration for private copying in the French IPC.


3. The form, the financing/collection and the levels  of  fair  compensation
of private copying exception are extremely different amongst Member States;

Numerous  differences  appear  in  the  treatment  of  the  private  copying
exception[60]/[61] by Member States leading to:

      a. different recording equipment / devices being included in the scope
      of private copying levies;


      b. different methods used to calculate levies and therefore  different
      tariffs;


      c. different institutions / regulatory structures deciding the  amount
      of  prejudice  and  its  repartition  amongst  recording  equipment  /
      devices;


      d.  different  payers  of  private  copying  levies  :  manufacturers,
      importers, distributors, consumers;


      e. different redistribution to the rightholders with methods  implying
      both direct remuneration and indirect  remuneration.  In  this  latter
      case, different percentages of the global sum collected by each member
      State  under  the  private  copying  levy  is  redistributed  to   the
      rightholders via  social  and  cultural  institutions  set  for  their
      benefit;


      f. very different per capita impacts of private copying levies in  the
      different Member States, as pointed out by  the  de  Thuiskopie  study
      2012  in  collaboration  with  WIPO   (World   Intellectual   Property
      organization)[62].


Taking into account in particular this latter point, we  can  see  from  the
table below (adapted from the table at page 12 of the  de  Thuiskopie  study
cited in footnote 62), that the differences in amounts collected  by  Member
States applying private copying levies are very  important  when  calculated
at a per capita rate and that 5 Member States, out of the 26 studied  by  de
Thuiskopie, do not apply private copying  levies  at  all:  United  Kingdom,
Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus.
France is, following these calculations, the  Member  State  collecting  the
higher per capita private copying  levy  (2.99€  per  inhabitant),  slightly
ahead of Germany. Only 7 Member  States  have  per  capita  private  copying
levies above 1€, 3 out of which exceed the threshold of  2€,  the  remaining
19 countries charging from 0 to 0.96€ per capita to take  into  account  the
harm caused to rightholders by the private copying exception.
These significant differences question by themselves  the  fact  that  ‘fair
compensation’ is actually interpreted uniformly in  all  Member  States,  as
set forth in the Padawan judgment (rule 1)[63]. But  more  than  that,  they
point out possible competition distortions amongst Member States, which  can
cause particular  harm  in  a  global  context  where  online  international
commerce grows steadily.

4. Differences amongst Member States and lack of pan-European coherence  and
harmonization cause the emergence of grey markets;


The differences in amounts of private copying levies amongst  Member  States
cause grey market issues. To give an example,  today  in  France  the  local
market of external HDDs suffers considerably, as  consumers  prefer  to  buy
HDDs online from internet sites based in  countries  where  the  levies  are
much lower than in France or inexistent (Luxembourg for instance).  A  major
online  seller  like  Amazon  presently  only  hosts  on  his  French   site
marketplace offers for external HDDs but no own.
Another market which has been historically highly impacted  by  the  tariffs
of private copying levies is the  CD/DVD  market.  In  France  private  copy
levies range in 2013 from 0.35€/unit for a CD to 0.90€/unit for a  DVD,  vs.
no private copying levies in the UK and levies 6  to  7  times  inferior  in
Germany. In October 2011 a group of professional organizations  representing
French consumer electronics manufacturers and importers (amongst  which  the
SECIMAVI), led by Digital Europe, went in delegation to Brussels to  present
the specific situation of private copy in France to members of the  European
Commission.  On  that  occasion,  the  delegation  of  French   professional
organizations presented a simulation on the impact that the  extremely  high
tariffs of private copying levies on CDs/DVDs in France had on sales of  CDs
and DVDs on the French territory.

What the table above demonstrates (based  upon  data  collected  in  October
2011) is that the average local country consumption of CDs  and  DVDs  is  a
direct function of the amount per unit of private copying levies,  therefore
the higher the private copying levies, the lower the  national  consumption.
In France, for instance, only 0.3 CDs per person are bought yearly,  against
0.87 CDs in Germany and 1 CD per capita in  the  UK.  Proportions  are  even
more impressive for DVDs, where only 0.18 DVDs per capita are bought  yearly
in France, against 0.71 in Germany and 1.1 in the UK.
If we sum on the one hand populations and on the other hand consumptions  of
CDs and DVDs  in  UK  +  Germany,  we  can  come  to  the  combined  average
consumption per capita of these two countries which amounts to 0.9  CDs  per
capita per annum and 0.84 DVDs. If we now multiply this average  consumption
by the French population of 62.6 million, we come to  the  estimated  weight
of the French market of CDs and DVDs in the hypothesis that private  copying
levies were comparable in France to the average levies applied in the  other
two countries. Following this estimation, the French  market  should  be  of
roughly 57 million CDs and 52 million DVDs.  The  difference  between  these
numbers and the actual French market of 18.6 million CDs  and  11.3  million
DVDs is the grey market.
Grey market estimate sales of 38 million CDs and 41  million  DVDs  are  not
only lost for the French commerce representatives, but also for  the  French
State who loses both VAT and corporate taxes.


5. Distortion of competition is to be observed amongst Member  States  where
private copying levies do not exist  and  those  where  they  are  extremely
high, like  in  France.  Other  national  interpretation  issues  can  cause
additional competition distortion, as it is the case in France;

Severe distortion of competition is to be deplored  between  actors  of  the
internal EU market. Distant selling abolishes frontiers  and  consumers  buy
(identical) products  wherever  they  are  the  least  expensive.  For  this
reason, in France the sales of certain categories  of  consumer  electronics
products are  severely  decreasing  and  entire  segments  of  the  consumer
electronics industry are at risk: blank recording media  and  external  HDDs
are typically in this case.  Following  information   contained  in  the  de
Thuiskopie 2012 study (62) for instance, private copying  levies  for  1  To
HDDs, in markets geographically close to France, like  Belgium  or  Germany,
amount respectively to 6.75€/unit and 9€/unit versus 20€/unit in France.

Competition distortions can arise also within  the  French  national  market
when interpretations of the applicability  of  tariffs  differ.  In  France,
this is typically  the  case  with  two  categories  of  products  on  which
different private copying levies  can  be  applied  to  the  same  identical
product. The first example is that of smartphones: importers on  the  French
market can declare the nominal memory of the smartphone for the  calculation
of private copying levies (for instance 16 GB), but can  also  declare  only
the memory that is actually available to make copies  and  not  occupied  by
the operating system (for instance 16 MB - 3MB used by  the  OS  =  13  MB).
Therefore, depending on how the product is declared, the applicable fee  for
private copying levies differs.
The same is true for external HDDs. A PCL  tariff  of  20€/unit  applies  to
HDDs up to 1000 Go and a tariff  of  0.015€/Go  applies  for  products  with
storage  capacity  superior  to  1000  Go.  Now,  following  the   type   of
equivalence used for 1 To HDDs (mathematical,  i.e.  1  To  =  1000  Go;  or
binary, i.e. 1 To = 1024 Go), the applicable tariff goes from 20€ to  15.36€
!

Distortions of competition amongst Member States and amongst importers  into
a Member State create confusion and are deplorable to ensure the clarity  of
the system and its equal applicability to all concerned stakeholders.


6. The digital  environment  changes  the  paradigm  in  which  the  private
copying exception was thought and developed, unlinking  the  fruition  of  a
work or subject-matter from the physical medium it is stored onto.

Cloud computing allows users to access all of their  digital  content  on  a
distant server from  several  connected  devices,  at  all  times  and  from
anywhere provided an internet connection is available. The fruition  of  the
work from the cloud does not need a local private copy of the file  and  the
file stored on the distant server is not necessarily a copy  either,  as  it
can have been purchased in the  framework  of  licensing  contracts  between
rightholders and users.

In a context  of  growingly  dematerialized  fruition,  the  calculation  of
private copying levies based on different types  of  storage  media  and  on
storage capacities seems both difficult to pursue and outdated. As we  point
out thoroughly in answer to question 71, private  copying  levies  shall  be
more easily harmonized throughout Europe  if  they  are  calculated  on  the
price of the work itself rather than on the physical storage media on  which
the work or subject matter is stored.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[64]

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO

We think that licensed copies should not trigger the application of  private
copying levies when rightholders  have  already  received  compensation  for
licensed  content,  including  subsequent  copies,  in  the   framework   of
licensing contracts.

In his mediation report on  private  copying  and  reprography  levies,  Mr.
Vitorino recommends: “Clarifying that copies that are made by end users  for
private purposes in the context of a  service  that  has  been  licensed  by
rightholders  do  not  cause  any  harm  that   would   require   additional
remuneration in the form of private copying levies” [...] The opposite  view
would pave the way for double payments.  Consumers  cannot  be  expected  to
show understanding for such double payments”.

Vitorino’s recommendation is in line with recital  (35)  of  the  2001/29/EU
Directive stating “[...] In cases where rightholders have  already  received
payment in some other form, for instance  as  part  of  a  license  fee,  no
specific or separate payment may be due.  The  level  of  fair  compensation
should take full account of the degree of use  of  technological  protection
measures referred to in this Directive.  In  certain  situations  where  the
prejudice to the rightholder would be minimal,  no  obligation  for  payment
may arise.”

Three elements arise from this recital:

- in case exclusive rights  have  been  negotiated  through  a  license  fee
authorizing copies for private use, no additional  compensation  is  due  by
the end user. This is typically the case of digital  audio  or  video  files
that include in their selling price the  compensation  for  the  possibility
for their buyer (natural person) to make  a  certain  number  of  copies  on
different personal devices for their private use.  Recent  studies[65]  have
demonstrated that consumers in France dispose in average  of  6-7  different
devices at home on which they can access legally  acquired  video  or  audio
content. If consumers have already paid with the price  of  the  audio/video
file they acquired the possibility of  storing  it  onto  several  different
devices, then they shouldn't be paying again the private  copying  exception
on the storage media.

- in cases where technical measures have been taken in order to prevent  the
copying of a work (DRM - Digital Rights Management,  for  instance),  it  is
evident that no copy can possibly be legally made by a  natural  person  for
his/her private use. As the illegal copying of files / works does  not  fall
under the scope of the private copying exception, we must  deduce  that  all
protected physical recording media and all protected  files  should  not  be
the object of private copying levies, as no harm to the rightholders can  be
retained in this specific case. Motion pictures on DVDs  or  Blu-ray  Discs,
for instance, are protected by DRM techniques preventing the users  to  copy
them onto a blank DVD for their private use. So blank DVDs  cannot  be  used
to store copyrighted videos. In  France,  though,  the  calculation  of  the
private copying levies on DVDs is made taking into account the  price  of  4
entry tickets to a motion picture theater plus the selling price of a  video
DVD or Blu-ray disc…

- In the evolution of uses, content is less and less stored onto a  physical
device and increasingly made available from a distant  server  (cloud)  from
which it can be accessed by the user from any location provided a  Wi-Fi  or
mobile connection is available.
So, with the advent  of  the  cloud,  we  go  from  a  concept  of  physical
ownership  and  multiple-device  storage  to  a  concept  of  dematerialized
ownership and ubiquitous access/fruition  of  a  work.  Therefore  unless  a
local copy of the work is made  under  unlicensed  conditions,  the  concept
itself of private copying does not apply to the cloud, as no actual copy  of
the audio, visual or written work is made.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


In the uses of cloud services, there are, in our opinion, two  cases  to  be
considered :

   1. the first use is the downloading on local storage media  of  distantly
      stored files. In this case, there is no reason to submit cloud storage
      to private copying levies, as  the  storage/recording  media  used  to
      store the downloaded files locally  are  already  submitted  to  these
      levies, and consumers would pay twice. Moreover  licensing  agreements
      between rightholders and service providers often contractually include
      a number of licensed copies enabling the user to store copies  of  the
      work on a number of personal devices for private use. Once  again,  if
      cloud services were to be  submitted  separately  to  private  copying
      levies, consumers would pay at least twice and maybe even three  times
      : once for licensed content, once for the storage device and once  for
      the cloud service. Last but not least, if the  solution  advocated  by
      SECIMAVI in answer to  question  71  were  to  be  adopted,  i.e.  the
      instauration of a private copying license on the work itself, the same
      reasoning would apply, as  private  copying  levies  would  have  been
      already paid within the price of the file;

   2. the second  use  of  cloud  services  is  access-based  (for  instance
      streaming only), i.e. the phonogram, videogram or book is never stored
      or copied locally, but its fruition is directly  from  the  cloud.  In
      this second case, there is no act of private copying as  the  file  is
      only heard, visualized or read, but never copied. The key concept here
      is fruition. The same way consumers can read a physical book  as  many
      times as they want, provided they carry the book around with them,  in
      the same way they can visualize, listen to or read  a  file  from  the
      cloud as many times as  they  wish,  provided  they  have  a  wireless
      connection and an audio-visual  device  to  do  so.  Furthermore,  the
      number of fruitions can be limited  by  means  of  DRM  and  licensing
      agreements, for instance in cases where the rightholders would like to
      apply a different price for a single fruition,  a  limited  number  of
      fruitions or unlimited fruitions of a work. This is  the  already  the
      case of VoD, where different prices apply depending on whether viewers
      only want to watch the video once or if they want to buy it and  store
      it locally for unlimited future viewing. We are here in the  exclusive
      right’s domain and not in the private copying exception.

Moreover, how would it be possible to apply national private copying  levies
to cloud services which are by nature global and transnational?  What  would
the effects be on fair competition and on the Single Market?

Cloud services represent  in  our  view  future  boosters  of  the  European
dematerialized economy in a worldwide context,  and  to  start  taxing  them
with private copying levies could hinder their  development  before  it  has
actually even started!

  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[66]

€ YES

We definitely plead for the instauration of a “visible fee”  for  the  final
consumer and not only on invoices for  professional  users  but  also,  when
possible, on till receipts for final consumers, natural persons. France  has
recently published a decree on  publicity  of  private  copying  levies  for
buyers of recording media submitted to private  copying  levies  (Decree  n°
2013-1141 of 10 December 2013) with an  application  date  set  at  the  1st
April 2014.

Information about private copying levies will be given in France:
    ● at the point of sale  through  clear  and  legible  displays  situated
      near the media/devices concerned;
    ● on invoice, when the recording material  is  sold  to  a  professional
      buyer, legal person;
    ● by any other means permitting proof and before the conclusion  of  the
      contract, in case of online sales  or  in  case  of  impossibility  to
      physically display the information at the point of sale.

The information provided  to  the  buyers  of  recording  media  imposed  by
private copying levies in France will be:
    ● The amount of the private copying levy applicable  to  each  recording
      media;
    ● The existence of an explicative manual informing about the  scope  and
      purposes of  the  private  copying  remuneration  and  mentioning  the
      possibilities of exoneration and reimbursement;
    ● The URL of the internet site  intended  for  the  information  of  the
      public and where a  dematerialized  version  of  the  manual  will  be
      consultable and downloadable (www.copieprivee.culture.gouv.fr)

We think that visible private copying levies contribute to:
    ● a better information of the general public and of  the  end  consumer,
      who is -in fine- the payer of  the  levy,  on  the  existence  of  the
      private copying exception and the  scope  and  use  of  the  collected
      amounts (including the financing of cultural events, which amounts  to
      25% of the collected sums in France)
    ● precise information on  the  possibility  of  reimbursement  in  cases
      where the use of recording material is manifestly not linked  to  acts
      of private copying of copyright protected works;
    ●  making  the  reimbursement  of  professional  users  possible  (today
      reimbursement is blocked in France because one of  the  conditions  is
      the visibility on invoices of  the  paid  amount  of  private  copying
      levies);
    ●  enabling  the   possibility,   as   suggested   by   Mr.   Vitorino’s
      recommendations, that in the future the liability of  the  payment  of
      levies be shifted from manufacturers and importers to retailers.

Although visibility of private copying levies  for  the  final  consumer  in
uncontestably an important step to take, we  also  think  that  transparency
and visibility on the use of the collected funds by collecting societies  is
of the highest importance, in particular as far as the  percentages  devoted
to social and cultural purposes are concerned.

This information is allegedly public in  France.  An  article  published  in
October 2013[67] describes the incredible path of  a  journalist  trying  to
have access to this data (after several months of insistent  requests)  only
to  discover  that  information  could  only  be  consulted  on  paper   (no
electronic files available!), in person at the Ministry of Culture during  3
hours and without any possibility to make copies.
In an era where  Administrations  seek  transparency,  end-users  and  other
intermediary  payers  of  private  copying  levies,  should  definitely   be
informed of  the  use  of  the  amounts  to  which  they  have  directly  or
indirectly contributed.
Françoise Castex’ final report[68] “Calls on the Member  States  to  publish
reports on allocation of proceeds in open source format  with  interpretable
data” and French Minister of Culture Aurélie  Filippetti  recently  declared
during the “Rencontres Cinématographiques de Dijon”  that  she  intended  to
bring more transparency in the use of the 25% of private copying levies  for
social and cultural purposes and that, in  order  to  do  that,  reports  of
collecting  societies  should  be  normalized  under  the  same  format  and
dematerialized on easily consultable files.
We fully support both these initiatives.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[69].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

In  the  current  system  levies  are  to  be  paid  by  the  first   entity
(manufacturer, importer,  wholesaler)  placing  recording  material  on  the
domestic market of a Member State, regardless of the fact that  a  levy  has
already been paid before in other Member States. As a consequence,  products
being re-exported from one Member State to another by the  said  entity  are
levied at least twice in the majority of cross-border transactions.
One of the most  difficult  cases  is  that  of  wholesalers  who  buy  from
manufacturers (who place the goods on the market) to  re-export  in  another
country. In this specific  case,  the  process  of  reimbursement  of  undue
levies is complicated by the  fact  that  the  collecting  societies  cannot
reimburse the wholesaler  directly  but  need  to  receive  a  reimbursement
request by the company responsible of  first  placing  the  product  on  the
national market (in this example the  manufacturer).  This  means  that  the
wholesaler cannot be  reimbursed  of  unduly  paid  private  copying  levies
unless  his  supplier  (whose  invoice  has  been  paid  by  the  wholesaler
including private copying levies) is  reimbursed  first  and  transfers  the
money to the wholesaler. On the sales side, the  wholesaler  cannot  in  his
turn easily invoice PCL to his cross-border buyer, as this latter will  have
to pay a different PCL  when  placing  goods  for  the  first  time  on  his
national market. Wholesalers pay therefore in  many  cases  private  copying
levies that they  cannot  recoup  either  from  their  buyers  or  from  the
collecting society.
[pic]
In France, Copie France (collecting society),  pushed  by  the  wholesalers,
has officially asked  the  Directorate  General  of  Public  Finance  to  be
entitled to make reimbursements directly to  the  re-exporting  wholesalers.
The answer of the French Directorate General of Public Finance has been  “In
the absence of an express provision  in  Article  L.311-8  of  the  Code  of
Intellectual Property for the  reimbursement  of  remuneration  for  private
copying directly to the exporter, only the manufacturer,  in  the  situation
where  the  media  are  not  placed  onto  the  French   market,   can   get
reimbursement of unduly paid private copying levy [...]”.

Given the complexity of the system of ex-post reimbursements, the  risks  of
double payments incurred by re-exporters and  the  length  of  reimbursement
processes,  we  think  levies  should  be  paid  in  the  country  of  final
destination of the goods only, and -as expressed in the previous answer  and
pleaded by Mr. Vitorino- by retailers. We also plead for  a  system  of  ex-
ante exoneration for professional users which seems to better correspond  to
the intentions of the European legislator and the recent decisions taken  by
the European Court of Justice, namely in the Padawan case.
The conclusions of Françoise Castex’ report (see footnote 68) seem to go  in
the same direction at least concerning cross-border  transactions  when  she
“12. Recommends, in the case  of  cross-border  transactions,  that  private
copying levies be collected in the  Member  State  in  which  the  end  user
having purchased the products resides [...]” and also concerning “18.  [...]
transparent exemption rules for professional uses in order  to  ensure  that
they are exempt [...]”. Françoise Castex’ report  also  “19.  Calls  on  the
Member States to ensure that private copy  levies  never  have  to  be  paid
where the media in question are used for  professional  purposes,  and  that
the  various  arrangements  for  the  reimbursement  of  levies   paid   for
professional users are replaced with  systems  which  guarantee  that  these
users are not liable to pay the levy in the first place”.

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

The impact study annexed to the French law n°  2011-1898  of  December  20th
2011 concerning private copying remuneration, estimates  professional  flows
at roughly “20 to 30 % of the remunerations perceived every year”,  that  is
to say 40 to 60 M€ over the total of 200 M€ collected every  year  by  Copie
France.
In April 2013, Deputy Isabelle ATTARD asked the French Ministry of  Culture,
to specify the amount of reimbursements to  professional  users  established
by Copie France since the publishing of the above-mentioned law[70].
The answer, published in July 2013, acknowledges that, as of  May  14  2013,
294 requests for reimbursement for professional uses had been  received,  of
which 176 had been accepted and 118 refused by Copie  France  under  several
reasons (media acquired before the entry into  force  of  the  law,  private
copying  levy  amount  not  shown  on   invoice,   entity   requesting   the
reimbursement is not the final user, media not subject  to  private  copying
levy). The total sums reimbursed to professional users until  June  4  2013,
are of 167 971 € (VAT excl.) in total, namely 67 000 € in 2012 and  100  971
€ in 2013. In 2012 the  reimbursed  sums  in  France  represented  therefore
barely 0.13% of the estimated global amounts of PCL  for  professional  uses
of the year.

  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]

We have seen previously that the work and subject matters  have  a  tendency
to be more and more dematerialized and that consumers, in a world  which  is
becoming global and where mobility is  the  new  paradigm,  wish  ubiquitous
fruition of music, video and written works.
Be it for phonograms, videograms or printed material,  the  availability  of
dematerialized  electronic  files  becomes  increasingly  important  in  the
business  model  of  a  work.  This  is  why  rightholders  have  negotiated
agreements in order to make their work available in a  dematerialized  form.
In France, for instance,  publishing  contracts  must  include  a  digitized
version of the written work  or  else  the  author  can  withdraw  from  the
contract.[71]
In the video world, at an international level, we have seen  the  appearance
of the Ultraviolet business model which gives access to  a  digital  version
of the purchased videogram that the consumer can stream or download  on  any
of his/her screens. The Ultraviolet videos can be  bought  online  or  on  a
physical disc (DVD, Blu-ray) and the digital version  can  be  stored  on  a
personalized library in the cloud. The  price  of  the  product  includes  a
license fee allowing up to 5 members of the family to  watch  the  videogram
each on their own devices. This corresponds -in fact- to a  private  copying
right granted to the family circle and covered by a licensing  fee  included
in the price  of  the  work.  The  same  business  model  applies  to  music
platforms such as iTunes or Amazon  MP3  where  customers,  once  they  have
bought a piece of music or an album, can listen to it  either  by  streaming
it from the cloud or downloading it on personal players.  In  the  price  of
the phonogram is included the right to download (and thus private copy)  the
phonogram onto a certain number of  devices  (10  devices  for  Amazon,  for
instance). Therefore the right to copy is already taken  into  consideration
in the price of the work and transformed from an exception to the  copyright
into a license,  i.e.  an  exclusive  right,  taking  into  account  a  fair
compensation of the harm caused to rightholders by the copies.

The above analyzed tendencies, lead us to plead for a  generalization  of  a
system  where  a  withholding  license,  which  takes  into   account   fair
compensation of the harm caused to authors, interpreters  and  producers  by
natural persons copying  works  for  their  private  use,  would  be  levied
directly on the work and subsequently transferred onto its selling price.
This approach has been put forward in France, amongst others,  by  Professor
of Law Pierre-Yves Gautier[72] who  has  expressed  the  need  for  a  total
overhaul of the private copying levies’ system in France. He  has  suggested
that private copying levies be imposed  on  works  (phonograms,  videograms,
written works, etc.) rather than on recording/storage media.

SECIMAVI fully agrees with this approach which  not  only  accommodates  the
increasing dematerialization of works and the need  expressed  by  consumers
for ubiquitous consumption, but also solves  a  number  of  delicate  issues
that the actual private copying levies’ systems raise.

First of all this system  would  guarantee  that  only  the  works  acquired
licitly by the consumer would be submitted to  private  copying  levies.  In
fact the private copying levy would be applied when and where  the  sale  is
finalized and the  price  paid  by  the  buyer.  Illicit  downloading  would
therefore not be included in the private copying levies’ fair  compensation,
as has been the case in France up to a relatively recent past.

This way, when  a  natural  person  buys  a  work,  he/she  will  compensate
directly the author for his/her right of copying this work for private use.

This solution presents numerous advantages:

For rightholders:
    ● The assurance that their rights are preserved;
    ● A right to private copying systematically levied each time a  work  is
      sold. This would avoid losing private copying levies  when  a  storage
      media does not fall under the scope of private copying  in  a  country
      (example : PCs are not submitted to private copying levies in  France,
      therefore artists do not get a compensation for files stored on a PC)
    ● Redistribution of private copying levies  amongst  rightholders  would
      be managed directly by collective  societies  who  already  deal  with
      collective rights management and have the experience and the processes
      in place to organize their repartition;
    ●  Collective  societies  would  no  longer  be  compelled   to   manage
      exonerations / reimbursements of professional buyers or reimbursements
      in case of re-exported goods;
    ● Collected sums  would  be  strictly  connected  to  purchases  on  the
      national territory, avoiding losses of fair  compensation  induced  by
      today’s grey market on storage media (see the example of external HDDs
      and CDs/DVDs given in answer to question 64 (point 4) and  by  storage
      of works in the cloud, which is presently  not  submitted  to  private
      copying levies in France
    ● The questioning about how cloud storage could  contribute  to  private
      copy levies would lose sense, because each work acquired  legally  and
      stored in the cloud would have paid its license to private copying;

For consumers:
    ● More transparency, as  consumers  would  be  better  informed  on  the
      price paid to authors for the ‘fair compensation’ of private  copying.
      This price would be directly linked to the work acquired legally;
    ● The distinction between personal  and  professional  uses  of  storage
      media, which triggers (or not) the applicability  of  private  copying
      levies, and  which is linked today to the purchase of  storage  media,
      would lose sense, as only the buyer of an audio, video or written work
      would be subject to private copying levies;
    ● A more equitable system for consumers as 100% of the  private  copying
      levies would be linked to the copied  works  which  is  not  the  case
      today. In fact, on  the  one  hand  storage/recording  media  are  not
      necessarily used for private copying purposes and -on the other  hand-
      some  private  copying  tariffs  in  France  take  into  consideration
      categories of copies  which should be excluded, as for instance :  DRM
      copy protected media (DVDs for  instance),  which  are  by  definition
      uncopyable; trailers, which only have a promotional objective; and car
      radios for which no private copying habits are actually accounted for.

For professional users:
    ● Professional users of storage/recording media  wouldn’t  have  to  pay
      in advance undue private copying levies;
    ●  They  would  therefore  experience   a   significant   reduction   in
      administrative charges linked to  the  management  of  exoneration  or
      reimbursements applications;
    ● Present reimbursement difficulties for  professional  users  would  be
      overcome.

For the Member States:
    ●  Competition’s  distortions  caused  by  grey  market  issues  amongst
      Member States would be avoided. As evoked in the answer to question 64
      in  point  4.,  differences  in  prices  of  storage/recording  media,
      engendered by differences in private  copying  levies  amongst  Member
      States, cause grey markets because the consumers can buy  on  internet
      sites goods at much lower prices in some Member States than in others,
      and actually do so. Member States  with  the  higher  private  copying
      levies systems, France in our example, lose both VAT  and  corporation
      taxes without mentioning the negative  impact  on  employment  brought
      about by the loss of competitiveness in certain  consumer  electronics
      markets
    ● This solution could  rapidly  lead  to  an  harmonization  of  private
      copying levies throughout Member States  as  a  number  of  prices  on
      phonograms and videograms, for instance prices on  online  music,  are
      already transnational and could all increase by the same degree.

The  solution  advocated  by  SECIMAVI  would  imply  modifications  on  the
Intellectual  Property  Laws  of  Member  States  but  we  think  that   the
simplifications and advantages  brought  about  by  this  approach  for  all
categories of stakeholders -  rightholders,  consumers,  professional  users
and Member States- are worth the effort.

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[73] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[74]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[75] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[76].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[77]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[78].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[31] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
