TYPES OF RESPONDENTS


     X   Author/Performer OR Representative of authors/performers


     X Institutional user (e.g. school, university, research centre, library, archive) OR
     Representative of institutional users


     X   Other (Please explain):
     The Anne Frank Fonds and the Stichting Charlotte Salomon both inherited copyrights
     to works by persons who died in the holocaust. They are not-for-profit organizations who
     donate all proceeds from the copyrights to charities and good causes, and who look after
     and safeguard the proper and respectful usage of the works concerned. Basically, they are
     charities as well as right holders. The Amsterdam Jewish Historical Museum is the main
     Dutch museum on the history of the Jews in Holland and as such an institutional user. The
     Stiftung Fritz Bauer Institut is an independent cultural institute. It is the oldest research
                                                                                                1

      Holocaust. It is an institutional user. However, it supports the below for ethical reasons.


E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention1 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

15.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?


X NO –they should be longer for a certain category of authors


It may not be a concern expressed before, or one that is specifically aimed at in the context of
this Consultation, but we hope to use this opportunity to draw the attention of the European
legislature to an issue in relation to the term of copyright protection that urgently needs
mending.


The term of protection to the works of those who were killed at the hand of the Nazis is
coming to an end. In 1945 the Nazis rushed to complete the so-called ‘Endlösung’ and made
their last victims whose copyrights under the general term of life plus 70 years will in most
EU countries end on 1 January 2016. This underscores the pressing nature of the matter
explained below.


Most of those who deceased in the death camps died long before their time. Clearly, however,
the term of copyright is predicated on the conviction that an author and his heirs should be
able to enjoy the fruits of the author’s creative labor for a ‘normal’ or average lifetime, plus
70 years. Those who inherited the copyrights of authors who vanished in the gas chambers are

                                                                                                                     2
deprived of this enjoyment. Thus, the murder by the Nazis of so many talented people, just
because – in the eyes of the perpetrators – they were of a particular ethnical background or
religion, or had certain ethical, political or moral convictions, constitutes a form of
expropriation.


The issue addressed here concerns the ownership of intellectual property. In many countries,
an exception to the law as regards tangible property has been inserted dealing with the
unlawful expropriation of such property in the second world war. Even if the applicable
‘normal’ property law does not allow it, for instance, because the term for instituting a claim
has expired, the heir of a person who was expropriated by the Nazis, may often still reclaim
his ancestor’s property either under ‘strict’ law, or under so-called ‘soft’ law like the
Washington Principles and the ICOM terms. A similar exception is called for where
copyrights are concerned: the term of protection must be adapted as regards works created by
those who died in the holocaust or who were otherwise put to death by the Nazis, taking into
account that they were killed long before it was their time and that, therefore, their heirs are
unjustly limited in the enjoyment of their intellectual property.


In fact, in some jurisdictions, like France and Italy, provisions with a similar aim did exist
before the EU Term Directive of 1993 was implemented. Indeed, the law of the European
Union, which, as a matter of fact, more or less coincides with the territory where the holocaust
took place, should provide the right holders to works by authors who were murdered by the
Nazis with an equal opportunity to enjoy the proceeds of such works, as it does to copyright
owners of works by authors who were not killed because they were of a certain ethnicity or
religion, or had a certain ethical, political or moral conviction.


Furthermore, whereas the moral rights in many countries can only be exercised for as long as
the copyrights have not expired, prolongation of the applicable term to those works is
necessary for the right owners to be able to ensure that the works concerned are indeed used
appropriately. Works by those singled out by the Nazis are particularly vulnerable to misuse,
as they often report on the atrocities committed during the war. For that reason too it is
important that their proper usage is safeguarded.


Under the so-called Term Directive of 1993, the term of copyright protection has become a
European matter. We therefore urgently call for the EU legislator to take into account the fact

                                                                                                   3
that right holders to works created by the victims of the holocaust are unjustly limited in the
enjoyment of their intellectual property.


In our view, several approaches are conceivable. The term of protection for works by authors
who died because of crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis could be calculated as
if they reached an average age: their creations would, for instance, be protected for 70 years
after the year that the author would have become 70. Another, perhaps more easily applicable,
alternative could be to simply add a fixed number of years of protection, causing, for instance,
the copyrights of those who died in the gas chambers to last for 50 more years after the
general term of 70 years of protection expires: instead of, for example, in 2016, the rights
would simply expire in 2066. An advantage of the latter option would be that one only needs
to know the year that a person deceased to calculate the term of protection, just as is the case
under current law.


Whichever approach is chosen, it is important that it is done very quickly, since the rights
concerned are rapidly expiring.
