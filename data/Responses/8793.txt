    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  2
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
Cross-border licensing is marginal compared to the national market. Requests for such
licences for secondary uses of already published text and image works only occur
occasionally. Nevertheless where such requests are made, publishers are licensing their
content across borders and there are no particular problems regarding such multi-territory
licensing.
Multi-territorial licensing is the main objective of a project called PDLN (Press Database and
Licensing Network), established by publishers’ rights management organisations and press
database companies). The idea is notably to take into account the needs of international users
(such as the EU institutions for instance) and provide standardised and user-friendly solutions.
PDLN was founded in 2008 by companies from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland and UK. PDLN members currently represent
over 5.000 newspapers and magazines from 13 different countries. For more details see:
http://www.pdln.info/index.htm


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
We haven’t identified any problems.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?

7
  For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing a single
title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                             3
    NO
As long as publishers can keep the control on their content.


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
    NO – Please explain
Publishers have established joint press clipping services which provide licenses for the
various uses of digital works, or which offer tailor-made services to different types of users on
a commercial basis in cross-border situations (Pressbanking).
Regarding multi-territorial licencing, the predominantly national nature of the press sector
should be duly taken into account. In Belgium, copyright management societies provide
adapted licences to cover all uses. It doesn’t matter where the demand comes from nor where
the content is used.
In the news media sector, current legislation does not serve as an impediment to the
development of multi-territorial solutions, which the European Commission itself has
confirmed previously in its Reflection Document on “Creative Content in a European Digital
Single Market: Challenges for the Future”, 22 October 2009: “The present legal framework
does not in itself prevent rightholders from commercialising their works on a multi-territory
basis” (Art 2, page 12). On the contrary, newspaper publishers are licensing their content to
commercial users in order to make their content available across borders. Commercial users
can generally license a work directly from the publisher or a collecting society or press
database to use it on a worldwide basis.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.



8
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
9
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

                                                                                                           4
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)

10
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many

                                                                                                                 5
9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     NO

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
     NO

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Publishers would like to reiterate that yes, under certain circumstances, it is subject to
authorisation. When links to newspaper content are posted with information, there is a real
risk of diverting readers from the need to read further any relevant information on the


Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

newspaper websites as such. There is also a problem with hyperlinks that allow readers to
avoid restricted area (e.g. paywall) on publishers’ websites (see Nils Svensson and Others v
Retriever Sverige AB- CJEU 13 feb. 2014) In some cases, the rightholder may wish to restrict
use of its website content and will erect a paywall to restrict access to its content to achieve
this. A paywall applies the same restriction on access to all users and should not be countered
by hyperlinks to the protected content.
Another circumstance that requires authorisation is the commercial use of hyperlinks by third
parties. News content is the “raw” material used by aggregators, press clippers,… to offer
their own services. These services could not exist if publishers didn’t finance press content.
Nevertheless, from a newspaper publishers’ point of view, the EU copyright framework gives
the above mentioned necessary protection.
This diversion of traffic also negatively impacts on advertising revenues which are related to
the number of clicks received on the newspaper website. Publishers’ content should therefore
not be used without consent beyond what is absolutely necessary for navigational purposes in
horizontal search. When search engines, news aggregators and other third parties link to
editorial content on the Internet, there is an increased risk that readers may not be motivated
to click further on to access the newspaper website, if they already received relevant
information in the extracts provided alongside the link. From a journalistic point of view, the
first lines of news article are very important because they are written to catch the attention of
the readers and provide the essence of a story which is developed in further details below
these first lines.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC clearly gives the response to this
question. Temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or
incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole
purpose is to enable:
(a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or
(b) a lawful use
of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent economic
significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2.
Everything which goes beyond this exception (and is not covered by any other exception of
paragraph 2) is protected under copyright.
It is also apparent from the recitals to Directive 2001/29/EC (e.g., recitals 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12)
that rightholders are intended to be afforded a high level of protection in respect of their
copyrighted works. Furthermore, the Directive (e.g. recitals 15 and 22) makes it clear that
copyright plays an important role in the fight against piracy.


                                                                                                7
In addition, Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29/EC makes it clear that the exception in Article
5(1) (which provides a limited exception for certain temporary copies) is not intended to
operate in a manner which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the work and/or
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
Services providers are the ones who have to take the necessary licences and pay the required
remuneration in order for users to be able to consult content in the respect of article 5 (1) and
of the 3 steps test.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
14.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
From the point of view of newspaper publishers, a legal framework enabling the resale of
previously purchased digital content would pose a severe threat to any existing and future
business models of press publishers.
If, for example, a daily newspaper which has been purchased would be resold within the same
day on a digital resale platform, readers would not buy the newspaper from the original
publisher. To apply the same principle of exhaustion of the right to control the resale in
Recital 28 to digital products would simply destroy paid for business models.
Such a resale right would certainly undermine the primary market, e.g., by negatively
impacting prices and reducing incentives to invest in newspaper content. The outcome would
ultimately negatively impact media pluralism.
19
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
20
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                                8
Ultimately it should be up to a rightholder to decide on how their content can be used by
others.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     NO
The view of new media publishers is that a registration system at EU level would create an
unnecessary administrative burden and result in an overall weakening copyright protection,
due to the inevitable assumption that only registered works would benefit from copyright
protection.
Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
Furthermore such a system would be against Article 5 paragraph 2 which clearly states that
the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality.

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                              9
D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Press publishers are ready to collaborate with each other to simplify the legal use of their
content. They already take part to PDLN (see above).
Legislative intervention of the EU is not necessary from the point of view of press publishers
in order to promote or make such systems obligatory, we would advise it to be left to the
market to continue developing the necessary tools.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
Publishers of newspapers regard the current terms of copyright protection as appropriate in
the digital environment. Publishers should have the benefits of the protection of their
intellectual property rights, also in recognition of the historical and cultural importance of
news reporting of current and past events and the vital role that newspapers play in a
democratic society.
Maintaining an appropriate duration of copyright protection is particularly important for
newspaper publishers, given the commercial value of their archives which are increasingly
part of subscription and other paid-for business models.
Newspaper publishers digitise and make available their content not only through their print
and digital editions, but also through their archives and databases on a commercial basis.
While we have much in common with the other publishing sectors, newspaper publishers
differ in our business models, with our archives having a significant commercial value. New
markets are developing all the time, for both historic and contemporary collections.

     II.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                                                                                            11
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     NO – Please explain
The current optional nature allows Member States the possibility to exercise their national
competence regarding creative and media content which, by its nature, is predominantly of
local, regional and national character. There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory
exceptions and limitations would lead to a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen by
the EU, based on optional exceptions and limitations, combined with the development of
practical solutions on a case-by-case basis to enhance harmonisation, when required and
appropriate.
This pragmatic, voluntary approach has also allowed Europe to take the lead in the
development of innovative solutions and enabled that European “IPR-intensive industries
account for more than 56 million jobs, or 26% of total employment, in the EU.”
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/intellectual-property/docs/joint-report-epo-ohim-final-
version_en.pdf, page 59.)

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
     NO – Please explain


32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           12
The current EU legislative framework provides an appropriate balance between rightholders
and users in terms of rights and exceptions to copyright. Changing this equilibrium would
jeopardise the investment of publishers in editorial content, undermine their commercial
activities and hold back the development of new business models.
The European Union model has been shaped by the various legal, cultural and historical
traditions of its Member States, which vary substantially and encompass civil law and
common law countries. This diversity of traditions poses challenges to the European Union,
but it also represents its strength. Publishers of newspapers and news media do not regard
harmonisation of exceptions and limitations to be either necessary or beneficial in the EU
context of 28 Member States with different cultural backgrounds.
In the view of publishers, the mix of elements in the EU copyright framework, is carefully
chosen to address national requirements and traditions. Flexibility can only be built on general
principles, leaving some degree of discretion to the Member States.
Exceptions and limitations in national legislation are subject to compliance with the three-step
test of the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD Article 5.5, and adapted to the special needs
and legal and other traditions of the individual Member State. In the EU, this general principle
is combined with a mandatory and several optional exceptions and limitations. We do not see
how more detailed norms on a Community level could serve the purpose of improved
access to copyright works or enhanced competitiveness in a changing technological and
media environment.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
NO. Any further limitation or exceptions would cause a serious risk to publishers existing
business models and to the development of new digital business models. This would
ultimately lead to a threat to publishers’ ability to continue fulfilling their democratic mission
in society and also place media diversity at risk. Furthermore, any reform of the EU copyright
framework should certainly not include the introduction into European copyright law of an
American-style general fair use provision.
Publishers of newspapers and news media are strongly opposed to the introduction of a “fair
use” provision into EU copyright framework. Such a provision is open to misuse in a way
which ultimately undermines the investments of rightholders. In our view, a “fair use”
provision is wholly unnecessary in the context of the EU copyright framework which already
provides for a comprehensive list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.
Furthermore, the widely differing interpretation of what “fair use” actually means inevitably
creates legal uncertainty. The United States experience shows that such a provision favours
those who have the resources to litigate. The actual scope and meaning of “fair use” in the
U.S. is therefore still being defined by case law.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  NO – Please explain why



                                                                                               13
Newspaper publishers would like to stress that the optionality of exceptions and limitations in
the EUCD already provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. EU legislation already allows
for a comprehensive list of exceptions to copyright.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
In general, in respect of licensing of newspaper content, the territoriality of limitations and
exceptions does not constitute particular problems. User requests related to rights are to a
large extent confined to uses and users within the territory of one member state. Demands for
cross-border or multi-territory licensing are limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on the
basis of the current models of operation.
As set out in previous questions, the flexibility provided by the Directive, which allows for
the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, is important in order for the copyright
framework to meet the needs of individual member states, taking into account Europe’s
cultural diversity.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
As for current exceptions (e.g. reprography) the RRO in charge of perception and payment of
fair remuneration to local rightsholders should also be in charge of remunerating rightsholders
abroad for the uses of their works under the exception.

A.         Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or

limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     NO
Respect for copyright and fair competition are essential preconditions for publishers’
continued investment in the wide range of quality content to inform European citizens.
Archiving newspapers should only be done with an aim to preserve European cultural
heritage. As long as libraries respect the conditions of archiving, limited to preservation (no
exploitation) we do not see any problem.


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
As of today our members don’t have any agreements of this type.
Publishers are ready to let libraries provide remote access but conform to their terms and
conditions. Guarantees are needed in order to safeguard publishers’ business models notably
based on paid-for offers regarding archives.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Newspaper publishers are not aware of any problems. However, it is important that this sort of
remote access is agreed in a licensing agreement – and not in legislation - and does not
prejudice right holders’ exploitation of their own content.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
Publishers do not think that a legislative solution is needed.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]




                                                                                           16
3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     NO
Newspaper publishers are not aware of digital newspapers being lent out, including in cross-
border situations.

37.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
We are not aware of any specific problems at present as regards newspapers. However, it is
particularly important that terms of any e-lending activities are agreed contractually in
advance between libraries etc. and rightholders.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
Any off-premises consultation of newspapers content via a library poses a severe risk to the
business models of newspapers. People would then not subscribe, buy or consult websites or
apps of newspapers any longer. It is therefore essential that such uses continue to be agreed
individually between publishers and libraries.
Large access to news content through libraries would lead to a loss of control by publishers on
their content. Publishers would not be able to monetize it anymore. News content would be
subject to multiple reuses since the quality of any reproduction stays the same as the original.

                                                                                             17
4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     NO – Please explain
The mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies may
represent a risk to publishers’ ability to develop new business models in the digital
environment, and to monetise their content.
The main focus in the 2011 MOU was on books since the newspaper sector functions in an
entirely different way and newspapers digitise and make available “old” content through their
online archives and databases on a commercial basis. It is rather difficult to define out of
commerce works for press.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     NO – Please explain
Mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies represents
a considerable risk to publishers’ ability to make contractual agreements with their partners,

36
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             18
in order to monetise their content and therefore ensure that their titles can remain sustainable
in both the print and digital environment.
Providing new mechanisms for mass-digitisation would represent a direct threat to publishers’
economic sustainability and their ability to respond adequately to the digital challenges.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     NO
We are not aware of any specific problem. However, newspaper publishers understand the
exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a narrow exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at
enabling exactly what it states: to illustrate; which is far from being the same as planned
producing of teaching material. Teaching material in whatever format, including multiple
copying for classroom use, cannot and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it
would definitely undermine the normal exploitation of these works. Therefore any broadening
of the existing exception would seriously undermine business models of publishers and
existing licensing solutions.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Regarding illustration and teaching, licensing agreements are the most pragmatic way forward
in addressing problems, rather than e.g., legislation.
Furthermore, newspaper publishers feel that the licensing agreements have a firm societal
advantage regarding the value of content. Licensing demonstrates to consumers that creative
works and content have a value and that using works that are created and owned by others
thus require their authorisation or license. In addition, newspaper publishers remain very
active in media literacy programmes at educational establishments covering all age groups.

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Publishers of newspapers have been pioneers in promoting the use of content for teaching
purposes. The role of news media publishers in improving media literacy through various
programmes, particularly in schools, was recognized in the 2009 European Commission
Recommendation on media literacy (2009/625/CE).

Publishers have been active for many years at national level developing “Newspaper in
Education” programme in primary and secondary schools. They delivered to schools
newspapers and educational tools

Due to the efforts of publishers, news media content in both print and digital formats plays an
essential role in teaching programs that focus on the ability of citizens to inform themselves
and to analyse current social, political and economic developments.

Our programme “Ouvrir mon quotidien” provides newspapers and educational tools to 80%
of secondary schools and 70% of classes in the last degree of primary schools.

In the digital era, this project has shown to be really helpful to media users to develop
understanding of how and why media content is produced and to evaluate the trustworthiness
of different sources. This program both help young people approach media content,
distinguish between fact and opinion, and between editorial and advertising, as well as
teaching them how to create their own press content.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open

States level.

academic institutions for the purposes of scientific research, often for a minimal fee.



D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
    NO
Exceptions and limitations in favour of persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise
print disabled, exist in all EU Member States. Also, publishers offer licensing agreements to
facilitate access to copyright published works for those user groups.
Exceptions for persons with disabilities, especially for Visually Impaired Persons and Persons
with Print Disabilities, are included in national copyright law and correctly applied in
Belgium.
Publishers are aware of many barriers to access to information experienced by persons who
have partial vision and who have print disabilities. Publishers support the goal that visually
impaired persons/persons with print disabilities have access to information. Some publishers
offer, on a voluntary basis, specific tools to enable visually impaired persons to consult their
website.
The main challenge is linked to the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. The
WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually
Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled, will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the
cross-border exchange of such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come into
force and be implemented in national legislation.
Publishers believe that any initiative in this field should be focused directly on improving
accessibility, fully taking into account the national character of copyright law in the Member
States and ensuring that the accessible format copy is used exclusively by beneficiary persons.
Such an instrument must remain fair in its application to commercially available newspaper
content, with the prior authorisation of the rightholder.
Newspaper publishers are involved and/or are open to discussions and voluntary agreements
with Authorised Entities and other stakeholders at national level in order to find balanced
voluntary partnerships and agreements, which enable the Authorised Entities to fulfill their
mission, while at the same time respecting copyright legislation and not undermining
publishers’ commercial activities with respect to their content.
Publishers believe that the appropriate solution to provide newspaper content for the print
disabled is not more legislation, but cooperation and licensing on a voluntary basis for
between publishers and Authorised Entities, as is already the case in a number of Member
States.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
    NO – Please explain
Publishers of newspapers and news media have not experienced specific problems from the
use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, when TDM access is
provided for scientific research purposes via licensing models developed by publishers or the
licensing organisations with whom they work.

There is, however, serious potential for problems resulting from the use of text and data
mining in relation to copyright protected content, in cases there would be an exception for
TDM access to newspapers archives.

In the first place, publishers should retain the right to decide how their content may or may
not be re-used by others. It is vital for the long-term sustainability of the publishing that the
end results of any research do not become a substitute for the published content. This would
inevitably jeopardise continued investment by publishers in authoritative content, which in
turn helps to promote advances in research.

Secondly, especially since many publishing houses are small and medium-sized enterprises,
TDM access has to be a managed process in order to avoid disruption of the different
platforms used by publishers. In this context, it is important that potential miners continue to
engage with publishers to achieve the best outcome for their research, given that the different
platforms used by publishers have different capabilities. It is necessary to avoid any potential
disruption or degradation to these platforms, which may happen when unmanaged mining
takes place without publisher support.

Publishers already are licensing TDM access to their archives, for example to linguists for
language research. However, it is important for publishers that this is done on a case by case
basis as publishers have to agree on the specific use of the outcome of the research. Even if
such research is not done for commercial use it can have implications on potential newspaper
business models if e.g. certain material would be made public even though the newspaper
could have exploited this information. Furthermore, newspapers have to be able to carefully
manage how much of their archives they can give to researchers and in what format, in order
to prevent massive abuse or loss of their archives. Therefore any exception could lead to
serious risks for publishers’ businesses.

Thirdly, from the perspective of press publishers, any potential exception for TDM could be
misused by news aggregators and media monitoring companies in order to avoid the necessity
of licensing their activities.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated




45
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           25
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     NO
As long as the generated content is really new and does not reproduce, event partly (except if
covered by the exception of quotation) protected works we do not see any problem. They can
only get inspired from the protected works to feed their personal creative effort. If a
reproduction of a protected work is envisaged the publishers’ rights management company
already grants the needed licences. Current exceptions (quotation,…) already allow users to
generate their own new content inspired by existing protected works without harming the
normal exploitation of the protected works.
59.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use?
NO
Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
YES, proprietary systems are sufficient. Where users want to submit content to publishers for
publication, publishers provide for terms and conditions, which set out the uses the publishers
may undertake with the shared content, should they choose to provide their content.
Publishers are increasingly promoting awareness of such terms and conditions.
Engaging with UGC in some capacity is now part of the daily business of publishing for many
publishing houses, with this two-way dialogue being beneficial for both publishers and users.
By facilitating easier access to their content for users, this allows publishers to enjoy much
closer contact with their readership.
Specifically, press publishers are keen to facilitate and promote users’ access to content,
participation and interaction by adopting tools to provide comments, upload photos, and share
links in social media and elsewhere. This approach is very much at the heart of the press in
today’s digital environment. For example, press publishers are increasingly choosing to
provide “share” & “recommend” buttons and encourage users to share professional press
content with others, with a variety of new platforms offering easy ways of doing so. They
clear, as required, rights relating to the various contributors to their content in order to enable
such use by users.
As long as publishers keep control of the uses allowed there is no risk for their sustainability.

61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As set out above, newspaper publishers use licensing solutions. We do not perceive UGC as a
problem as such as long as terms and conditions for reuse are respected. The need for any
legislative action in this field to e.g., introduce an exception, has not been proven.
It should be noted in light of discussions about what UGC means, that it is important to
distinguish between new original work created by a “non-professional” and existing works
which such a person either “copies”, or reuses, or “adapts” for the purposes of publishing a
new composite work. It is important that the public is properly educated about these
distinctions.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
Newspaper publishers do not see the need for a legislative initiative regarding UGC. Current
licensing schemes are sufficient as long as the users enter the system and respect it.

63.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Press publishers who are contacted by users wishing to use their content typically provide
licences for use of the content. UGC should be left to contractual solutions.



 III.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and

                                                                                            27
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions50 in the digital environment?
     NO – Please explain
The scope is clearly defined. Belgian implementation of these EU rules works satisfactorily
for rightsholders. The dual system enforced for reprography is key for ensuring a correct
compensation of the rightholders’ prejudice (including publishers’).

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?51


     YES

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

with online services (e.g. cloud computing). However we are of the view that the levies
system and its organization have to be decided at national level.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?52
     NO – Please explain

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53. Furthermore it would create unnecessary burden.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
     NO OPINION

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
x

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     NO – Please explain why
Publishers of newspaper and news media believe that it is important to emphasise that respect
for the freedom to contract and to negotiate should be the fundamental basis to any approach
to this area. For ENPA, a cross-sectoral and pan-European approach to employment practice
in the press sector would represent a real threat to the freedom to contract.
To sum up, publishers of newspapers and news media do not see any competence for any EU
action in the field of copyright contract law. Any approach at EU level would contravene the
principle of subsidiarity and would not respect national legislation already in place in the
different sub-categories of contract law and in the different sectors and would not respect the
freedom to contract.

     V.        Respect for rights


54
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
55
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                            30
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
A well-functioning IP protection and enforcement system is vital if Europe is to achieve the
full potential of a single digital market that delivers jobs, growth and delivers quality content
for consumers.
Infringements of intellectual property rights cause real economic harm to the newspaper
publishing sector and hold back its potential for re-investment and growth. In view of the
current Consultation, and considering the opportunities but also challenges that the Internet
continues to present, it is very important for newspaper publishers to be able to rely on
quantitative research on the sector. In our view, this should include an examination of the
economic impact on publishers’ investments as well as the financial impact and long-term
consequences for society of unauthorised use of content by third parties, including
aggregators, search engines and private companies, often for commercial gain.
Efficient enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to a well-functioning
intellectual property (IP) system. Well-functioning IPR enforcement mechanisms are the best
means to fight against counterfeiting and piracy, make sure that right holders and the society
as a whole can fully enjoy the benefits of the IP system and protect consumersʼ rights in their
purchasing decisions.
Another crucial element is that the different procedures should be launched at a more
reasonable cost than today.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright

   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           31
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Infringements of intellectual property rights in both the print and digital environment must be
addressed and for that matter, a closer cooperation between all authorities and actors involved,
including intermediaries, is necessary. The implementation of the Enforcement Directive
should ensure coherence with the relevant provisions of the E-Commerce directive including
liability exemptions.
Press publishers have been concerned with the important question how two essential legal
pillars for technology-neutral press can be safeguarded on the public Internet. The digital
press requires both effective copyright protection, which includes the possibility of practical
enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press products or parts thereof, as well
as effective freedom of the press.
Newspaper publishers are of the opinion that the judicial authority should be the one, who can
balance different rights and freedoms concerned, including freedom of expression. Control of
press content by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would be considered as censorship and
therefore would pose a threat to digital press freedom.
However judicial authorities should be ready to act quickly and in low cost procedures in
order to involve ISP’s in cases where copyright infringement could be efficiently treated at
their level or when ISP’s are the ones able to help the publishers to contact efficiently the
infringer.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
It is important to underline the right balance between the fundamental right of freedom of
expression and effective copyright protection online, which includes the possibility of
practical enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press content.
A necessary precondition to enforce copyright is an effectively enforceable right of
information to identify the name and address of the infringer and also in case of dynamic IP
addresses. In case of copyright infringements of newspapers content, it is necessary to ensure
that judicial decisions can be adequately enforced and respected.
The Enforcement Directive has provided a broadly harmonised civil framework in Europe
regarding IPR infringements. It has been an important and necessary tool for publishers.
However, uniform implementation of the Directive should be ensured, as divergencies among
Member States still exist. ENPA and its members have not identified any specific problems
with regard to the Enforcement Directive, but with certain aspects of implementation of the
current text of the Directive.
- The right balance between the content control of Internet access providers and the digital
freedom of press should be assured.
- Enforcement measures of the Directive are complicated, costly and timely.




                                                                                             32
Not enough consideration has been given by the EU legislator to the interaction between data
protection rules and implementation of the Enforcement Directive, which leads to
inconsistencies and, in some cases, total lack of remedies for IP rights at national level. This
should be rectified in order to ensure that rightholders are not deprived of effective remedies
whenever their rights are infringed.
- Measures, procedures and remedies shall not be unnecessary complicated or costly, or entail
unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays.
(Article 3§1 re. General obligation of the Directive) However, some cases at national level
(ex: Copiepresse v. Google) reveal that procedures might be delayed due to courts having an
overload of cases to address, which therefore has an effect on the enforcement of the rights
infringed and could be to the advantage the infringer.
- The situation regarding damages awarded by the courts could be improved.
Damages awards often are not effectively deterring potential infringers from engaging in
illegal activities, particularly because the damages awarded by courts fail to match the level of
potential profit made by such infringements.

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  NO
In respect of the copyright legal framework, the EU should continue to pursue a pragmatic
approach. Rather than emphasising on a single EU Copyright Title, the focus should be on the
adoption of an overall IPR strategy, especially given that the IPR intensive industries
contribute over one third of EU’s GDP and 90% of EU’s export comes from IP intensive
industries.
Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources and unnecessarily
distract focus from the important work on an overall EU IP strategy. Also, it is difficult to see
how it could be established on the basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The
different traditions and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit
from being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst EU Member
States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is difficult to see that an overarching EU
Copyright Title is required.
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?


                                                                                               33
[Open question]
NO
Publishers of newspapers and news media believe that the WIPO Treaty and BERNE
Convention, together with CJEU case law, already provides an important degree of
harmonisation in the copyright field.
