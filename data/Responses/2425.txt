   Academic working in the field of intellectual property law and policy providing evidence to
the consultation in a personal capacity – for the purposes of clarity, I have only included in this
submission the questions I have been able to answer within the time constraints of the
consultation, rather than all questions.
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?

     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to
        access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?

    YES

While improving, access to digital media within the EU is still subject to territorial restrictions, even
with regard to services offered in each Member State (such as the iTunes Music Store). Access to
national television services such as the BBC iPlayer continue to be subject to territorial restrictions, as
are commercially run services. Furthermore, there can be territorial restrictions on the availability of
content provided legally such as music videos on YouTube, as the result of licensing restrictions.


     4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be
        the best way to tackle them?

One potential way of ensuring pan-European access to online services would be the establishment of a
common or unitary Copyright Code creating a common copyright title applicable to the entire EU. EU
law-making in this field has focused on the approximation of national copyright regimes, with the
result that territoriality and national applicability of copyright laws remain barriers to the realisation of
a ‘digital’ single market for copyright-protected works. Through the establishment of a ‘European’
copyright that is not based on principles of territoriality and is not subject to divergent laws, barriers to
trade in copyrighted works can be removed. This is an approach recommended by Professor
Hugenholtz of IViR and Professor Hargreaves of Cardiff University1. Similarly, Drexl et al2, agreed
that the Commission’s current proposal for collective rights management reform would be hindered by
nationally applicable copyright laws. Nevertheless, given the operation of collective rights
management organisations (CMROs) as territorially restricted national actors, there would need to be
reform to the current system of collective rights management. The creation of a unitary Copyright
Code combined with a system of Extended Collective Licensing as seen in Scandinavia and recently
legislated for in the UK under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 would assist in
simplifying the European licensing system for digital works. The possibility of a Central Licensing
Authority for collective rights in the European Union should be considered as a potential means of
facilitating pan-European licensing.

     5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
        reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
        question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a
        service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not
        possible in certain European countries)?

    YES –

for a Directive on Collective Rights Management of Copyright and Related Rights and Multi-Territory Licensing of Rights
in Musical Works for Online Uses in the Internal Market’, Research Paper 13-04
A predominant argument in favour of the current system of territorial licensing is based in the
principles of reciprocity and solidarity amongst members of a CRMO3. Individual composers and
performers are at a significant disadvantage compared to large transnational corporate actors involved
in the licensing and using of rights. In particular, any solution to cross-border licensing issues needs to
ensure avoidance of a ‘race to the bottom’ in collective rights management. Such an approach may
have substantial detrimental effects on both individual composers and musicians, and potentially
impact upon the EU’s cultural diversity4. Nevertheless, the current system of territorial restrictions is
unsatisfactory, and a way of simplifying cross-border licensing is desirable. For this reason, one
solution that may help to both facilitate cross-border licensing and ensure the protection of artists
could be the establishment of an EU Central Licensing Authority, which has as one of its clear
objectives the assurance of respect for the notion of solidarity between creative artists. The creation of
a centralised system by way of a European agency is supported by a submission by the Max Planck
Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law5, which argued that contrary to the view
expressed by the Commission that this method would be more anti-competitive than other proposed
solutions6, a centralised system leads to increased efficiency in the market for copyright licensing, as
collective rights management constitutes a form of natural monopoly7, a view supported by many other
academics that study CRMOs8. Furthermore, by trying to increase competition in this area, the
Commission appears to have had the effect of increasing fragmentation of repertoires9. By creating a
European licensing agency, ‘one-stop’ licensing may be achieved, bringing down territorial restrictions
and facilitating the cross-border sale of digital works.


      7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
         solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services
         in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

    YES –

As stated above the main hindrances of cross-border licensing are the result of territorial copyright
laws (and the inconsistencies and incompatibilities of the national system), combined with the overly
complex licensing systems (both existing and proposed in the Proposal for a Directive on Collective
Rights Management of Copyright and Related Rights and Multi-Territory Licensing of Rights in

Authority would help to ensure certainty in EU copyright law, while maintaining protection both for
right holders and individual creative artists.


B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

     8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
        disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

 NO –

The position on ‘making available’ in the EU in cross-border situations is far from clear. While, as
indicated, there is a growing body of CJEU case law on the subject of where the act of ‘making
available’ takes place, there are still questions that need to be addressed. The Football Dataco case10
does give some guidance on this issue, indicating that adopting a ‘country of origin’ approach would
be difficult to achieve due to the problem of effectively identifying the locality of a server11. In
particular, this would cause problems where the server used for dissemination would be located
outside of the EU. The Court therefore suggested that the approach that should be taken would be to
take a ‘targeting’ approach ‘at least’12, considering the making available to be taking place at least in
the Member State that is the target of the dissemination. However, this ‘at least’ leads to potential
jurisdictional issues, according to Professor Jane Ginsburg, and questions as to whose law will apply
(i.e. the country of origin where the alleged infringer is ostensibly located, or the country which is
targeted?) 13 . A 2013 Report commissioned by the Commission also determined that there is
significant uncertainty in how the making available right is to be applied, leading to divergence
between Member States in its application14. Furthermore, this would also complicate the licensing of
works, as has been discussed with regard to licensing in cross-border contexts more generally. It is
once again submitted that a unitary copyright code for the EU may go some way to addressing this
issue. If it is possible to establish a single ‘European copyright’ and the facilitation of a single market
for digital works, then these issues are more easily resolved. As stated earlier, the creation of a single
market for digital works and the establishment of a Central Licensing Authority would ensure ease of
licensing that would not need to rely upon a country of origin or targeting model, as a license granted
by this authority would be applicable to the entire EU area. With regard to infringement, by having a
common copyright area within the EU territory subject to a common copyright code, courts would not
have to determine whether a country of origin or targeting model of making available is applicable, as
making available in one Member State would be akin to making available in all Member States.
Divergences in law caused by different applications of Article 5 of the Information Society Directive
would also be addressed by a copyright code and creation of a single copyright area, reducing the
potential for inconsistent applications of the law in this area.

     9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the
        “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
        are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your

        rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
        availability of injunctive relief)?

 YES –

While there may be an effect on the recognition of rights through the creation of a copyright code and
Central Licensing Authority, it is in fact possible that this effect will be beneficial, rather than
detrimental. A simplified system for determining the rights held over a work, and by extension, a
simplified system for identifying the right-holder, is likely to improve the quality of data and evidence-
gathering in order to support a claim of being the recognised right-holder over a particular work.


     10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights
         to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
         problems for you?

 YES –

One problem caused by the existence of two separate rights connected to one economic act is the
added complexity of cross-border licensing. The division of rights between ‘performance’ and
‘reproduction’ rights entails seeking multiple licenses to make the same piece of music available for
licensed sale in one single Member State. This fragmentation of rights, combined with the need to
gain one or more licenses to cover both reproduction and performance in 28 Member States leads to a
significant barrier to the facilitation of cross-border licensing of music15. For this reason, again a
centralized European agency, such as a Central Licensing Authority would help to simplify licensing.
This body could license both the performance and reproduction rights on a pan-European basis in a
form of ‘one-stop’ licensing. Alternatively, as part of the reform of copyright law and the creation of a
unitary copyright code, these two rights could be subsumed into a general ‘right of making digitally
available’ or ‘digital exploitation’ right, as a way of bundling these two rights for online exploitation,
which could then be managed by the Central Licensing Authority. However, should such a body be
provided with the authority to manage both types of right, this bundling may not be necessary.


     11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
         copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
         of the rightholder?

 NO –

There have been a number of cases in national courts concerning the issue of hyperlinking and
copyright. These cases have tended towards considering the act of hyperlinking as not constituting an
infringement of copyright, and not an act requiring the authorisation of the right-holder. For example,
in Germany the Paperboy case16, it was determined that the act of hyperlinking does not constitute an
act of communication for the purposes of the Information Society Directive, but instead ‘only refers to
the work in a manner which facilitates the access already provided’17. According to Klein, ‘a
hyperlink does not reproduce the work itself but was just considered by the court being an electronic

connection to the linked website’ 18 . In the Netherlands the courts found similarly, stating in
Dagbladen19 that ‘adding a (deep) link to from the website kranten.com to the (reports and articles on
the) websites of the papers published by the Newspapers cannot be regarded as a reproduction of these
works’20. In Denmark the case of Home v Ofir21determined that ‘it should be an ordinary practice that
search engines make available deep links which allow the user to access the required information in an
effective manner. Parties, including providers in the Internet, should thus expect that search services
will establish links to these pages which are published’22. Perhaps most importantly, the Commission
itself has approved of this approach to hyperlinking, stating in its First Report on the application of the
E-Commerce Directive23 that it was

‘encouraging that recent case-law in the Member States recognizes the importance of linking and
search engines to the functioning of the internet. In general, this case-law appears to be in line with the
Internal Market objective to ensure the provision of basic intermediary services, which promotes the
development of the internet and e-commerce’24.

The act of hyperlinking on the Internet is an essential technical function that allows for information to
be located and for webpages and other media to connect to each other. Timothy Berners-Lee has
described the act of hyperlinking being akin to referencing or footnoting25. Making each act of
hyperlinking subject to prior authorisation is neither feasible, nor proportionate, and would have a
significantly detrimental impact on the functioning of the Internet in the EU area, with knock-on
effects for cultural dissemination and business. The Svensson26 decision finds similarly, albeit stating
that the act of hyperlinking does not constitute communication to a ‘new’ public27. In the event of a
unitary code, the Commission should stipulate that hyperlinking is explicitly exempt from the
requirement of authorisation from the right-holder, so long as it does not involve the direct
circumvention of restrictions such as a paywall.

     12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work
         or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of
         the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
         authorisation of the rightholder?

  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

The answer to this question is the same as above – hyperlinking, and the viewing of the linked
webpages, are essential functions of the Internet, and should be generally perceived as exempt from
the requirement of authorisation from the right-holder. Furthermore, the temporary reproduction on-
screen and in the cache memory should be considered as falling within the exception listed in Article
5(1) of the Information Society Directive.



C.       How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

                  19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
                  the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
                  ownership and permissions databases?

The answer to this question relates to the answers given to the above questions – it is submitted that
the most effective solution for ensuring identification of right-holders, and promoting the development
and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases is in the creation of a common
copyright area through the creation of a unitary copyright code, further facilitated by a Central
Licensing Authority which can act as a central repository of all right-holder information, and a central
licensing point.


D.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?

                  20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
                  environment?

NO –

It is submitted that the term of copyright protection is too long. There have been numerous studies on
copyright terms in the digital environment, particularly with regard to the term of protection for sound
recordings, modified by Directive 2011/77/EU. These studies have included the Gowers Reviews28 in
the UK, and the IViR Study 29 from the University of Amsterdam, both of which rejected the
suggestion that the term of protection of sound recordings should be extended beyond its (then) 50
years. The IViR Study concluded that there was little in the way of economic evidence supporting an
extension in the term of copyright30, a view shared by Gowers, who recommended that the term not be
extended31. One principle argument is that the majority of recorded works have little in the way of
commercial value after 50 years, and that copyright protection after this period serves only to ‘lock up’
commercially unviable works while presenting no material benefit to composers and performers.
Academic opinion was almost universally critical of this extension32. It is therefore submitted that the

extension of the term of protection for audio-visual works should not be considered, while the term of
protection for sound recordings should be subject to a reduction in term.

With regard to the term of protection more generally, there has been research conducted into the
optimal duration of copyright. Landes and Posner have argued that a registration based system in
which an initial term of protection of 20 years is granted, and indefinite renewals permitted subject to
registration and renewal fees. In such a system, only works of significant commercial value would
continue to be registered, allowing for works of lesser commercial value to enter into the public
domain earlier33. Economist Rufus Pollock similarly has argued that the optimal duration of copyright
is approximately 15 years, which would potentially increase overall social welfare34. While this may
not be feasible due to international obligations under the Berne Convention and WIPO Treaties, it may
nevertheless be possible to reduce the term of protection to ‘Life plus 50 years’ for copyright protected
works, and to 50 years from publication for neighbouring rights works such as phonograms. This
would have a range of benefits such as reducing licensing fees for institutions such as libraries and
helping to preserve cultural heritage, while not significantly impacting upon the economic interests of
right holders in the majority of cases.

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the
      EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 YES –

It appears to be generally accepted that despite the intent of the Information Society Directive being
harmonising legislation, it did little to harmonise the approach of the Member States with regard to the
exceptions and limitations to copyright, something reiterated frequently in academic literature 35,
studies commissioned by the European Commission on the implementation of the Information Society
Directive 36 , and indeed in the European Commission’s own assessment of the Directive’s
implementation in the Member States37. Article 5 of the Directive provides an exhaustive, yet optional
list of limitations and exceptions to copyright that Member States may pick and choose from (with the
exception of the mandatory exception under Article 5(1)). The principle problem that this causes is
that this has resulted in significant divergence between Member States concerning the limitations and
exceptions that are permitted, and how restrictively these limitations and exceptions should be applied.
This divergence in approaches and resultant legal uncertainty is likely to have a significant impact on

may be considered to be infringing in some Member States.

     22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
         level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES –

In order to facilitate cross-border trade and ensure legal certainty, if the Information Society Directive
is to be retained, then all exceptions and limitations under Article 5 should be made mandatory.
Hugenholtz and Senftleben argue that one way of ensuring that the exceptions and limitations to
copyright are appropriate for the 21st Century and rapid technological change is ensuring maximum
flexibility at the EU level, which can be facilitated by ‘literal transposition of the Directive’s entire
catalogue of exception prototypes into national law’ 38 . This could be achieved either by an
amendment to the Information Society Directive making the entirety of Article 5 mandatory, or
alternatively by the creation of a common copyright area and unitary copyright code akin to that
proposed by the Wittem Group. The Wittem Group European Copyright Code contains a more open
set of limitations under its own Article 5, which would include certain types of conduct not requiring
approval or remuneration of right holders such as making backups of lawfully obtained works, and
those that may be subject to a requirement of reasonable remuneration such as use in scientific
research39. Article 5(3) also specifically permits use without authorisation in cases where the use is to
benefit disabled persons, which is directly related to the disability and of a non-commercial nature. An
example of this would be the permitting of ‘text-to-speech’ capabilities for visually-impaired users or
those with dyslexia without the need to breach technological prevention measures to do so, or digital
subtitle files that can be added to works to make them accessible to aurally-impaired users. This type
of limitation should without doubt be made mandatory in all EU Member States, yet Guibault notes
that this limitation has been incorporated and applied very differently by different Member States40.


     23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
         catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

One particular act was not included in the Information Society Directive, namely that of adaptation.
The right of adaptation is regarded as being unregulated at the EU level41. Different forms of
adaptation may include translation, or the use of copyright protected works in the creation of new
works – remixing or ‘mash-ups’, for example, where two or more different songs are reworked into a
single piece. The Commission should consider incorporating a limitation for adaptation in limited
circumstances that includes allowing for users to remix or mash-up protected works, without the need
for remuneration in cases in which the new work is not intended for commercial for-profit distribution,
and reasonable remuneration in instances where there is an intent to commercially exploit the work for

     24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
         flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

 YES –

There are two main reasons for providing a greater degree of flexibility in the application of the
limitations and exceptions to copyright in the EU. The first is that flexibility allows for adaptability.
As copyright laws have become more restrictive, with rights becoming broader and limitations
narrower, there has been a growing body of literature that considers that this has the potential to hinder
the creation of new works that can contribute to both cultural diversity and the economy while also
depleting the public domain42. Hugenholtz & Senftleben argue that the current rigidity of copyright
law makes it less able to anticipate and respond to technological change43, while Carrier argues that
copyright has had a substantial impact on innovation44. In a series of interviews conducted with the
heads of technology firms and venture capitalists in the US (where fair use already arguably provides
for more flexibility than the current EU approach to copyright exceptions and limitations), Carrier
found that these firms talked of copyright’s “chilling effect”, with firms’ legal representatives seeking
to mitigate risk by advising against products that may have the possibility of infringing (or could be
alleged to facilitate infringing) copyright 45 , or threats of lawsuits by right-holders resulted in
innovation-based firms making settlements and ceasing development of certain technologies46. Similar
statements could be made about the EU position, in which new technologies that are potentially of
benefit to Internet users (and, theoretically, economically beneficial) fall foul of copyright laws, such
as in the Innoweb case47. In Innoweb it was determined that the use of a meta-search engine as a way
of searching on and retrieving data from multiple search engines could infringe upon the database
right48. In other words, using one website to search for listings on other websites matching certain
criteria, and then providing a link to where that information could be viewed was considered to be
unauthorised reutilisation, and therefore contrary to the Database Directive. It has been argued that
this decision could make it more difficult to run price comparison websites such as Skyscanner, which
provides user with the ability to browse flights by price and location unless specific licensing and
authorisation are received, which may be difficult to achieve in cases where one particular firm has
reason to believe that their prices may compare unfavourably49.

Secondly, copyright law and policy in the EU is increasingly the subject of media and public scrutiny.
This can be seen from the Europe-wide street protests and petitioning of the European Parliament over
the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, with European Parliament President Martin Schulz
admitting that ‘the mobilisation of public opinion was unprecedented’50. European Union citizens
protesting the agreement appeared to be predominantly concerned over a restrictive approach to

copyright that is perceived as being legislated for in ways that bring into question the transparency and
legitimacy of law making procedures51. The more restrictive copyright is perceived to be by European
Unions citizens, and the less they feel they can rely upon the exceptions and limitations to copyright,
the more likely that copyright law will be viewed as lacking legitimacy by user groups. One possible
means of addressing user concerns would be through greater flexibility in the application of these
exceptions and limitations.

     25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
         national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
         Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open
         norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
         disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
         Internal Market.

It is submitted that a combined approach may be necessary in order to provide for flexibility. A key
element is the need to ensure both consistency between Member States when it comes to the
implementation of the exceptions and limitations and a reasonable degree of flexibility in how they are
to be applied. Interpretation through national or CJEU alone is not a particularly desirable approach,
given that current CJEU jurisprudence currently provides for a significantly restrictive approach to
exceptions and limitations52. For example, the Infopaq decision53 where it was determined that
exceptions to copyright constitute ‘a derogation from the general principle established by that
directive, namely the requirement of authorisation from the rightholder for any reproduction of a
protected work’54. Subsequent cases such as Painer55 and TV2 Danmark56 have both further limited
the ability of Member States to apply the exceptions and limitations flexibly, stating that they must be
interpreted strictly57 and that Member States may not ‘alter the scope of the exceptions and limitations
that they have decided to transpose into their national regimes’58. With CJEU jurisprudence indicating
that interpretation of the exceptions and limitations to copyright should be construed narrowly, leaving
it to the CJEU or national course to ensure flexibility does not appear to currently be a viable
approach.

Instead, a mixed approach may be more suitable. Indeed, a significant element of the Infopaq decision
was the understanding of the Court that exceptions should be regarded as being applicable only in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work under Article 5(5)
(also known as the ‘three-step test’) of the Information Society Directive59, and that any derogation
from ‘general principles’ should be interpreted restrictively60. This means that even if an act falls
under one of the exceptions in Article 5, it may nevertheless be prohibited by virtue of Article 5(5).
‘Normal exploitation of the work that does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
right holder’ is a significantly broad and ambiguous phrasing which has been interpreted as a means of
limiting the exceptions and limitations by the CJEU; in comparison, Hugenholtz and Senftleben argue

that the test was in fact intended at the international level as a means of ensuring the flexible
application of exceptions61. At the very least Article 5(5) should be modified to indicate the intention
that it be applied in a way that allows for sufficient leeway in the application of exceptions and
limitations rather than to restrict acts that may otherwise be permitted under Article 5, in addition to
making all exceptions and limitations in Article 5 mandatory rather than optional. This would to
achieve both flexibility and a more harmonious approach to the exceptions and limitations in each of
the Member States. A preferred option, however, would be the establishment of a common copyright
area through a unitary copyright code, with a more balanced approach to exceptions and limitations as
advocated by the Wittem Group.


  26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
      a problem?
 YES –

As indicated above, the key problem caused by territoriality is the barrier it creates to cross-border
trade and dissemination of copyrighted works in the European Union. When each Member State is
subject to different exceptions and limitations to copyright, interpreted and applied differently, it
results in legal uncertainty. It also leads to potential legal issues concerning the application of
exceptions and limitations in cross-jurisdictional infringement disputes – as has been discussed above
with regard to the making available right, if there is an attempt to rely upon Article 5 in light of an
allegation of an unauthorised making available, should the exceptions and limitations applicable be
those permitted in the country of origin, or the targeted country, or both? On that basis, if one of the
countries has incorporated the right, will this constitute a valid defence, or must the exception have
been incorporated into the law of both Member States before it can be relied upon? A unification of
the rules concerning exceptions and limitations to copyright should therefore be considered as a means
of mitigating these problems.


     27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-
         border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
         compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

I believe that the establishment of a Central Licensing Authority which acts as a central compliance,
monitoring and licensing body would be perhaps the most effective way of allocating ‘fair
compensation’. In this system, as the EU would constitute one single market for copyright
exploitation, content made available would be considered available in the entirety of the EU – this
body would therefore be responsible for direct distribution for royalties/levies/other means of
remuneration to right-holders. The creation of a centralised system by way of a European agency is
supported by a submission by the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition
Law62, which argued that contrary to the view expressed by the Commission that this method would be
more anti-competitive than other proposed solutions 63 , a centralised system leads to increased
efficiency in the market for copyright licensing, as collective rights management constitutes a form of

natural monopoly64, a view supported by many other academics that study CRMOs65. Furthermore, by
trying to increase competition in this area, the Commission appears to have had the effect of increasing
fragmentation of repertoires66. By creating a European licensing agency, ‘one-stop’ licensing and
remuneration may be achieved, bringing down territorial restrictions and facilitating a unified
approach to exceptions and limitations to copyright.

  75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
      of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES

As stated by Reinbothe, it is readily apparent that the Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) is the result
of a compromise67. Kierkegaard68 and Huniar69 consider that this is largely due to the hasty drafting
and implementation of the Directive in order to ensure its adoption prior to the 2004 Accession. In
particular, critics have identified ambiguities in the language of the Directive. Does the Directive
apply only to infringements made on a commercial scale, or infringements more generally? Reinbothe
argues that the Directive is applicable in all situations involving infringement70, which appears to be
inconsistent with Commission insistence that it was applicable to commercial scale infringements
only71. Furthermore, ‘commercial scale’ and ‘commercial purpose’ have not been defined. It is
submitted that any action in this field should be subject to the provision of strictly delimited working
definitions for these concepts.


  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
      establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as
      well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES


     79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
         level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term
         project?

rightholder.’
At this point in time, due to the uncertainties discussed in preceding sessions, the complexities and
difficulties caused by the existence of copyright as a partially harmonised yet territorially applicable
rights, and the need for reform copyright laws in relation to the limitations and exceptions, term of
protection and enforcement mechanisms, it would appear to be time for a more ambitious approach to
be taken. For this reason, a unitary copyright title should be the next step in EU copyright
development. While this may be an arduous process, it would make more sense to address this
directly, rather than making minor or moderate reforms to the exiting system that may be ineffective as
they do not address issues such as territoriality, necessitating the consideration of an EU copyright
code in the future.

   80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
       Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

One area that appears to have been neglected somewhat in EU copyright law making is the issue of
moral rights. It may be that the development of an EU copyright title/code could also consider
harmonisation of the approach to moral rights in the EU – indeed, if in the interests of reducing or
removing barriers to trade in copyrighted works the establishment of a common copyright code is
deemed to be necessary, this unification of laws would not be complete without consideration of moral
rights. The unification of the economic rights in copyright without the unification of moral rights will
result in only a partial harmonisation that may result in continued difficulties in the cross-border
exploitation and protection of copyrighted works.
