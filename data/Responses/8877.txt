    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

1
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.


Newspaper publishers generally manage their rights (digital and analogue) on an individual
basis whenever feasible or possible. Sometimes it is decided that an RRO could better manage
these rights collectively. The Flemish newspaper publishers mandated the RRO
License2Publish to manage their rights.
The activities of Flemish newspapers, whether in print or digital, operate primarily at national,
regional and local level because this is largely where their market, including advertising and
readers, is located. Cross-border licensing is marginal compared to the national market.
Requests for such licences for secondary uses of already published text works only occur only
occasionally in Flanders. Nevertheless where such requests are made, License2Publish is
licensing the content across borders, no particular problems have been reported regarding
such multi-territory licensing.
It is important to underline that right holders should always be able to decide on the territory
or territories which are the subject of a license. A EU-wide license should always be a choice
and never imposed. Furthermore, cultural issues are an area of national competences, where
subsidiarity should apply.
Nevertheless, to respond to any demand coming from external companies, Flemish publishers
have established database services like Mediagus and jointly with the French and German
speaking newspaper publishers in Belgium the news platform Gopress which provide licenses
for the various uses of digital works or which offer tailor-made services to different types of
users on a commercial basis. The needs of international users (such as the EU institutions for
instance) are also taken into account.
Multi-territorial licensing is the main objective of a project called PDLN (Press Database and
Licensing Network), established by publishers’ rights management organisations and press
database companies). The RRO License2Publish of the Flemish newspapers is a member of
PDLN.

4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
The Flemish newspaper publishers have not identified any problems.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?


  NO – Please explain
As mentioned above the Flemish newspaper publishers have established services which
provide licenses for the various uses of digital works, or which offer tailor-made services to
different types of users on a commercial basis in cross-border situations.
Regarding multi-territorial licensing, the predominantly national nature of the press sector
should be duly taken into account. The management of rights is best dealt with at a national
level due to its very strong effect on local languages and cultures. Any EU-wide initiative in
this area should avoid a “one size fits all” solution that does not take full account of cultural
differences, an enormous diversity of products and sectors (music, news media, books and the
audiovisual), as well as the difficulty to establishing common rules in this area.
In the news media sector, current legislation does not serve as an impediment to the
development of multi-territorial solutions, which the European Commission itself has
confirmed previously in its Reflection Document on “Creative Content in a European Digital
Single Market: Challenges for the Future”, 22 October 2009: “The present legal framework
does not in itself prevent right holders from commercialising their works on a multi-territory
basis” (Art 2, page 12). On the contrary, newspaper publishers are licensing their content to
commercial users in order to make their content available across borders. Commercial users
can generally license a work directly from the publisher or a collecting society or press
database to use it on a worldwide basis.




                                                                                               4
B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

of computer programs.

databases.
11
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined

                                                                                                                 5
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
YES
The Flemish newspaper publishers are of the opinion that the re-use must continue to be
subject to national rules in the territory where the communication is received and “re-used” as
regards the relevant copyright-restricted acts.


9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief15)?
NO
According to the Flemish newspaper publishers the country of origin principle would be
completely against Art. 5 of the Berne Convention: Lex loci protectionis ("[the] law of the
place where the protection is [claimed]"). This important principle together with today’s case
law protects copyright adequately. The country of origin principle would be the end of all
copyright protection in Europe.


2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
     NO

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU16 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of

Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

    Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

                                                                                                    6
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU17 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES
The Flemish newspaper publishers would like to reiterate that yes, under certain
circumstances, it is protected. When links to newspaper content are posted with information,
there is a real risk of diverting readers from the need to read further any relevant information
on the newspaper websites as such. This diversion of traffic also negatively impacts on
advertising revenues which are related to the number of clicks received on the newspaper
website. Publishers’ content should therefore not be used without consent beyond what is
absolutely necessary for navigational purposes in horizontal search.
Specifically, where a hyperlink is comprised of or includes text protected as the whole or part
of a copyright work (see judgement Copiepresse- Google 13.02.2007 and The Newspaper
Licensing Agency Ltd & Ors v Meltwater Holding BV & Ors [2011] EWCA Civ 890), the
‘provision’ of a hyperlink would involve the reproduction of the whole or part of a copyright
work. In such circumstances, the authorisation of the right holder would be appropriate. This
is especially relevant to the provision of paid-for services to business users, which would
otherwise substitute for services which currently generate important income streams for
content owners.
A link to copyright protected content on a copyright infringing site is and has to be subject to
the authorisation of the right holder. Nevertheless, from a newspaper publishers’ point of
view, the EU copyright framework gives the above mentioned necessary protection.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES
When search engines, news aggregators and other third parties link to editorial content on the
Internet, there is an increased risk that readers may not be motivated to click further on to
access the newspaper website, if they already received relevant information in the extracts
provided alongside the link. From a journalistic point of view, the first lines of news article

are very important because they are written to catch the attention of the readers and provide
the essence of a story which is developed in further details below these first lines.


Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC clearly gives the response to this
question. Temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or
incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole
purpose is to enable:
(a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or
(b) a lawful use
of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent economic
significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2.
Everything which goes beyond this exception (and is not covered by any other exception of
paragraph 2) is protected under copyright.
It is also apparent from the recitals to Directive 2001/29/EC (e.g., recitals 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12)
that rightholders are intended to be afforded a high level of protection in respect of their
copyrighted works. Furthermore, the Directive (e.g. recitals 15 and 22) makes it clear that
copyright plays an important role in the fight against piracy.
In addition, Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29/EC makes it clear that the exception in Article
5(1) (which provides a limited exception for certain temporary copies) is not intended to
operate in a manner which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the work and/or
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder.


Non-commercial and commercial use
In most cases, a website owner will want people to visit their website to read/view the
material on it. Therefore in many if not most cases, the rights-holder will have granted an
express or implied licence to the user to make any screen/cache copies of a web page.
However, it does not follow from this that the rightholder should therefore simply be divested
of the fundamental choice either to prevent such copies being made, or to impose a licence fee
for making them. In a minority of cases, the rightholder may wish to restrict use of its
website content. Sometimes the rightholder will erect a paywall to restrict access to its
content to achieve this. A paywall , however, applies the same restriction on access to all
users.
A newspaper publisher might, for example, wish to allow members of the public to freely
view its website for non-commercial use while precluding, or charging a licence fee for, any
commercial use. Copyright provides the legal basis for the publisher to preclude that use or
make that charge. If a newspaper has to opt for a paywall in order to monetise commercial
use of its content by the minority, it will mean that the majority of people who read/view its
website for non-commercial purposes will no longer have free online access to that content.
If, however, there is no paywall but the publisher is unable to rely on copyright to charge a
licence fee for such commercial use, the publisher is deprived of revenue that they would
have otherwise been entitled to (and which they do receive in relation to the same commercial
use in the offline world, where the user would have to pay for the printed copy). This would
therefore conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and/or unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interests of the rightholder.

                                                                                                8
Piracy
Furthermore, if temporary copies made on the screen/ in the cache memory of the user’s
computer (such as streamed copies or copies accessed via cloud services) are not subject to
authorisation, those users could view pirated/otherwise unauthorised copies of copyright
works with impunity. This would certainly do very little to stem the growing tide of piracy in
the EU faced by all rightholders if users can utilise the services of pirates knowing that they
are not infringing copyright. In fact, it is more likely to add to the problem, particularly with
the growth in streaming and cloud services referred to above.
Rightholders will be left to pursue the operators of illegal websites (who are often located
beyond the EU and so are difficult and expensive to pursue) and/or internet service providers
(where obtaining ‘blocking injunctions’ can be time and cost-intensive with no guarantee of
the resulting injunction – if granted – not being easily circumvented by technological means).


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)18. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)19. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
14.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.




18
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
19
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                                9
From the point of view of the Flemish newspaper publishers, a legal framework enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content would pose a severe threat to any existing and
future business models of press publishers.
If, for example, a weekly newspaper which has been purchased would be resold within the
same week on a digital resale platform, readers would not buy the newspaper from the
original publisher. To apply the same principle of exhaustion of the right to control the resale
in Recital 28 to digital products would simply destroy paid for business models.
Such a resale right would certainly undermine the primary market, e.g., by negatively
impacting prices and reducing incentives to invest in newspaper content. The outcome would
ultimately negatively impact media pluralism.
Ultimately it should be up to a rightholder to decide on how their content can be used by
others.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute20. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered21.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     NO
 The view of the Flemish newspaper publishers is that a registration system at EU level would
create an unnecessary administrative burden and result in an overall weakening copyright
protection, due to the inevitable assumption that only registered works would benefit from
copyright protection.
Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
Furthermore such a system would be against Article 5 paragraph 2 which clearly states that
the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality.


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
X


17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

20
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             10
Please refer to the answer under point 15.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed22, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database23 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition24 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub25 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
Today, technology is being further developed to facilitate click-through licensing solutions in
the press sector. In particular, a cross-media, multinational coalition of more than 40 partners
– including press publishers - from the media and creative industries, including
representatives of authors and artists, was launched in 2011 to work together with their
standards bodies to establish automated and semi-automated communications, based on
identifiers and interoperable metadata standards, between rightholders and those who wish to
use content. Our European association ENPA is a partner organisation of the Linked Content
Coalition (LCC).
A pilot project, the RDI, supported by the European Commission is now underway to further
develop the project. Any Web user creating new content, whether it involves re-use of
existing content or not, should be able simply to add such identifiers to enable them to better
protect and potentially monetise their content.
Newspaper publishers support a continued dialogue with the European Commission in order
to inform and update it as regards exploring possible pan-European dimensions to national
initiatives such as the UK’s Copyright Hub. Where feasible, the EC can support the work of
initiatives, which aim to develop further internet-based solutions for the provision of legal
access to and use of text and image based works.
22
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                              11
Nevertheless, legislative intervention of the EU is not necessary from the point of view of
press publishers in order to promote or make such systems obligatory, we would advise it to
be left the market to continue developing the necessary tools.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention26 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES
The Flemish newspaper publishers regard the current terms of copyright protection as
appropriate in the digital environment. Publishers should have the benefits of the protection of
their intellectual property rights, also in recognition of the historical and cultural importance
of news reporting of current and past events and the vital role that newspapers play in a
democratic society.
Maintaining an appropriate duration of copyright protection is particularly important for
newspaper publishers, given the commercial value of their archives which are increasingly
part of subscription and other paid-for business models.
Newspaper publishers digitise and make available their content not only through their print
and digital editions, but also through their archives and databases on a commercial basis.
While we have much in common with the other publishing sectors, newspaper publishers
differ in our business models, with our archives having a significant commercial value. New
markets are developing all the time, for both historic and contemporary collections.



     II.     Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC27.


26
  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
27
  Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

                                                                                                             12
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law28. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)29, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional30, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")31.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
28
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
29
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
30
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
31
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            13
NO
The current optional nature allows Member States the possibility to exercise their national
competence regarding creative and media content which, by its nature, is predominantly of
local, regional and national character. There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory
exceptions and limitations would lead to a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen by
the EU, based on optional exceptions and limitations, combined with the development of
practical solutions on a case-by-case basis to enhance harmonisation, when required and
appropriate.
This pragmatic, voluntary approach has also allowed Europe to take the lead in the
development of innovative solutions and enabled that European “IPR-intensive industries
account for more than 56 million jobs, or 26% of total employment, in the EU.”
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/intellectual-property/docs/joint-report-epo-ohim-final-
version_en.pdf, page 59.)


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO
The current EU legislative framework provides an appropriate balance between rightholders
and users in terms of rights and exceptions to copyright. Changing this equilibrium would
jeopardise the investment of publishers in editorial content, undermine their commercial
activities and hold back the development of new business models.
The European Union model has been shaped by the various legal, cultural and historical
traditions of its Member States, which vary substantially and encompass civil law and
common law countries. This diversity of traditions poses challenges to the European Union,
but it also represents its strength. The Flemish newspapers do not regard harmonisation of
exceptions and limitations to be either necessary or beneficial in the EU context of 28
Member States with different cultural backgrounds.
In the view of publishers, the mix of elements in the EU copyright framework, is carefully
chosen to address national requirements and traditions. Flexibility can only be built on general
principles, leaving some degree of discretion to the Member States.
Exceptions and limitations in national legislation are subject to compliance with the three-step
test of the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD Article 5.5, and adapted to the special needs
and legal and other traditions of the individual Member State. In the EU, this general principle
is combined with a mandatory and several optional exceptions and limitations. We do not see
how more detailed norms on a Community level could serve the purpose of improved
access to copyright works or enhanced competitiveness in a changing technological and
media environment.



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO
Any further limitation or exceptions would cause a serious risk to publishers existing business
models and to the development of new digital business models. This would ultimately lead to

                                                                                             14
a threat to publishers’ ability to continue fulfilling their democratic mission in society and
also place media diversity at risk. Furthermore, any reform of the EU copyright framework
should certainly not include the introduction into European copyright law of an American-
style general fair use provision.
The Flemish newspaper publishers are strongly opposed to the introduction of a “fair use”
provision into EU copyright framework. Such a provision is open to misuse in a way which
ultimately undermines the investments of right holders. In our view, a “fair use” provision is
wholly unnecessary in the context of the EU copyright framework which already provides for
a comprehensive list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.
Furthermore, the widely differing interpretation of what “fair use” actually means inevitably
creates legal uncertainty. The United States experience shows that such a provision favours
those who have the resources to litigate. The actual scope and meaning of “fair use” in the
U.S. is therefore still being defined by case law.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


Newspaper publishers would like to stress that the optionality of exceptions and limitations in
the EUCD already provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. EU legislation already allows
for a comprehensive list of exceptions to copyright.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
 NO
In general, in respect of licensing of newspaper content, the territoriality of limitations and
exceptions does not constitute particular problems. User requests related to rights are to a
large extent confined to uses and users within the territory of one member state. Demands for
cross-border or multi-territory licensing are limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on the
basis of the current models of operation.
As set out in previous questions, the flexibility provided by the Directive, which allows for
the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, is important in order for the copyright
framework to meet the needs of individual member states, taking into account Europe’s
cultural diversity.



27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

                                                                                             15
The question could be addressed via reciprocal agreements as is the case of legal licenses.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving32 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions33. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive34.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
NO
Respect for copyright and fair competition are essential preconditions for publishers’
continued investment in the wide range of quality content to inform European citizens.
Archiving newspapers should only be done with an aim to preserve European cultural
heritage.
     29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




32
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
33
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
The Flemish newspaper publishers do not think a legislative solution is needed.

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
X

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rightholders that enable you to provide
remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes
of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?


Yes, the Flemish newspaper publishers have licence agreements with libraries and archives to
give off-premises access to their archives and content to students for research and education
purposes. These agreements are made in respect of the copyright protection of the content
provided by newspapers. It is of outmost importance that the existing exception in article 5 (3)
(n) remains for use within the premises of the libraries and archives and that any off premises
use needs an agreement with the right holders. Those agreements, which also include special
technical measures in order to access content, ensure that business models of newspaper
publishers are not harmed by giving free access to their content to students and other
researchers.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The Flemish newspaper publishers are not aware of any problems. However, it is important
that this sort of remote access is agreed in a licensing agreements – and not in legislation - and
does not prejudice right holders’ exploitation of their own content.



                                                                                               17
34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

The Flemish newspaper publishers do not think that a legislative solution is needed.

35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?



3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rightholders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     NO
The Flemish newspaper publishers are not aware of digital newspapers being lent out,
including in cross-border situations.

37.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The Flemish newspaper publishers are not aware of any specific problems at present as
regards newspapers. However, it is particularly important that terms of any e-lending
activities are agreed contractually in advance between libraries etc. and right holders.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

                                                                                             18
Any off-premises consultation of newspapers content via a library poses a severe risk to the
business models of newspapers. People would then not subscribe, buy or consult websites or
apps of newspapers any longer. It is therefore essential that such uses continue to be agreed
individually between publishers and libraries.


4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other35. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)36.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?


NO
The mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies may
represent a risk to publishers’ ability to develop new business models in the digital
environment, and to monetise their content.
The main focus in the 2011 MOU was on books since the newspaper sector functions in an
entirely different way and newspapers digitise and make available “old” content through their
online archives and databases on a commercial basis. It is rather difficult to define out of
commerce works for press.

35
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
36
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             19
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


NO
Mass-digitisation of newspaper content by public libraries or by private companies represents
a considerable risk to publishers’ ability to make contractual agreements with their partners,
in order to monetise their content and therefore ensure that their titles can remain sustainable
in both the print and digital environment.
Providing new mechanisms for mass-digitisation would represent a direct threat to publishers’
economic sustainability and their ability to respond adequately to the digital challenges.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC37 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?


NO
The Flemish newspaper publishers are not aware of any specific problem. However, the
Flemish newspaper publishers understand the exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a narrow
exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it states: to illustrate; which
is far from being the same as planned producing of teaching material. Teaching material in
whatever format, including multiple copying for classroom use, cannot and is not destined to
be made under this exception, as it would definitely undermine the normal exploitation of
these works. Therefore any broadening of the existing exception would seriously undermine
business models of publishers and existing licensing solutions.


43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Regarding illustration and teaching, licensing agreements are the most pragmatic way forward
in addressing problems, rather than e.g., legislation.

37
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               20
Furthermore, newspaper publishers feel that the licensing agreements have a firm societal
advantage regarding the value of content. Licensing demonstrates to consumers that creative
works and content have a value and that using works that are created and owned by others
thus require their authorisation or license. In addition, newspaper publishers remain very
active in media literacy programmes at educational establishments covering all age groups.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

The Flemish newspaper publishers have been pioneers in promoting the use of content for
teaching purposes. The role of newspaper publishers in improving media literacy through
various programmes, particularly in schools, was recognized in the 2009 European
Commission Recommendation on media literacy (2009/625/CE).

Furthermore, publishers’ individual licensing schemes are used extensively by e.g., the
scientific and research communities (also together with collective licensing schemes offered
by RROs), for print as well as online use. One outcome of the Licences for Europe (Working
Group 2) was the development of a “toolkit” setting out examples of tools currently available
by RROs and other CMOs to legally use copyright protected text and image works, including
for education. This toolkit, presented by IFRRO, was supported by the Flemish newspaper
publishers.
The Flemish newspaper publishers have been active for many years at national level in
specially developed “Newspaper in Education” programmes in primary and secondary
schools, i.a. the initiative called “Kranten in de Klas” that delivers newspapers and education
tools to schools;

In the digital era, these projects have shown to be really helpful to media users to develop
understanding of how and why media content is produced and to evaluate the trustworthiness
of different sources. These programmes both help young people approach media content,
distinguish between fact and opinion, and between editorial and advertising, as well as
teaching them how to create their own press content.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

The Flemish newspaper publishers do not think that a legislative solution is needed.

46.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Further government support for media literacy projects involving newspapers in schools
would be welcome.




                                                                                            21
C.        Research
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
     NO
The Flemish newspaper publishers are not aware of any issues. Nevertheless it has to be
underlined that any broadening of the existing exception would create a serious risk to
existing business models and licensing solutions. However, while there are generally no major
problems, for some publishers lack of consistency in provisions on fair compensation for non-
commercial research across the EU has been an issue.



48.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

X
49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?

Publishers provide licensing solutions for access to newspaper content for researchers and
academic institutions for the purposes of scientific research, often free of charge or for a
minimal fee. Publishers continue efforts to make such licensing easier and more efficient.



D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC39 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 40.

The Marrakesh Treaty41 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?


NO
Exceptions in favour of persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled,
exist in Belgium. Also, publishers offer licensing agreements to facilitate access to copyright
published works for those user groups.
The Flemish newspaper publishers are aware of many barriers to access to information
experienced by persons who have partial vision and who have print disabilities. Publishers
support the goal that visually impaired persons/persons with print disabilities have access to
information.
The main challenge is linked to the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. The
WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually
Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled, will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the
cross-border exchange of such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come into
force and be implemented in national legislation.
The Flemish newspaper publishers believe that any initiative in this field should be focused
directly on improving accessibility, fully taking into account the national character of
copyright law in the Member States and ensuring that the accessible format copy is used
exclusively by beneficiary persons. Such an instrument must remain fair in its application to
commercially available newspaper content, with the prior authorisation of the right holder.
The Flemish newspaper publishers are open to discussions and voluntary agreements with
Authorised Entities and other stakeholders at national level in order to find balanced
voluntary partnerships and agreements, which enable the Authorised Entities to fulfill their
mission, while at the same time respecting copyright legislation and not undermining
publishers’ commercial activities with respect to their content.

  Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with
Print Disabilities, Marrakesh, June 17 to 28 2013.

It is of fundamental importance that any agreement reached regarding the digitisation
and/or making available of a work for the print disabled should be on a voluntary basis.
The Flemish newspaper publishers that remuneration should be part of any agreement,
unless the publisher chooses to proceed in another way.


The Flemish newspaper publishers believe that the appropriate solution to provide newspaper
content for the print disabled is not more legislation, but cooperation and licensing on a
voluntary basis for between publishers and Authorised Entities. All Flemish newspapers are
available in audio format via the newsplatform Gopress, based on a cooperation with the
Flemish government.


51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
-

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?

It is clear that considerable resources are required to make works accessible to visually
impaired persons and persons with print disabilities. The Flemish newspaper publishers
believe that public institutions and government have an important role to play in providing
sufficient technical and financial means to Authorised Entities representing persons with print
disabilities, as this is part of the public sector and the public mission of the state.



E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics42 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main

42
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              24
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”43. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?


NO
The Flemish newspaper publishers have not experienced specific problems from the use of
text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, when TDM access is provided
for scientific research purposes via licensing models developed by publishers or the licensing
organisations with whom they work.

There is, however, serious potential for problems resulting from the use of text and data
mining in relation to copyright protected content, in cases there would be an exception for
TDM access to newspapers archives.

In the first place, publishers should retain the right to decide how their content may or may
not be re-used by others. It is vital for the long-term sustainability of the publishing that the
end results of any research do not become a substitute for the published content. This would
inevitably jeopardise continued investment by publishers in authoritative content, which in
turn helps to promote advances in research.

Secondly, especially since many publishing houses are small and medium-sized enterprises,
TDM access has to be a managed process in order to avoid disruption of the different
platforms used by publishers. In this context, it is important that potential miners continue to
engage with publishers to achieve the best outcome for their research, given that the different
platforms used by publishers have different capabilities. It is necessary to avoid any potential

43

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .


                                                                                                     25
disruption or degradation to these platforms, which may happen when unmanaged mining
takes place without publisher support.

Publishers already are licensing TDM access to their archives, for example to linguists for
language research. However, it is important for publishers that this is done on a case by case
basis as publishers have to agree on the specific use of the outcome of the research. Even if
such research is not done for commercial use it can have implications on potential newspaper
business models if e.g. certain material would be made public even though the newspaper
could have exploited this information. Furthermore, newspapers have to be able to carefully
manage how much of their archives they can give to researchers and in what format, in order
to prevent massive abuse or loss of their archives. Therefore any exception could lead to
serious risks for publishers’ businesses.

Thirdly, from the perspective of press publishers, any potential exception for TDM could be
misused by news aggregators and media monitoring companies in order to avoid the necessity
of licensing their activities.


54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
By licences, as set out above, rather than introducing a new exception for TDM.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
X

56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

It is clearly to the mutual benefit of both publishers of content and miners to find licensing
solutions which permit researchers to mine works and allow them to do so as seamlessly and
easily as possible, while securing the publishers’ investments in their publications.

European Commission’s ‘Licences for Europe’ Working Group 4 on text and data mining
explored solutions such as standard licensing models as well as technology platforms to
facilitate TDM access, with the aim of promoting the efficient use of TDM for scientific
research purposes. Several participants presented a range of practical and innovative
solutions, which represent the result of major investment by the publishing industry and the
licensing organisations with whom they work. Some of these initiatives are already
successfully being used by publishers and researchers, while others which are being launched
now or being piloted with a view to being launched in the coming months.

These initiatives include a sample licence clause, presented by STM, which allows
publishers to easily provide a quick answer to requests made by the scientific community to
be able to text and data mine content for which they have a subscription. Other initiatives
include PLS Clear, a digital clearing house initiative from the UK’s Publishers Licensing
Society (PLS) developed with the assistance of a group of leading publishers and researchers,
which connects researchers and publishers to further simplify TDM. Crossref’s Prospect
initiative shows that thanks to technical innovations TDM for research for non-commercial
purposes is possible via a click-through licence, and with simultaneous access to cross-
                                                                                           26
publisher content in one standardized format, as is the Copyright Clearance Centre’s (CCC)
pilot TDM service concerning both subscribed and non-subscribed content for commercial
researchers, set for commercial release in 2014. “PDR” licences have also been successfully
developed for the pharmaceutical industry for commercial uses.

However model licenses for scientific researchers cannot replace individual licenses by
newspaper publishers for their archives. As explained above, newspaper publishers enter into
agreements with researchers but this often has to be done on an individual basis as each
research request has to be approved by the newspaper in order not to have for a detrimental
impact on their business model.

Publishers continue to be open to discussing and finding licensing solutions together with the
research community, to facilitate text and data mining with the potential to further research.
As outlined in presentations to Working Group 4, publishers and researchers are already
benefiting from the solutions that have been developed to date. The Flemish newspaper
publishers welcome these innovative solutions and the continued work in this field and
believe that this non-legislative approach represents the most constructive way forward for
both the researchers and publishers concerned.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?



F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs44. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
44
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           27
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions45.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     NO
In response to and in some cases in anticipation of their readers’ needs, the Flemish
newspaper publishers are heavily investing time and resources in digital innovation so that
consumers are today able to read and interact with their trusted, professional content at any
time of the day in a range of different formats and via various devices. As a result the press is
now available on all platforms and is more interactive than ever before.
The Flemish newspaper publishers recognise and welcome that press publishing is a two-way
dialogue in today’s digital environment. UGC in the press-publishing sector concerns on the
one hand what users do with publishers’ content and on the other how publishers then choose
to interact with that content. In summary:
Publishers choose to share professional content with their readers, in order that they may
share it with others, for example by allowing links to articles to be shared via social media.
Readers choose to share content with publishers, in order that they can contribute to
democratic debate, for example, by providing text, photographs and video via publishers’
websites or applications on various devices in relation to news events.
In the digital environment, press publishers want users to engage with professionally
produced content in ways that were not previously possible, recognising the richness and
depth of debate that can arise from this approach. An increasing number of press publishers
actively encourage this dynamic interaction with the users, to the benefit of both parties.
UGC has proven to be truly helpful in providing spontaneous material and feedback from the
public’s perspective in addition to professionally produced journalistic content, which is
trusted by its readers. This is particularly the case for live events and certainly in those rare
and more extreme situations where access of journalists has been restricted.
With greater and more integrated use of UGC in mind, many publishers have redesigned their
digital layouts in order to meet the expectations of the public and increase traffic, for instance
by giving prominence to live blogging or other ways of the public engaging with their
newspaper or magazine. Citizen participation supported by press publishers creates a valuable

45

                                                                                                     28
societal dynamic and the collaboration between UGC and quality professional journalism
represents a new, and fascinating chapter for publishing and journalism.


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use?
NO
Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
YES, proprietary systems are sufficient. Where users want to submit content to publishers for
publication, publishers provide for terms and conditions, which set out the uses the publishers
may undertake with the shared content, should they choose to provide their content.
Publishers are increasingly promoting awareness of such terms and conditions.
It is clear from the above that engaging with UGC in some capacity is now part of the daily
business of publishing for many publishing houses, with this two-way dialogue being
beneficial for both publishers and users. By facilitating easier access to their content for users,
this allows publishers to enjoy much closer contact with their readership.
Specifically, press publishers are keen to facilitate and promote users’ access to content,
participation and interaction by adopting tools to provide comments, upload photos, and share
links in social media and elsewhere. This approach is very much at the heart of the press in
today’s digital environment. For example, press publishers are increasingly choosing to
provide “share” & “recommend” buttons and encourage users to share professional press
content with others, with a variety of new platforms offering easy ways of doing so. They
clear, as required, rights relating to the various contributors to their content in order to enable
such use by users.
This approach to sharing selected content means that publishers can better understand how far
articles are being shared and which are the most popular etc., but importantly does not pose a
risk to their sustainability as unlimited copying and pasting of all their content for sharing
would do.
60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
NO


61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As set out above, newspaper publishers use licensing solutions. We do not perceive UGC as a
problem as such and the need for any legislative action in this field to e.g., introduce an
exception, has not been proven. Please refer to the details set out in the Licences for Europe
pledge no 6 “More active reader involvement in the online press”, which was introduced to
the     Plenary      by      press     publishers:     http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-
dialogue/sites/licences-for-europe-dialogue/files/6-Users-online-press.pdf.


                                                                                                29
It should be noted in light of discussions about what UGC means, that it is important to
distinguish between new original work created by a “non-professional” and existing works
which such a person either “copies”, or reuses, or “adapts” for the purposes of publishing a
new composite work. It is important that the public is properly educated about these
distinctions.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
The Flemish newspaper publishers do not see the need for a legislative initiative regarding
UGC.

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The Flemish newspaper publishers who are contacted by users wishing to use their content
typically provide licences for use of the content. These licenses are often for free as long as it
is not for commercial exploitation.
Furthermore, please consult the publishers’ Declaration on improving the user experience
(http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/sites/licences-for-europe-
dialogue/files/6-Users-online-press.pdf), which sets out that press publishers are committed
to – and continue to be committed to - engaging with readers and improving the user experience,
including via the uptake of User Generated Content (UGC) in their online publications and
services, giving a voice to users as well as enhancing their professional content offering. This is
very much in the interests of both publishers and users alike.
While the Flemish newspaper publishers don’t perceive there to be “problems” per se in the
area of UGC for the newspaper sector, our pledge to Licenses for Europe stakeholder dialogue
was even more user engagement in the online press and news reporting. In this regard, we
declared the importance of the following (see further details in the pledge):
1. Improving the user experience and involvement
2. Improving information about both what users can do with press publishers’ content and
what press publishers can do with users’ content
3. Promoting education about intellectual property rights (IPR)
4. Promoting awareness of the technological possibilities to better identify and protect content
5. Sharing best practices across the sector



 III.          Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying46. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain

46
     Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                30
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4748.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions49 in the digital environment?
     NO – Please explain
In the print environment, in most EU Member States, publishers generally rely on
Reprographic Rights’ Organisations (RROs) to manage their reprographic rights. In the digital
environment, however, in various Member States, publishing companies have developed
different services that offer, license and give access to copyrighted works such as articles,
photographs, etc. through publishers’ websites and databases or archive services. It is
important to underline that for both print and digital works, publishers should be free to
choose between collective and individual rights management. However, whenever direct
licensing is not an option – for example when it becomes burdensome for both users and
rightholders – levies have a specific task when publishers are unable to authenticate
reproduction of works. Levies play an effective role when licensing is burdensome or
impossible, notably in cases of reprography and private copying.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?50
This answer cannot be responded to by a simple yes or no. The European Court of Justice
(CJEU) decided in the VG WORT case (C-457/11-C460/11) that a possible consent by the
copyright holder to the copying of his work or other protected material in the context of the
exceptions or limitations provided for in EUCD Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair
remuneration payable under the exception. This means that remuneration paid to the author or
publisher under a licence does not preclude from receiving the fair compensation for the
exception or limitation. Such copies may therefore be covered by the levies.

                                                                                                           31
66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Where publishers are remunerated for certain uses on the basis of copyright levies, the device
and storage medium remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in connection
with online services (e.g. cloud computing). However we are of the view that the levies
system and its organization has to be decided at national level.


67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?51

NO


68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?




     69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
         persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
         transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
         provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
In respect of text and image (reprography) levies, the question is irrelevant, as underlined by
the Commission’s mediator on levies, Antonio Vitorino52, this question is not relevant as
regards text and image reprography levies, as the Copyright Directive (Article 5.2(a)) covers
both private and professional uses, thereby justifying sales to both private individuals and to
business end users.
Consequently, when it comes to analysing the impact of reprography levies, it is not relevant
to make a distinction between private and professional uses, since both of them are subject to
the payment of a levy. Against this background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between
sales of devices in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are permitted by
law in both the private and business spheres. The – unified – device and storage medium
remuneration can therefore be justified both for sales to private persons and sales to business
end users.

   This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

70.     Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
We refer to our response to question 69, which, in short, states that, under EUCD Article
5.2(a), text and image (reprography) levies also covers professional uses. Question 70
therefore becomes irrelevant in relation to text and image (reprography) levies.

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
NO

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers53 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract54. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
X

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     NO

Publishers of newspaper and news media believe that it is important to emphasise that respect
for the freedom to contract and to negotiate should be the fundamental basis to any approach
to this area. For the Flemish newspaper publishers, a cross-sectoral and pan-European
approach to employment practice in the press sector would represent a real threat to the
freedom to contract.
53
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
54
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           33
Any proposal for a common framework would not be an appropriate way to address contract
law, which has been built on the basis of sector specificities and which has evolved in this
context. Any EU initiatives in this field should therefore avoid a “one size fits all” solution
that would fail to take into account the distinction between publishing, audio-visual content
and music, since the contractual relationships and rights’ mangement are organised differently
in each sector.

Moreover, different concepts and legal situations exist in the EU Member States when it
comes to copyright and employment practices, ownership and transfer of rights, as well as
presumption of rights. Various concepts and approaches are used because each corresponds to
a different underlying legal system.

Publishers enter into negotiations at national or company level with the journalist or the union
of professional journalists to achieve collective agreements regarding press content and the
remuneration of journalistic work. In this context, collective negotiation for the acquisition of
rights by publishers from their employees is closely linked to labour law and employment
contract law. It is, therefore, crucial that social dialogue in the newspaper sector remains at
national level and is not introduced at EU level.

According to Art. 4 Paragraph 2 b) of the TFEU the European Union has shared competence
in the field of social policy but only for the aspects defined in this Treaty. In this way, and in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the role of the EU in this area is limited to
supporting and complementing the activities of Member States.

To sum up, the Flemish newspaper publishers do not see any competence for any EU action in
the field of copyright contract law. Any approach at EU level would contravene the principle
of subsidiarity and would not respect national legislation already in place in the different sub-
categories of contract law and in the different sectors and would not respect the freedom to
contract.

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?

     V.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE55 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text56. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of

55
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
56
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

                                                                                                      34
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose57. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure58. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES
A well-functioning IP protection and enforcement system is vital if Europe is to achieve the
full potential of a single digital market that delivers jobs, growth and delivers quality content
for consumers.
Efficient enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to a well-functioning
intellectual property (IP) system. Well-functioning IPR enforcement mechanisms are the best
means to fight against counterfeiting and piracy, make sure that right holders and the society
as a whole can fully enjoy the benefits of the IP system and protect consumersʼ rights in their
purchasing decisions.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
The content of newspaper websites mainly includes editorial content which falls under the
control and the responsibility of the publisher and the editor-in-chief. This content follows
national press law as well as ethical codes of conduct and self-regulation. However, with the
development of the digital economy and the evolution of Internet, newspaper websites include
interactive content and user generated content where readers and individual visitors can
express their views, add their own content or share information. It is practically and
economically not feasible or reasonable for publishers to systematically control or prevent
outside input posted by users.


In our view, it is therefore important and necessary to maintain the benefit of Article 14 for
publishers in certain cases (e.g. blogs, opinion forums etc.). Once an operator of an opinion
forum is aware of specific unlawful user submissions, he has to remove it immediately but it
has to be assured that the current provision is not interpreted in a way that the operator has to
check the forums constantly for any unlawful articles or even pre-censor every post.
Infringements of intellectual property rights in both the print and digital environment must be
addressed and for that matter, a closer cooperation between all authorities and actors involved,
including intermediaries, is necessary. The implementation of the Enforcement Directive



57
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
58
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           35
should ensure coherence with the relevant provisions of the E-Commerce directive including
liability exemptions.
Press publishers have been concerned with the important question how two essential legal
pillars for technology-neutral press can be safeguarded on the public Internet. The digital
press requires both effective copyright protection, which includes the possibility of practical
enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press products or parts thereof, as well
as effective freedom of the press.
In order to maintain good conditions for freedom of the press on the Internet, a number of
distinctions are necessary for the question of third party responsibility for content, some of
which are implemented in the E-Commerce-Directive and in any event not impeded by it or
by the Enforcement Directive. Newspaper publishers agree that it is fundamental there exist a
distinction between data transport infrastructure, which is independent of content ("mere
conduit", Articles 12, 15 E-Commerce-Directive) and all forms of more or less content-related
data processing such as "hosting"(Article 14 et seq. E-Commerce-Directive).
Newspaper publishers are of the opinion that the judicial authority should be the one, who can
balance different rights and freedoms concerned, including freedom of expression. Control of
press content by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would be considered as censorship and
therefore would pose a threat to digital press freedom.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


YES
It is important to underline the right balance between the fundamental right of freedom of
expression and effective copyright protection online, which includes the possibility of
practical enforcement of rights against illegal reproductions of press content.
A necessary precondition to enforce copyright is an effectively enforceable right of
information to identify the name and address of the infringer and also in case of dynamic IP
addresses. In case of copyright infringements of newspapers content, it is necessary to ensure
that judicial decisions can be adequately enforced and respected.
The Flemish newspaper publishers have not identified any specific problems with regard to
the Enforcement Directive, but with certain aspects of implementation of the current text of
the Directive.
- The right balance between the content control of Internet access providers and the digital
freedom of press should be assured.
- Enforcement measures of the Directive are complicated, costly and timely.
Not enough consideration has been given by the EU legislator to the interaction between data
protection rules and implementation of the Enforcement Directive, which leads to
inconsistencies and, in some cases, total lack of remedies for IP rights at national level. This
should be rectified in order to ensure that right holders are not deprived of effective remedies
whenever their rights are infringed.
- Measures, procedures and remedies shall not be unnecessary complicated or costly, or entail
unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays.


                                                                                             36
(Article 3§1 re. General obligation of the Directive) However, some cases at national level
(ex: Copiepresse v. Google) reveals that procedures might be delayed due to courts having an
overload of cases to address, which therefore has an effect on the enforcement of the rights
infringed and could be to the advantage the infringer.
- The situation regarding damages awarded by the courts could be improved.
Damages awards often are not effectively deterring potential infringers from engaging in
illegal activities, particularly because the damages awarded by courts fail to match the level of
potential profit made by such infringements.

     VI. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


  NO
In respect of the copyright legal framework, the EU should continue to pursue a pragmatic
approach. Rather than emphasising on a single EU Copyright Title, the focus should be on the
adoption of an overall IPR strategy, especially given that the IPR intensive industries
contribute over one third of EU’s GDP and 90% of EU’s export comes from IP intensive
industries.
Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources and unnecessarily
distract focus from the important work on an overall EU IP strategy. Also, it is difficult to see
how it could be established on the basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The
different traditions and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit
from being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst EU Member
States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is difficult to see that an overarching EU
Copyright Title is required.


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
NO
The Flemish newspaper publishers believe that the WIPO Treaty and BERNE Convention,
together with CJEU case law, already provides an important degree of harmonisation in the
copyright field.


                                                                                               37
VII.      Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The Flemish newspaper publishers were one of the first creative sectors to offer its content in
digital formats and today is a sector in rapid transformation that offers a diverse range of
authoritative content to European citizens on a range of both print and digital platforms.
Despite the many challenges facing the industry, some 950.000 Flemish newspapers are sold
or distributed in Belgium every day. With the combined reach of print and digital formats, the
overall audience for our content has never been higher. Moreover, the sector continues to
play a vital role in democratic society and in stimulating debate on the great issues facing
citizens today.


One of the challenges facing newspaper publishers in the digital environment is how to ensure
that technology companies and other third parties do not extract the value of their content,
without remuneration for those who created or invested in that content. Effective IPR
enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to combat both piracy and parasitism,
as well as to ensure that right holders and society at large can fully enjoy the benefits of the IP
system. To combat both piracy and parasitism it is crucial to restore a fair competition
between all media and to grant a related right to the press publishers – by analogy with the
audiovisual sector. A publisher’s right would help the press publishers to act more efficiently
against the reuse of their content without a license.


The Flemish newspaper publishers believe that fair competition and equal search are
indispensable conditions for the proper functioning of the digital ecosystem, to the benefit of
all users and consumers. Today, technology platforms and search engines have an enormous
impact on which press content is visible and accessible to citizens on the Internet. In this
context, it is essential that search engines act in a neutral way to ensure that all press content
can be found without any discrimination.


From the press perspective, we would also like to underline that net neutrality guarantees the
same quality of service and the same possibility to reach digital users for all content,
applications and service providers, regardless of a company’s financial capacity. Proposals
currently under discussion at EU level, which would allow for content discrimination, would
be seriously detrimental to innovation, press diversity and ultimately democracy.
