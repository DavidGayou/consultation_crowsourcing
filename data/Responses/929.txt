I.Introduction

A.Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology andthe Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms,
for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content-for information, education or entertainment
purposes-regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presentschallenges. One of them is for
the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and
use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system
of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains
appropriate and is adapted to the newenvironment. This
consultation focuses on the second of these challenges:
ensuring that theEUcopyright regulatory framework stays fit for
purpose in the digital environment to support creation and
innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market,foster
growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural
diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single
Market"1the Commission set out twoparallel tracks of action: on
the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise theEUcopyright legislative framework23with a view to
a decision in2014on whether to tablelegislativereform
proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for
Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary
and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The
Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have
put forward in this context and will monitor their progress.
Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working
Groups (cross border portability ofservices,user-generated
content, audiovisual andfilmheritage andtext and data mining).
Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a
further step in making the user environment easier in many
different situations. The Commission also takes note of the
fact that two groups-user-generated content and text and data
mining-did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The
discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also
taken into account in the context of the review of
thelegislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on
Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality in
the Internal Market,harmonisation,limitations and exceptions to
copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of theEUcopyright
market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider

context of copyright reform".As highlighted in the
October2013European CouncilConclusions5

EUCO169/13, 24/25October2013.

"Providing digital servicesand content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the
digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its
on-going review of theEUcopyright framework in spring2014.It is
important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)466/3,http://ec.eiiropa.eii/int.ernal_market./copyright/copyright.-infso/index
en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011)427final,http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/consultations/2011/audiovisual
en.htm.

and "Content Online"8

ht.t.p://ec.europa.eu/int.ernal_market/consult.at.ions/2009/cont.ent_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination
of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in
the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders
representing all stages in the value chain, including right
holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions
elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The
"Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed
up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the
online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management
Directive and into the current review process.

I.Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?

D.[The territorial scope ofthe rights involved in digital
transmissions and the segmentation of the market through
licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights-e.g. writers, singers,
musicians-do not enjoy a single protection in theEU.Instead,
theyare protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existingEUDirectives. However, differences remain and the
geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of
theMember State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in
the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a
country-by-country basis under national law9.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the
Internet-e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online
e-book seller-therefore requires, in principle, an
authorisation for each national territory in which the content
is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in
a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European
licence, such that content services can be provided in several
Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been
taken atEUlevel to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the
proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights
Management10should significantly facilitate the delivery
ofmulti­territoriallicences in musical works for online
services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for
Europe"12and market-led developments such as the on-going work
in the Linked Content Coalition13.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even if the "same" service is

htt[")://ec.ei.irop;i.ei.i/intem;il_m;irket/copvriüht/docs/licences-ror-ei.irope/l3lI
I3jen-pledges_en.pdr

available in all MemberStates, consumers cannot access the
service across borders (they can only access their "national"
service, and if they try to access the "same" service in
another Member State they are redirected to the one designated
for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative ornon­legislative,including market-led
solutions) need to be taken atEUlevel in the medium term5

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
sectionVIIof this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

2.[Inparticular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
in theEU?

=YES-Please explain whether such problems, in your experience,
are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business
decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premium content such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
software).

Not related to copyright. I avoided business plan with licensing
my software to other countries because i'd have to register for
VAT, which brings additional bureaucracy.

□NO OPINION

E.Is there a need for more clarityas regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

l. [The definition of the rights involved in digital
transmissions]

TheEUframework for the protection of copyright and relatedrights
in the digital environment is largely established by Directive
2001/29/EC6

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of22May2001on theharmonisationof certain aspects of
copyright and related rightsin the information society.

on theharmonisationof certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEUdirectives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software7

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of23April2009on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases8

Directive 96/9/EC of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council
of11March1996on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders9

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called "neighbouring rights" in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors'
content protected by copyright is referred to as a "work" or
"works", while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as "other subjectmatter".

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other

protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over
the internet or similar digital networks.

The most relevant rights fordigital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies10

The right to "authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part" (see Art.2of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art.5(1)of Directive 2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant atthe start of the transmission-e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available-and at the users' end-e.g. when a user
downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to
the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise
or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks11

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public "on demand" (see Art.3of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

2.The act of "making available"

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries wherethecontent is potentially accessible? in each of
the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The
most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European
Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
"targeting" of a certain Member State's public12

See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco
vsSportradar)and Case C-5/11(Donner)for copyright and related
rights, and Case C-324/09(L'Oréalvs eBay) for trademarks. With
regard to jurisdiction see also joined CasesC-585/08 and
C-144/09 (Pammer and HotelAlpenhof)and pending
CaseC-441/13(PezHejduk);see however, adopting a different
approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDGMediatech).

. According to this approachthe copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service
provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity tothat group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

8.Is the scope of the"making available" right in cross-border
situations— i.e.when content is disseminated across
borders—sufficiently clear?

YES

NO-Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"
approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach13

The objective of implementing a "country of origin" approach is
to localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced atEUlevel with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination ofcertain rules concerning copyright and rights
related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and
cable retransmission).

)

□NO OPINION

9.[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a
clarification of the territorial scope of the"making
available"right have an effect on the recognition of your
rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not,
whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or
not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief14

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

□YES-Please explain how such potential effects could be
addressed

=NO

□NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission indigital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensingof works for online use
notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.[Inparticular if you a service provider or a right
holder:]Does the application of tworights to a single act of
economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?

=YES-Please explain what type of measures would be needed in
order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

I believe everyone should be able to make a copy of anything, as
copying alone doesn't transfer any value. It's
distribution/making available that transfers value.

NO

NO OPINION

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internetas a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU15

Cases C-466/12(Svensson),C-348/13(BestwaterInternational) and
C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of

a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU16

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).
See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docsAJKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article5(1)of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.Should the provisionof a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

□YES-Please explain whether you considerthis to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why

=NO-Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because
it does not amount to an act of communication to thepublic-or to
a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright
exception)

Absolutely not. The person creating the link has no control
whatsoever over the content on the linked web-page. The content
on the linked page might change in time completely. It might
even happen that at the time of link creation there was no
copyright-protected content on the linked page, but it might
have been added there later without knowledge of the link
sharer. Ability to share links without worrying is
fundamentalfor the Internet as a communication medium. Links
are just a virtual equivalent of sharing maps of known
neighbourhood. Sharing a link should have no legal consequences
whatsoever. I consider this to be a case in general, with no
exceptions.

□NO OPINION

12.Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user's computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances,be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

□YES-Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

=NO-Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in
general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because
it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

Again,i'mstrongly against this. User coming to a web-page often
has no idea what content he will be served, he often has no
idea what content is copyright protected and what are the
licensing conditions. Viewing a web-page should have no legal
consequences whatsoever. As with links, ability to view
web-pages without worrying is fundamental for the Internet as a
communication medium. Viewing a web page should have no legal
consequences whatsoever. I consider this to be a case in
general, with no exceptions.

□NO OPINION

5.Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The
principleofEUexhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that
tangible article)17

See also recital28of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution(i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)18

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second­hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder's consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constitutedalex specialisinrelation to the Information Society
Directive (UsedSoft, par.51, 56).

15

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after theyhave
"re-sold" it-this is often referred to as the "forward and
delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
marketfor physical goods).

13.[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you
have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

=YES-Please explain by giving examples

I have a watermarked e-bookthaticannot resell, andiconsider this
a violation of my rights. Ifiknew i'd receive a book with any
form of DRM,iwouldn't have bought it.

NO

NO OPINION

14.[Inparticular if you are a right holder or a service
provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal
framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital
content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

F.Registration of works and other subjectmatter-is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in theEUas the
existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute19

For example, it does not affect "domestic" works-i.e. works
originating in the country imposing the formalities as opposed
to works originating in another country.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered20

On the basis of Article3.6of the Directive 2012/28/EU of
theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of25October2012on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office
forHarmonisationof the Internal Market (OHIM)for the
registration of orphan works.

.

15.Would the creation of a registration system atEUlevel help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

YES

NO

NO OPINION

16.What would be the possible advantages of such asystem?

[Open question]

17.What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Open question]

Authors would have to concern themselves with needless
bureaucracy instead of focusing on creation. The bureaucracy is
probably not a problem for richauthors who can afford to pay
assistants, butithink "smaller" authors would be discriminated
bythis. Also,ican envision problems with registration requests,
e.g. having to verify

somehow that the work-to-be-registeredhas indeed been authored
by the requester,and not just taken from someone who didn't
register it yet, or didn't register it on purpose.

18.What incentives for registration by rightholders could be
envisaged?

[Open question]

I don't see much benefit in having works registered. Vast
majority of works come with a note about who is the
author/copyright holder, and nowadays it's not really a problem
to find author's contact information and get in touch with the
him/her if needed.

G.Howtoimprove the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries,which are based to a greater
or lesser extent ontheuse of (more or less) interoperable,
internationally agreed 'identifiers'. Identifiers can be
compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific
to the sector in which they have been developed21

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously,the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database22

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:htt.p://www.globalrepert.oiredat.abase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition23

You will find more information about this initiative (funded in
part by the European Commission) on the following
website:www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights
ReferenceModel (RRM)-a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub24

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

19.What should be the role of theEUin promoting the adoption
ofidentifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

Idon't thinkEUshould play a role in this area. The need for
interoperability of such databases is motivated by economic
incentives of database owners, so it should be their
responsibility to agree with other database owners on common
standards. I don't think this needs to be addressed by laws or
regulations, it should happen by itself. Software
standardsemerge in a similar way.

H.Term of protection-is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matterare protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention25

Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,ht.tp://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/beme/.

requires a minimum term of protection of50years after the death
of the author. TheEUrules extend this term of protection
to70years after the death of the author (as do many other
countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in theEUrules also
extend20years beyond what is mandated in international
agreements, providing for a term of protection of70years after
the first publication. Performers and producers in the
audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an
extended term of protection.

20.^re the current termsof copyright protection still
appropriate in the digital environment?

□YES-Please explain

NO-Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

I believe current terms of protectionare greatly exaggerated. I
think that the protection term should be about10years since
publicationof the work, allowing the author to earn enough
money and at the same time not hinder social and technological
advancement. Even though i'm an author myself,ithink it's not
reasonable that authors can earn money decades after publishing
their work and prevent others from freely using and remixing
their worksto further contribute to progress of the society. I
see no other profession having such privileges, andibelieve
that related law was pushed into its current exaggerated state
by greedy lobbying of music and movie distribution companies.

NO OPINION

I.Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instancetheuse
for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). AtEUlevel they are established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive
2001/29/EC26

Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases;
Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of computer
programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending
right.

.

Exceptions and limitationsin the national andEUcopyright laws
have to respect international law27

Article9(2)of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works(1971);Article13of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property
Rights)1994;Article16(2)of theWIPOPerformers and

18

Phonograms Treaty(1996);Article9(2)of theWIPOCopyright
Treaty(1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, theEUacquis
requires that limitations and

exceptionscan only be applied in certain special cases which do
not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other
subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included
inEUlaw is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to
the rights harmonised atEUlevel)28

Other than the grandfatheringof the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions are often optional29

With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive,(iii)Article5(1)in the Directive 2001/29/EC
and(iv)the Orphan Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to doso). Finally, it is worth noting that
not all of the limitations and exceptions included in theEUlegal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy
terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning
of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so
an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may
still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move
to the Member State "B")30

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given across­bordereffect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work-for instance a
novel-is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that same
novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States
and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

□YES-Please explain why

□NO-Please explain why

.

The cross-border effect oflimitations and exceptions also raises
the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some
instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders
for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to
their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged,
but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a
limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online coursegiven by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that theEUand
Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in theEUand
Member States regulatory framework while ensuringtherequired
legal certainty, including for the functioning oftheSingle
Market, and respecting theEU'sinternational obligations.

limitations and exceptions provided in theEUcopyright
directives are optional for the Member States?

an option to furtherbroaden the exceptions if they deem
beneficial to do so.

flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the
ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by

[Open question]

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational

establishmentsand museums, as well as archives. If implemented,
these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving31

Article 5(2)c of Directive2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and othersubject
matter in the collections of such institutions32

Article 5(3)n of Directive2001/29.

. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed bytheRental and Lending Directive33

Article5of Directive 2006/115/EC.

33.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you
experienced specificproblems when trying to borrow books or
other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you negotiated

□YES-Please explain with specific examples

□NO

.

Questions arise as to whetherthe current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitationof works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films)-the restoration or replacement of works, the
copying of fragile works-may involve the creation of another
copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member
States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing
for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards
the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
newtypes of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and
archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
of works and other subject- matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments forthepurpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisationand is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32.(a)[In particular if you are an institutional user:]Have you

2.E-lending

Traditionally, public librarieshave loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

3.Mass digitisation

The term "mass digitisation" is normally usedto refer to efforts
by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g.
scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an
objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make
them available to the public. Examples are efforts by libraries
to digitise novels form the early part of the 20thcentury or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter
has been partly addressed at theEUlevel by the2011Memorandum of
Understanding(MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and
making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are
no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is
aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and
learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between
libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and
the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on
the other34

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:htt.p://ec.europa.eu/int.emal_market/copyright./out.-of-commerce/index_en.ht.m.

. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently tobe found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary
licences (granted by Collective

Management Organisations onthe basis of the mandates theyreceive
from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to
enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such
licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of
representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an
"extended effect" to the licences granted)35

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU. The French
act(LOIn°2012-287du1ermars2012relativeà l'exploitation
numérique des livres indisponibles duxxe
siècle)foreseescollective management,unless the author or
publisher in question opposes such management. The German
act(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und
einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom1.Oktober2013)containsalegalpresumption of representation by
a collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are
not members of the collecting society.

I. Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC36

Article 5(3)a of Directive2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching. Suchexceptions would typically allow a
teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of
newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without havingto obtain authorisation
from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for
certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

disabled. The Treaty createsa mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute
and make available accessible format copies to visually
impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders.
TheEUand its Member States have started work to sign and ratify
the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions
atEUlevel (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible

L. Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics41

For the purpose of the present document, the term "text and data
mining" will be used.

are different terms used todescribe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysisis made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protectedworks or other
subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the
right holders for the making of such copies unless such
authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article5.1of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright.None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue
gobeyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

AspecificWorking Groupwassetup on this issue in the framework of
the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was
reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems
to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical
solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe"42

See the document "Licences for Europe-ten pledges to bring more
content
online":http://ec.europa.eu/internalmarket/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113
ten-pledges en.pdf.

. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription
agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and
data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a
distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

M. User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
"user-generated content". While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms andblogs43

A typical example could be the "kitchen" or "wedding" video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are "mash-ups" (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.)
ina blog.

.User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of
pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work
does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from
merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity
is not "new" as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased thepotential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders andtheusers generating the content. In any
event, practical solutions to ease user-generated

contentand facilitate micro-licensing for small users were
pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of
the "Licences for Europe" discussions44

61.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

62.If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what
would be its main elements? Which activities should be covered
and under what conditions?

[Open question]

I think personal non-commercial use for creating UGC should be
treated as fair use. The condition should be that the UGC needs
to be different enough from the original, so that it's not
mistaken for the original work.

63.If your view is that a different solution is needed, what
would it be?

I.Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enablesMember States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying45

Article5.2)(a) and (b) of Directive2001/29.

. Leviesare charges imposed at national level on goods typically
used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment,
photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4
players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online-e.g. when
a person has boughtan MP3 file and goes on to store multiple
copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile
phone)-also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these
levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the
licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to
instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on
top of service providers'licence fees5657.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.In your view, is there a need to clarify at theEUlevel the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography
exceptions46

Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

in the digital environment?

□YES-Please explain

□NO-Please explain

□NO OPINION

65.Should digital copies made byend users for private purposes
in the context of a service that has been licensed by
rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal,
be subject to private copying levies?47

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
AntonioVitorinoresulting from the mediation on private copying
and reprography levies

□YES-Please explain

NO-Please explain

Everyone should be able to backup their data or reproduce it for
private purposes. Once a person obtains a license to use a work,
they shouldn't be any further copying levies. User shouldonly
pay once.

NO OPINION

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application
to online services(e.g. servicesbased on cloud computing
allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders'revenue on the other?

[Open question]

67.Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the
invoices for products subject to levies?48

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
AntonioVitorinoresulting from the mediation on private copying
and reprography levies.

□YES-Please explain

□NO-Please explain

□NO OPINION

Diverging national systemslevy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free
circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy
thesesituations and reduce the number of undue payments49

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
AntonioVitorinoresulting from the mediation on private copying
and reprography levies.

.

68.Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border
transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate
payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

□YES-Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the
percentage of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a
priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes could
help to remedy the situation.

□NO - Please explain

□NO OPINION

69.What percentage of products subjectto a levy is sold to
persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly
unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example
you provide (type of products, type of transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

70.Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do
they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex
post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help
to remedy the situation?

[Openquestion]

71.If you have identified specific problems with the current
functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best
be solved?

[Open question]

I.Fair remuneration of authors and performers

TheEUcopyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in theEUcopyright law governing thetransferof
rights from authors or performers to producers50

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the ownerof the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract51

See e.g. Art.2.3.of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art.4of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiationmechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action atEUlevel
isnecessary.

72.[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the
best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that
you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of
your works and performances?

[Open question]

73.Is there aneed to act at theEUlevel (for instance to prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

□NO-Please explain why

I.Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE52

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of29April2004on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonisedframework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text53

You will find moreinformationon the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/intemal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect forcopyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement
measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright,measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for
copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose54

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volumeof
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure55

This clarification should notaffect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and dataprotection for
private users.

75.Should the civilenforcement system in theEUbe rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

□YES-Please explain

□NO-Please explain

□NO OPINION

76.In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

[Open question]

77.Does the current civil enforcementframework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one's
copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

□YES-Please explain

□NO-Please explain

I.A singleEUCopyright Title

The idea of establishing a unifiedEUCopyright Title has been
present in the copyright debate for quite sometimenow, although
views as to the merits and the feasibility of such anobjective
are divided. A unifiedEUCopyright Title would totally harmonise
the area of copyright law in theEUand replace national laws.
There would then be a singleEUtitle instead of a bundle of
national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a
truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be
ensured, while others believe that the same objective can
better be achieved by establishing a higher level
ofharmonisationwhile allowing for a certain degree of
flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

78.Should theEUpursue the establishment of a singleEUCopyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across theEU,as well as a
single frameworkfor enforcement?

YES

NO

NO OPINION

79.Should this be the next step in the development of copyright
in theEU?Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

I.Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive
consultation on the most important matters relating to the
current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could
bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed
in the future.

80.Are there any other important matters related to theEUlegal
framework for copyright?Please explain and indicate how such
matters should be addressed.

[Open question]

IthinkEUshould facilitate sharing of cultural and technological
heritage, and boost social progress by shortening the
protection terms of works. I think10years should be enough in
majority of cases.

Alsoithink law shouldn't treat unauthorized sharing of works as
stealing. Sharing can be beneficial for the author. Some
musicians give out their works for free because it makes them
more known among people, and then they earn more money in
concerts. I give out my software for free because it makes me
more known in the software developer community and it helps me
get a good job. It makes me sad when someone is sued for
unauthorized sharing, and thesuerclaimsthat the defendant only
did the suer harm and no good. I think treating unauthorized
sharing as a serious crime is not right.
