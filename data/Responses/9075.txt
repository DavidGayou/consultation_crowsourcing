    Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[1]. Moreover a system of registration does  not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[2].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES








  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]
Voluntary registration , keeping within Berne Convention, would offer
benefits to ease licensing and fight cross-border infringement, especially
in the areas where there are at present no well functioning international
databases of works (for example in the field of music such databases
exists). Registration is possible in more than 40 countries, according to a
WIPO survey
http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/copyright/en/registration/pdf/registrat
ion_summary_responses.pdf
and voluntary registration is widely used for example  in US and China
where it is possible.
The EU Copyright Code could be a council regulation and define the European
wide registered right
Techically  a regulation  such as the COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 6/2002 of
12 December 2001 on Community designs amended by Council Regulation No
1891/2006 of 18 December 2006 amending Regulations (EC) No 6/2002 and (EC)
No 40/94 would define the registered right , and registration would be
handled by OHIM. Also it should be possible to choose this EU wide right in
agreements.
National copyright laws would still apply in cases where there is no EU
registration or parties of an agreement have not chosen to define the right
agreed upon as the right defined by Council Regulation on Copyright . This
voluntarily registered right should be drafted in the context of the Berne
Convent.







  17. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


There could be incentives linked to cross-border injunctions in  cases of
copyright infringement of the registered works.



    Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[3]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in   their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


 21. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
     user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
     or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
     across borders?


YES –

The teaching exception in the Finnish Copyright law does not allow the use
of audio visual works in teaching. Thus  for example videos showing
important historical choreography cannot legally be used in university
teaching at University of the Arts Helsinki, some of this material does not
have the permissions from all the rightholders that would be needed to make
licensing possible. Cultural heritage does not survive unless it is passed
on to new generations of students of art. Illustration for teaching  at
university level should be allowed for all categories of works, including
audiovisual works. Open courseware and other courseware created to be used
on line cannot use parts of or full works to illustrate the content of
courses because online courses would be cross-border use and there is no
mandatory, harmonized  exception for teaching materials. Finland does not
have an exception rule that covers all works to  illustrate  teaching at
university level.




 22. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

A solution would be a harmonized mandatory exception for use of all kinds
of works, including audiovisual and visual works to illustrate teaching at
university level institutions. This kind of limited exception would pass
the Berne Three Step test and would take the economic rights of right
holders into consideration.



 23. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
     content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
     they?
 Finland does have an extensive collective licence for text and still
images used in digital teaching materials and this extended collective
licence has been provided for universities by the Ministry  of Education
and Culture and collecting society Kopiosto. For the limited scope that
this licence offers namely text and still-images, this licence works well
and universities are pleased with this solution.
For Finland and for classroom use in Finland this extensive collective
licence works well, but it does not allow for online use or across borders
use.



 24. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
     its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
     should be covered and under what conditions?

A solution would be a harmonized mandatory exeption for use of all kinds of
works, including audiovisual and visual works, to illustrate teaching at
university level institutions. This kind of limited exception would pass
the Berne Three Step test and would take the economic rights of
rightholders into consideration.

of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)[4].


    Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[5]  enables  Member  States  to  choose   whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

 25. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
     user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
     or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
     projects/activities,  including   across   borders?     The   research
     exception in the Finnish copyright  law  does  not  cover  audiovisual
     works. Thus a PhD thesis researching audiovisual commercials could not
     include citations of the audiovisual   research  materials  that  were
     discussed in the scientific text of the researcher.

Research at Art University of Helsinki would also need  the  possibility  to
make copies of works of art  and  of  performances  of  works  of  art,  for
example folk music, for the purposes of research to be used in  the  various
departments of the Art University of Helsinki.

YES –

The Lisbon Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states
that the
European Union calls in particular for the achievement of the European
Research Area to
strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and of its
industry, and
to make them more competitive. The Treaty refers to the ERA as an area of
free
circulation of researchers, scientific knowledge. The full functioning of
this ERA would require the same research exception to apply for all
researchers and institutions in the ERA. EU Commion Horizon 2020 funding
requires  universities receiving funding to publish100% of the funded
research as  open access publications  online  and  a EU wide copyright
exception should facilitate this online use. Now we have research results
that  include works made by  third party  that can be published nationally
or in analogue form based on national exceptions but cannot be published
online or across borders.

 26. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

A good start would be a mandatory research  exception  (including  data  and
text mining) that is neutral with regard to technology and geography


 27. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
     content for research purposes? How successful are they ?

Some of the Member States already offer  wide  technology  neutral  research
exceptions (e.g. Estonia). However,  in  most  of  the  Member  States,  the
exceptions are more limited in substance and geographical scope and  do  not
really offer much help.


In Finland,  extended  collective  licensing  is  available.  The  practical
experiences of the users of these licenses emphasize that this  approach  is
slow and produces only partial solutions


    Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[6]  are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for  Europe”[7].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

 28. (a) [In particular   an  institutional  user:]  Have  you  experienced
     obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining
     methods, including across borders?


x€ YES


The current  Finnish copyright law does  not  have  an  exception  rule  for
datamining, For example literary works aimed to be used as  CLARIN  language
research material could not be  given by Aalto University to be used in  the
 FIN-CLARIN project, because Finland does not have a reseach  exeption  rule
that would apply.



In Finland,  extended  collective  licensing  is  available.  The  practical
experiences have demonstrated that this  approach  slow  and  produces  only
partial solutions


In the U.S., the fair use exception makes it  possible  for  researchers  to
engage in text and  data  mining,   European  institutions  are  thus  at  a
disadvantage.


 29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

 .
A mandatory EU wide   exception  in  copyright  legislation   to  allow  the
extraction of facts and data for the purpose of  text  and  data  mining  is
needed.
If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be  its
main  elements?  Which  activities  should  be  covered   and   under   what
conditions? A specific exception to allow the extraction of facts  and  data
for the purpose of text and data mining  is  needed.  This  exception  would
facilitate the deployment of  new  research  methods  to  exploit  lawfully-
accessed digital content. Any  exception  should  not  discriminate  between
commercial and non-commercial purposes.  Furthermore,  distribution  of  the
results of text and data mining must be permissible so long as  the  results
are not a substitution for  the  original  work.  The  implications  of  the
Database Directive for text and data mining  should  also  be  reviewed  and
down-sized to accommodate this activity


   I. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

 30. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
     as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
     exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
     for enforcement?

x€ YES




 31. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
     EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
     legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

This could be a longer term project, and harmonization should be started on
harmonizing the research exception across the EU. Copyright scholars from
European universities have drafted the European Copyright Code

http://copyrightcode.eu/  which has a solution for a European wide research
and teaching exception.

Techically, EU  Copyright Title  could be a regulation like the successful
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs
amended by Council Regulation No 1891/2006 of 18 December 2006 amending
Regulations (EC) No 6/2002 and (EC) No 40/94 . Similarly to design
legislation, the national copyright  laws could co-exist, making it
possible for rightholders to choose nationally defined rights or rights
defined at EU level.





  II. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

 32. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
     framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
     should be addressed.

Work threshold for copyright protected works in  the  field  of  design  and
architecture is not defined as a European wide work threshold,  which  makes
it possible for infringing companies to copy  for  example   Finnish  design
classics that enjoy copyright protection in Finland.  This  is  demonstrated
by Designers Revolt http://www.designersrevolt.com/en/index.php


Article 17 of Directive 98/71 on the legal protection of  designs,  entitled
‘Relationship to copyright’, provides that a design protected  by  a  design
right registered in or in respect of a Member State in accordance with  this
Directive shall also be eligible for protection under the law  of  copyright
of that State as from the date on which the design was created or  fixed  in
any form. The extent to which,  and  the  conditions  under  which,  such  a
protection is conferred, including the level of originality required,  shall
be determined by each Member State.”


Directive 98/71/EC of the European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  13
October 1998 on the legal protection of designs would have to be changed  on
this point to allow the Court of European Union to determine work  threshold
for the whole of the EU  and  for  all  types  of  works,  including  design
classics in the field of design and architecture.
