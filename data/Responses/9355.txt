The Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and
New Media (BITKOM) represents more than 1,700 companies in Germany. Its
1,200 direct members generate an annual sales volume of 135 billion Euros
annually and employ 700,000 people. They include providers of software and IT
services, telecommunications and Internet services, manufacturers of hardware          Federal Association
and consumer electronics, and digital media businesses. BITKOM campaigns in            for Information Technology,
particular for a modernization of the education system, for an innovative eco-         Telecommunications and
nomic policy and a future-oriented Internet policy.                                    New Media

BITKOM members play an essential role in the media business and in the dis-            Albrechtstr. 10 A

Therefore the European Commission’s “public consultation on the review of the
EU copyright rules” is of high importance for BITKOM and we welcome the                Contact
opportunity to express our views on the questionnaire. The necessity of a copy-        Judith Steinbrecher, LL.M.

end in legal uncertainty and in thwarting innovations and new business models.         j.steinbrecher@bitkom.org

Before answering the questionnaire in detail we would like to highlight some key       President
issues for the European Commission for the upcoming legislative period:                Prof. Dieter Kempf

 We highly appreciate any initiative by the European Commission to simplify           Management
  the licensing procedure. The CRM Directive is supportable but only a first           Dr. Bernhard Rohleder
  step in the right direction.

 The “making available” right and the “reproduction” right have to be recon-
  ceived in terms of online distribution. And it has to be ruled, that linking and
  browsing are no relevant uses in terms of copyright.

 We appreciate any initiative by the European Commission to implement a
  registration system.

 Regarding the principle of exhaustion we urge the European Commission to
  devote attention to the impact on commerce, competition and consumer wel-
  fare caused by the current uncertainty and to be responsive to the need of
  easy and clear understandable rules.
 For “user generated content” a legislative solution is urgently needed.

 We also think that it is important and urgent to discuss the functioning of
  private copying levy systems in Europe. This consultation can be the first
  necessary step to the final discovery that levy systems from the analogue
  world which are based on devices do not fit into the digital age and have to
  be phased out and replaced by alternative systems.

 Last but not least Copyright infringement has to be controlled. The Directive
  2000/31/EC on E-commerce gives relevant and sufficient measures to act
  against copyright infringement and to take adequately account the risk and
  the damage caused by copyright infringement.

 I. Rights and
   the function-

 A. Why is it       1. [In particular if you are

 online content     when trying to access
 services from      online services in an EU
 anywhere in        Member State other than
 Europe?            the one in which you live?

                    2. [In particular if you are a   answer: YES
                    service provider:] Have          The clearing of rights becomes more and more diffi-
                    you faced problems when          cult. Here we see an important need for action.

                                                     If right holders of music continue to exercise their dis-
                    services across borders in
                                                     cretion in the matter of multi-territorial licensing, this
                    the EU?
                                                     will – as has previously been the case and contrary to
                                                     what the Commission clearly hopes will happen – lead
                                                     to a situation in which a few individual right holders will
                                                     continue to cherry pick and remove “lucrative reper-
                                                     toire” from collecting societies and grant multi-territorial
                                                     licences separately. The remaining repertoire will con-
                                                     tinue to be acquired by the national collecting socie-
                                                     ties. This does not involve a simplification of pan-
                                                     European licensing but, entirely counter to the de-
                                                     clared aim, reinforces the status quo which the Com-
                                                     mission itself has found to be inadequate, and may
                                                     even lead to increased fragmentation of the music
                                                     repertoire. The newly introduced right holder’s ”right to
                                                     choose” their collecting society in Art. 5 (2) of the last
                                                     draft of the CRM directive is also expected to further
                                                     complicate clearing processes.
                                                     It is also our view that the current licensing practice
                                                     puts national providers at a clear competitive disad-
                                                     vantage. If a provider wants to introduce a new service
                                                     only to the German market, whether as a niche offer-
                                                     ing or as a start-up, initially in one country or for other
                                                     strategic reasons, the provider previously needed to
                                                     conclude just one copyright licensing agreement with
                                                     GEMA. Today it has to conclude around seven to ten
                                                     agreements in order to be able to provide the global
                                                     repertoire in Germany, including several agreements in
                                                     foreign languages and based on foreign legislation. A
                                                     provider purely active in Germany does not have the
                                                     resources required for this time-consuming and cost-
                                                     intensive process. This is again aggravated by the fact
                                                     that such provider has a smaller turnover and profit,

                                                     because of its national focus.
                                                     Therefore, provider and broadcasters should have the
                                                     option to choose between a pan-European or multi-
                                                     territorial license and national/bilateral licensing.
                                                     Fragmentation of copyrights as an obstacle for smooth
                                                     pan-European licensing is also increased by the prac-
                                                     tice of some important right holders to explicitly prohibit
                                                     innovative accompanying services when licensing
                                                     works for public communication, even if there is no
                                                     sensible legal ground for a separate right of use and
                                                     no separate commercial exploitation. This practise
                                                     poses a serious threat to innovation.


                    3. [In particular if you are a
                    right holder or a collective
                    management organisa-
                    tion:] How often are you
                    asked to grant multi-
                    territorial licenses? Please
                    indicate, if possible, the
                    number of requests per
                    year and provide examples
                    indicating the Member
                    State, the sector and the
                    type of content concerned.

                    4. If you have identified        The acquisition of licenses should be simplified. Pro-
                    problems in the answers to       viders need legal certainty in order to satisfy consumer
                    any of the questions above       demand for innovative services.
                    – what would be the best         To achieve legal certainty, providers of online music
                    way to tackle them?              services need to conclude one agreement for the en-
                                                     tire global repertoire. This should be legislatively guar-
                                                     anteed on EU level. It is generally impracticable to
                                                     exclude individual licensors from agreements because
                                                     pieces of music are delivered by the owners of ancil-
                                                     lary copyright and the lack of sufficient information and
                                                     the complex situation with regard to rights means that
                                                     copyright owners cannot be traced beyond reasonable
                                                     doubt or definitively. Also once the CRM-directive will
                                                     have been adopted the EU legislation does still not
                                                     provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the reper-
                                                     toire of all societies have access to multi-territorial
                                                     licensing. In terms of the current proposal of the CRM-
                                                     directive there is no reference to any pressure to the
                                                     collecting societies to outsource the rights manage-
                                                     ment if they themselves do not wish to grant multi-
                                                     territorial licences. We therefore propose to oblige
                                                     collecting societies to contract with each other in order
                                                     to ensure the necessary accessibility of rights and also
                                                     to contract with right users who seek clearance. As

                                                     processes, the legal rules for their activities should –

                                                     Additionally and to the fostering of local start-ups,
                                                     creative niche providers and comparable companies,
                                                     steps should be taken to ensure that a national blanket
                                                     licence policy applies alongside the pan-European
                                                     licensing structure where services are local and do not
                                                     exceed a defined size. This should also be in the inter-
                                                     est of publishers and collecting societies as they would
                                                     not have the onerous tasks anymore associated with
                                                     very small licensees from other countries in Europe
                                                     and they would promote a broader service structure.

                    5. [In particular if you are a

                    why, even in cases where
                    you hold all the necessary
                    rights for all the territories
                    in question, you would still
                    find it necessary or justi-
                    fied to impose territorial

 B. Is there a
 need for more
 clarity as re-
 gards the scope
 of what needs to
 be authorized
 (or not) in digital
 transmissions?

 1. The act of         8. Is the scope of the            answer: NO
 “making               “making available” right in       Directive 2001/29/EC neither specifies what act is
 available”            cross-border situations –         covered by the making available right (e.g. upload,
                       i.e. when content is dis-         accessibility of actual reception) nor does the directive
                       seminated across borders          define where the act of making available takes place in
                       – sufficiently clear?             cross border situations. If market player do not know
                                                         what is covered by the right of “making available”, EU
                                                         wide licensing is obstructed. Thus there is a need for
                                                         clarification of the scope of the “making available”
                                                         right, in particular in regard to cross boarder situations.
                                                         Firstly, we held that the simple act of uploading to the
                                                         internet is no act of exploitation and should not be
                                                         covered by the “making available” right if no one ever
                                                         accesses it. Moreover, the right of “making available”
                                                         requires that the work is being made available to the
                                                         “public”. Making a work available only to a closed circle
                                                         of persons should not be covered by the “making
                                                         available” right.
                                                         Secondly, we agree that the pure fact a work is acces-
                                                         sible in a certain territory should lead to a license re-
                                                         quirement in this country.

                       9. [In particular if you are a
                       right holder:] Could
                       a clarification of the territo-
                       rial scope of the “making
                       available” right have an
                       effect on the recognition of
                       your rights (e.g. whether
                       you are considered to be
                       an author or not, whether

                    right, either in general or   success story of a free and emancipatory web. If link-
                    under specific circum-        ing would require the permission and/or a license from
                    stances, be subject to the    the right holder this would amount to a significant ex-
                    authorisation of the right    pansion of copyright, with severe and unforeseeable
                    holder?                       social and economic consequences, and serious un-
                                                  dermining freedom of expression.
                                                  Linking does not constitute a “use” of a work subject to
                                                  copyright. A link primarily serves the purpose of a
                                                  reference, index or footnote. A work subject to copy-
                                                  right that has been previously made available to the
                                                  public is neither “transmitted” nor “retransmitted” by
                                                  merely linking to it nor is it communicated to a “new
                                                  public”. A link only facilitates access to a work that is
                                                  already publicly available. This is true regardless of the
                                                  specific form of linking (e.g. surface linking, deep link-
                                                  ing, inline linking/embedding).
                                                  Thus linking should not – neither in general nor under
                                                  specific circumstances – be subject to the authorisa-
                                                  tion of a right holder.
                                                  Currently there are three cases pending at the Euro-
                                                  pean Court of Justice on linking (C466/12, C279/13

                                                  that (deep) linking does not constitute a “use” in the

                                                  over the (future) availability of the linked content. Thus,
                                                  from a copyright perspective, inlinelinking/embedding
                                                  does not interfere with any exclusive right. It has to be
                                                  pointed out that an exclusive right in regard to in-
                                                  linelinking/embedding would lead to severe negative
                                                  consequences for internet and it’s social benefits. Last
                                                  but not least it has to be noted that it would be diamet-
                                                  rical to the interest of the right holders to make in-
                                                  linelinking/embedding subject to an exclusive copy-
                                                  right. Due to prohibitive transaction cost inlinelinking
                                                  would simply vanish. The right holder would not be
                                                  able to increase their revenues. From an economic
                                                  perspective two technical aspects have to be taken
                                                  into account: (i) the link provider has no control over
                                                  the availability of the linked content (what price would
                                                  he be willing to pay?) and (ii) the person who initially
                                                  makes content publicly available on the internet has
                                                  technical control in regard to whether or not the con-

                                                  The Directive 2001/29/EC exempts such temporary

                                                  Art. 5 I would break the internet.

                                                  UK Supreme Court states: “Merely viewing or reading

                                                    anything, are unintentionally likely to incur civil liability.
                                                    As the UK Supreme Court has already rightly noted it
                                                    would be an unacceptable result to consider millions of
                                                    ordinary Internet users to be copyright infringers by
                                                    dint of merely accessing a web-page containing copy-
                                                    right material. This should also not be the intention of
                                                    the European legislator.
                                                    Even though one could argue that browsing legal web-
                                                    sites could be licensed via an implied consent of the
                                                    right holder, whereas browsing illegal websites would
                                                    be not: Internet users cannot judge whether a website
                                                    is legal or illegal before visiting the website. And in
                                                    some cases the Internet user does not even have the
                                                    control about the website opened by the browser.
                                                    Browsing on illegal websites should be banished by
                                                    focusing on the provider of these illegal websites (see
                                                    on question 75ff) and not with criminalizing an action of
                                                    which you cannot even justify a negligence.

                                                 In some cases consumers expect to be able to sell
                                                 what they bought. While in some instances legal un-

                                                 The understanding between the consumer and the

                                                 fore a key consideration. Digital content is sometimes

                                                 EU system provide predictability and encourage trans-
                                                 parency for both distributors/providers and consumers.
                                                 EU copyright law should also ensure that right holders
                                                 are able to exclude the possibility of distributing their
                                                 content to third parties in the license-agreements

                                                 In the software market, for instance, there are busi-

                                                 special conditions, this business model would no long-
                                                 er be viable. This will hurt software consumers, who
                                                 will have fewer choices and pay higher prices. In con-

                                                 their products through a variety of distribution models
                                                 and licensing options allows producers to meet varying

                                                       different right splitting. In many cases more than one

   Single Market

                       21. Are there problems          answer: YES
                       arising from the fact that      The catalogue of limitations and exceptions in the EU
                       most limitations and ex-        copyright directives derives from the different legal
                       ceptions provided in the        traditions in the Member States. Although optional

                                                       Especially concerning the exception for private copy-
                                                       ing, the different implementation causes considerable
                                                       problems in the Single Market (see our answers in
                                                       section IV). In general it can be said, that the different
                                                       systems in the Member States create large obstacles
                                                       in cross border trade (e.g. grey market, distortion of
                                                       competition etc. – see answer to question 27). Many
                                                       services, companies and innovators rely on the exist-
                                                       ence of specific exceptions and limitations of copyright.
                                                       Such services cannot be offered EU wide and a single
                                                       market is not available to them.
                                                       Cross border cloud services for instance demand a
                                                       harmonized pan European legal framework. This ap-
                                                       plies from a content licensing perspective as well as
                                                       from a consumer perspective. It is important, that the
                                                       same legal framework exist in order to ensure, that a
                                                       service, which is legal in one member state can also
                                                       be offered in another member state.

                                                    Here is another example: Library may offer access to
                                                    archives to citizens in one member state but are not be
                                                    able to do so in other Member States due to the lack of
                                                    a respective exception of copyright. A university may
                                                    use copyright protected material for the purpose of
                                                    teaching in one member state on the basis of a re-
                                                    spective exception but might not be able to do so in
                                                    another member state.
                                                    A fragmentation of limitations and exception is also
                                                    worrying because many of them are based on funda-
                                                    mental rights that are part of EU law and which do not
                                                    stop at borders. Citizens and consumers should have
                                                    the same fundamental rights in Europe.

                    22. Should some/all of the      answer: YES
                    exceptions be made man-         Generally we think that a higher level of harmonization
                    datory and, if so, is there a   is needed to reduce the problems mentioned above. In
                    need for a higher level of      the introduction of this section it is stated, that only
                    harmonisation of such           some of the exceptions are mandatory. The exception
                    exceptions?                     Article 5 (1) of the Directive 2001/29/EC for example
                                                    determines that certain temporary acts of reproduction
                                                    do not belong to the reproduction right of the author.
                                                    This exception assures for instance the lawful use of a
                                                    work in the digital world. In the same way it is possible
                                                    to think about a mandatory private copying exception.
                                                    Such mandatory private copying exception could only
                                                    be introduced based on the model planned in the UK.
                                                    The UK government proposes to introduce a narrow
                                                    private copying exception which causes no significant
                                                    harm to right holders. Consequently, no further com-
                                                    pensation will be due to rights holders. As a mandatory
                                                    exception it would harmonize the framework for private
                                                    copying in the EU and enable a competitive digital
                                                    Single Market.
                                                    The need for mandatory exceptions should be as-
                                                    sessed taking into account in particular whether (i)
                                                    there is a detrimental impact on the internal market; (ii)
                                                    whether fundamental rights and/or the public interest
                                                    are a strong justification for the exception; and (iii)
                                                    whether an underlying policy (i.e. economic or innova-
                                                    tion policy) is better achieved at EU level.

                                                    In Germany the Federal Court of Justice had to decide
                                                    twice on the legality of the display of thumbnails within
                                                    image search services (Bundesgerichtshof, “Vor-
                                                    schaubilder I“, GRUR 2010, 628; Bundesgerichtshof,

                                                    doubt that those services are in the interest of the
                                                    public as well as the right holders. Without such ser-
                                                    vices images could not be found on the internet. Still
                                                    the German Federal Supreme Court could not find any
                                                    existing copyright exception even though the service is
                                                    in accordance with the purpose of copyright to allow

                                                    scientific progress. This case demonstrates clearly the
                                                    need for a flexible exception clause that provides suffi-

                                                    socially beneficial and do not prejudice any legitimate
                                                    interest of the rights holder. In regard to the two cases

                                                    implied consent theory. However, a copyright internal
                                                    solution is needed going forward.
                                                    At the same time our concerns raised in question 27
                                                    have to be taken into account.


                    24. Independently from the      answer: YES
                    questions above, is there a
                    need to provide for a

                                                     (iii) Copyright levies cause many problems regarding

                                                           tion within the EU and also in every Member
                                                           State. For example in Germany high tariffs for
                                                           USB-Sticks and memory cards resulting a large
                                                           grey market. For collecting societies it is impossi-
                                                           ble to control all commodity flows especially in
                                                           storage media (e.g. distribution via big trucks).
                                                           This means a distortion of competition on the
                                                           German market. Second the export of a product
                                                           to another Member State leads to the problem of
                                                           high administrative reimbursement schemes and
                                                           often the levy is paid double at the end.
                                                     (iv) Considering the many problems caused by the
                                                           implementation of compensation schemes, the
                                                           European Commission should present options to
                                                           reform and simplify the system, which would pave
                                                           the way for the abolition of copyright levies and
                                                           eventually their replacement by alternative sys-

                                                 New digital technologies have stimulated creativity and

                                                 copyright. A future copyright should allow the creation

                                                 agree. However, we would like to point out that this
                                                 issue is broader than just an exception and will require

                                                 signed with content created ‘professionally’ are at odds

                                                 becoming creators of content. Convergence is leading
                                                 to the development of new applications building on the
                                                 capacity of ICT to involve users in content creation and
                                                 distribution. Web 2.0 applications such as blogs, pod-
                                                 casts, wiki, or video sharing, enable users easily to
                                                 create and share text, videos or pictures, and to play a
                                                 more active and collaborative role in content creation
                                                 and knowledge dissemination.
                                                 However, there is a significant difference between
                                                 user-created content and existing content that is simp-

                                                 yright. In an OECD study, user-created content was
                                                 defined as "content made publicly available over the
                                                 Internet, which reflects a certain amount of creative
                                                 effort, and which is created outside of professional
                                                 routines and practices" (Participative Web and User-
                                                 Created Content, OECD 2007, p. 9.).
                                                 The Directive does not currently contain an exception
                                                 which would allow the use of existing copyright pro-
                                                 tected content for creating new or derivative works.
                                                 The obligation to clear rights before any transformative
                                                 content can be made available can be perceived as a

                                                             allowed, so as not to conflict with the economic inter-

                                                             There have been calls for the acceptance of an excep-

                                                             ticular, the Gowers Review recommended that an
                                                             exception be created for "creative, transformative or
                                                             derivative works" (Recommendation 11), within the

                                                             The Review acknowledges that this would be contrary
                                                             to the Directive and accordingly calls for its amend-

                                                             would be to favour innovative uses of works and to
                                                             stimulate the production of added value (The Review

                                                 The classical value chain in the music industry com-
                                                 pulsory contained the production, manufacturing,
                                                 sales/marketing, distribution and retail sales of music
                                                 at a brick and mortar store. Customers had very limited
                                                 technical equipment to conduct private copies of such
                                                 physical storage media. In addition it was impossible to
                                                 identify the user copying such content. Against this
                                                 background it was seen as reasonable approach to
                                                 collect compensation for the private copying exception
                                                 from third parties, i.e. manufacturers and importers of
                                                 the corresponding copying devices. There had been
                                                 two major justifications for approaching named third
                                                 parties:
                                                 (i) there was no other possibility for owners of copy-
                                                       right protected works to receive compensation for
                                                       a possible harm of the primary market and
                                                 (ii) there were no technical possibilities to control
                                                       copying of protected works

                                                 owners have full control not only over the distribution,
                                                 but also over the subsequent copying conducted by

                                                 music companies, which traditionally played an inter-
                                                 mediary role. Social Media platforms partly replace
                                                 expensive promotion campaigns. For example the
                                                 song "Gangnam Style" by PSY became a world-wide

                                                 and the internet have thus disrupted the role of major
                                                 music companies and their relationship with consum-

                                                 works and reach positive spillover effects on the live

                                                 there is a proven substantial harm to right holders. In
                                                 comparison to the world of the 1960s a “harm” by pri-
                                                 vate copying to the primary market can no longer be
                                                 noted. In spite of that, devices and storage media –
                                                 which are often used for storing other than protected
                                                 content – are no longer a suitable connecting factor for
                                                 harm (what remains to be proved). We are living in a
                                                 technical area where relevant copying devices can no
                                                 longer be clearly defined. Mobile phones become
                                                 small PCs, or tablets, TVs serve as video recorder,
                                                 MP3 players do not store content anymore on a HDD
                                                 but instead stream content etc. This leads to the con-
                                                 sequence that the devices are just for play-back. Me-
                                                 dia convergence can also result in increased technical
                                                 protection as in the case of multifunctional TV receiv-
                                                 ers. For example Pay TV providers in Germany offer in
                                                 one product both linear and non-linear viewing with the
                                                 added option of saving content. The device itself does
                                                 not have the technical capacity to allow further copying
                                                 or transfer, thus limiting any potential loss for right
                                                 holders to an absolute minimum. Those are just some
                                                 examples to illustrate that a clear definition of relevant
                                                 hardware equipment is almost impossible, even if key
                                                 criteria would be pre-defined on an EU level. Adminis-
                                                 trative efforts significantly increased over the years
                                                 while at the same time the need for a hardware based
                                                 system ceases to exist following technical improve-
                                                 ments in the area of new business models and DRM.

                                                 These facts show that the technology, the behaviour of
                                                 the users, the marketing behaviour and the right hold-
                                                 er’s possibilities have changed drastically since the
                                                 1960s. Besides these developments there are several
                                                 problems in the current copyright levy system which
                                                 should lead to a change.
                                                 There is no coherence in the way copyright levies are
                                                 determined across the EU. The levies are set arbitrari-
                                                 ly from Member State to Member State. Differences
                                                 apply, inter alia, by hardware product category, by the
                                                 amount of the levy, by the criteria defining the amount
                                                 per category (i.e. by memory capacity or by some
                                                 other applicable criteria) or even with respect to the
                                                 overall mechanism of the system. Also, there is no
                                                 clear guidance how to distinguish business and private
                                                 customers. While it is clarified in theory that business
                                                 customers should not be subject to the levy, industry
                                                 and collection societies are left alone how to effectively
                                                 implement necessary procedures. An effective and
                                                 workable exception of B2B products does not exist
                                                 across the EU and it is unclear if a practical system
                                                 can be established.

                                                 Especially the German copyright levy system contains
                                                 grave deficiencies and doesn’t work at all:
                                                 Trade associations and collecting societies have to
                                                 negotiate levies since the new Copyright Act in 2008.
                                                 Nevertheless currently nearly every tariff published by
                                                 collecting societies is disputed and unclear. In Germa-
                                                 ny there are court cases and negotiations for more
                                                 than 20 devices or media types. Legal and economic
                                                 uncertainty is the consequence for the importers and
                                                 manufacturers who are involved only as a third party.
                                                 Financial impact is even worse. Because of the differ-
                                                 ent levies in all countries around Europe it is hardly
                                                 possible to add the levy to the price of the device
                                                 which was intended when the levy system was imple-
                                                 mented decades ago. As good example for the mal-
                                                 function of the copyright levy system in a Single Mar-
                                                 ket may serve the rates for photocopiers: In France
                                                 they are 0 €, in Germany 87,50 € (maximum levy) and
                                                 in Belgium 1.838,98 € (maximum levy) per unit.
                                                 Collecting societies determine tariffs arbitrarily and not
                                                 on the basis of objective and reliable data. As a result
                                                 importers and manufacturers as third parties have to
                                                 deal with inappropriately high tariffs. Examples: Ger-
                                                 man collecting societies published a levy of 36 € per
                                                 unit for mobile phones. Another example is the incident
                                                 that there existed a tariff for USB-Sticks and memory
                                                 cards until the end of 2011 of 0,10 € per unit. In 2012
                                                 the collecting societies increased their own tariffs by
                                                 1950 % (tariffs up to 1,95 € per unit) without giving any
                                                 reasons.
                                                 Occasionally collecting societies publish tariffs for
                                                 years retroactively. In the case of mobile phones they
                                                 increased an already published tariff retroactively. In
                                                 such cases the levies cannot be passed on to the end
                                                 customer who has already purchased the product with
                                                 the consequence that the purchaser has the economic
                                                 damage.
                                                 The different levy systems within the EU and the inabil-
                                                 ity of the collecting societies to control the market lead
                                                 to a menacing grey market and therefore distortion of
                                                 competition.

                                                 protected works.
                                                 We believe that this fundamental issue cannot be fixed

                                                  where the right-holder chooses to allow his works to be
                                                  copied freely.
                                                  The shift from ownership to access models for online
                                                  content distribution is increasingly relevant, both tech-
                                                  nically and commercially. These models have devel-
                                                  oped well with regard to music and audiovisual works.
                                                  An equally significant change can be observed in to-
                                                  day’s book publishing business, where there has been
                                                  an increasingly important shift from book sales towards
                                                  e-books made available under a license agreement.
                                                  Licensing could become the prevailing business model
                                                  in the near future for a large share of books for which
                                                  private copying is compensated by levies nowadays.
                                                  It is important to recall that the case law of the CJEU
                                                  has already acknowledged that fair compensation is
                                                  only applicable when copying itself has not been au-
                                                  thorized by right- holders, but is made by the user
                                                  under the relevant exception. In particular, the
                                                  Padawan judgment explicitly provides that fair com-
                                                  pensation occurs in case of making private copies
                                                  without the authorization of the right-holders.
                                                  Finally, recital 35 of the Directive 2001/29 describes
                                                  the legal relationship between licensing schemes and
                                                  the private copying exception which underlines the
                                                  aforementioned:
                                                  “In cases where right holders have already received
                                                  payment in some other form, for instance as part of a
                                                  license fee, no specific or separate payment may be
                                                  due. (…) In certain situations where the prejudice to
                                                  the right holder would be minimal, no obligation for
                                                  payment may arise.”

                    66. How would changes in      First of all it seems incomprehensible to extend the

                                                  be noted. Applying the unfair copyright levy system to
                                                  cloud services would result in unjustified triple payment

                                                  nected device, and for the cloud service).
                                                  Further the user behaviour in the context of online
                                                  services shows clearly that not copying is the relevant
                                                  usage but streaming. If no copies are made there is no
                                                  justification for levies.
                                                  One of the main advantages of cloud services is their
                                                  global nature, therefore imposing territorial/national
                                                  levy systems on global services seems unfeasible and
                                                  absurd, especially considering the principles of the
                                                  Single Market. Further it will practicably impossible to
                                                  levy cloud services acting outside of Europe. As con-
                                                  sequence only European services would be obliged to
                                                  pay with the consequence that they will be encouraged
                                                  leaving Europe.
                                                  Cloud computing allows easier access to digital con-

                                                  bution models. In the digital era, consumers need to be
                                                  able to access digital content from several connected
                                                  devices at all times and from anywhere.
                                                  European consumers and internet users would be the
                                                  first victims of the imposition of levies on cloud ser-
                                                  vices since prices would most certainly raise because
                                                  of levies. Companies of all sizes, which are increasing-
                                                  ly using cloud services, would also face this conse-
                                                  quence.
                                                  Imposing levies on cloud services would also have
                                                  negative impact on European cloud service providers,
                                                  as the obligation to pay levies added to new adminis-

                                                  tiveness in the global market. The negative impact on
                                                  new business models would be immediate, as levies
                                                  would raise prices and thus limit the attractiveness,
                                                  competitiveness and future development of business
                                                  models based on new technologies. From a practical
                                                  point of view it would be hardly possible to differentiate
                                                  between cloud services offering only or partly copyright
                                                  protected content and services offering no protected
                                                  content. As consequence every cloud service would
                                                  have to pay a levy independently of what they are
                                                  offering. This would be like a tax on cloud services
                                                  which is unacceptable. Competitive disadvantages and
                                                  legal uncertainty would be the outcome.

                                                 In the other countries the situation is the same. Many
                                                 products qualify as adequate B2C and B2B product at
                                                 the same time. A clear differentiation by product type
                                                 would only be possible in exceptional cases for dedi-
                                                 cated B2B products (e.g. A3 printing devices). For the
                                                 vast majority of products it is rather a marketing deci-
                                                 sion of the manufacturer how to classify them and it
                                                 depends on the type of end-user and the usage which
                                                 device will be bought and finally used for private copy-
                                                 ing or not. For this reason a classification by product
                                                 type is not an adequate criterion for the whole market.
                                                 At the same time there are massive practical hurdles
                                                 to differentiate for individual sales along the supply
                                                 chain. Many manufacturer sell specifically B2B prod-
                                                 ucts through multilevel distribution. It is almost impos-
                                                 sible to document on each level whether or not a levy
                                                 has already been paid in order to allow for an effective
                                                 claim for refund by the B2B customer. Also the import-
                                                 er of the product does not know who is the ultimate
                                                 purchaser and the end-user of the product and is
                                                 therefore required to report and pay full quantities sold
                                                 to the overall market. The only one in the chain who
                                                 knows to whom a product is sold and who could differ-
                                                 entiate between B2B and B2C is the last purchaser
                                                 who sells it to the final customer. Against this back-
                                                 ground it is currently common practice that B2B cus-
                                                 tomers effectively bear the full burden of the levy with-
                                                 out justification. The percentage differs by product
                                                 category. By way of example it can easily reach up to
                                                 50 % which is the documented B2B share for PCs

                                                 accepted and 118 were rejected.

                                                 2012 and €100.971 in 2013. It has to be noted that
                                                 according to market research data each year a total
                                                 reimbursement of €40.000.000 should take place;
                                                 instead only €67.000 was reimbursed in 2012. This
                                                 huge discrepancy illustrates the inefficiency of the
                                                 French reimbursement system.
                                                 Also in Austria the refund system doesn’t work and is
                                                 actually subject matter of the Amazon litigation case.
                                                 Actually the case is back again at the Court of Instance
                                                 in Austria.
                                                 This result shows clearly that the reimbursement sys-
                                                 tem doesn`t work with the consequence that commer-
                                                 cial users are paying a levy although the ECJ clearly
                                                 stated that in case of only commercial usage no levy is
                                                 due.

                                                 right holder. So an alternative would be to establish an
                                                 exemption based on the “fair use-principle” meaning
                                                 that private copying is allowed in a limited scope and
                                                 the rights holder gets his compensation via the price of
                                                 the purchase and no further compensation is due. If
                                                 there would be the decision to compensate the right
                                                 holder in an additional manner – a kind of additional
                                                 “subvention” – then the question of the way of financ-
                                                 ing arises. One possibility could be a payment of fair
                                                 compensation through a State fund.
                                                 This alternative system, which is already in place in

                                                  Indeed there has been a remarkable decline in the
                                                  price for audio-visual, photographic and information
                                                  processing equipment, between December 2011 and
                                                  February 2013, according to official data published by
                                                  INE and EUROSTAT (HICP (Harmonized Index of
                                                  Consumer Prices), “Audio-visual, photographic and

                                                  able. In the period December 2011 - February 2013,
                                                  prices for the above mentioned equipment decreased
                                                  by 12,01% in Spain.
                                                  Another possibility of financing a “subvention” could be
                                                  a user related fee similar to a broadcasting fee per
                                                  user or household. In this case the jurisdiction of the
                                                  ECJ could best be implemented because then it would

                                                  In summary, it can be stated that current private copy-

                                                   Furthermore, the successful shutdown of “kino.to” had
                                                   an international signaling effect that led to “voluntary”

                                                   Since most of the illegal services seek profit from the

                                                 injunctive measures; and the e-Commerce Directive
                                                 ensures that such injunctions cannot result in general
                                                 monitoring obligations.
                                                 We do not feel that a legislative approach is warranted
                                                 at this point, but would welcome clear guidance to EU
                                                 Member States to ensure the correct implementation
                                                 of the existing legal framework. It is in the application

                                                 the circumstances in which injunctions against internet
                                                 intermediaries are appropriate and how the scope of
                                                 such injunctions must be cabined.
                                                 In the past three years the European Court of Justice
                                                 has explicitly dealt with the possible scope of injunc-
                                                 tions against internet intermediaries (e.g. C-324/09
                                                 “L’oreal./.eBay”; C-70/10 “Scarlet Extended”, C-360
                                                 “Sabam/Netlog”) and made clear that such injunctions
                                                 need to be very specific with regards to the measures
                                                 to be taken by intermediaries and must not merely be
                                                 success oriented. For example general filtering sys-

                                                 decisions and clarifications have not been taken into

                                                 national courts. For example, the German Supreme

                                                 clarifications to ensure that the scope is adapted to the
                                                 technical and commercial realities in which intermedi-
                                                 aries operate, and to take into account the interests of
                                                 businesses and consumers who rely on the services of
                                                 intermediaries. In particular, it is important for national
                                                 courts to understand that injunctions must be narrowly
                                                 defined and should only play a very limited role in the
                                                 fight against IP infringements online. Any approach to
                                                 policymaking in this area must recognize that the most
                                                 effective way to deal with IP infringements is through
                                                 cooperation between all stake-holders.

                                                 the availability of the content to users from legal

                                                 Right holders should focus on how to increase offers
                                                 and consumption of legal content. Attractive offers are
                                                 key to increase of legal consumption. As an example,
                                                 films should be made available much sooner after the
                                                 theatrical release date. This requires a rethinking of
                                                 the release windows mechanisms. In a recent study

                                                 piracy than those who did not”. (Spotify report: Adven-

                                                 areas in which more clarity in regard to the interpreta-
                                                 tion of those safe harbors is needed: (i) activities cov-

                                                 ty in those areas is needed. It is important to avoid

                                                 for intermediaries.
                                                 As mentioned the CJEU has provided relevant guide-
                                                 lines how to interpret the Directives in the light of the
                                                 Funda-mental Rights enshrined in the Charta (e.g.

                                                 The CJEU has stipulated the necessity to strike a fair
                                                 balance between the protection of copyright and the
                                                 protection of the fundamental rights of individuals, who
                                                 could be affected by enforcement measures. The latter
                                                 are the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by

                                                 the fundamental rights of that ISP’s customers, namely
                                                 their right to protection of their personal data and their
                                                 freedom to receive or impart information, which are
                                                 rights safeguarded by Art. 8 and 11 of the Charter.
                                                 In the context of the right balance we would like to

                                                 However, Germany has implemented in § 101 II and IX
                                                 of the German Copyright Act, that the Right to Infor-

                                                 Directive). The practical knowledge shows the utmost

                                                   vider has to judge himself whether the rights owner
                                                   has the right to sue or not and as a consequence is
                                                   claiming legitimately the data requested. Very often the
                                                   examination of the right to sue is very difficult, due to
                                                   complex licensing systems.

                                                 However, in Germany in terms of Section 20b of the
                                                 German Copyright Act it is controversial, if the simulta-
                                                 neous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission of an
                                                 initial broadcast via a transmission path which is not
                                                 cable or microwave (e.g. via the Internet or mobile
                                                 communication networks) is covered by Section 20b of
                                                 the German Copyright Act. The crucial point of the
                                                 dispute is the question, if Section 20b of the German
                                                 Copyright Act has to be interpreted in a technological
                                                 neutral way.
                                                 In Germany, the District Court of Hamburg denied in
                                                 the so called “Zattoo Case” in 2009 (Decision from
                                                 April 8th, 2009 (AZ 308 O 660/08) the applicability of
                                                 Section 20b of the German Copyright Act with regard
                                                 to the transmission of live TV channels over the Inter-
                                                 net, although the transmission was done over a cable
                                                 system.
                                                 In our view there is no obvious reason, why similar
                                                 services (the transmission of live TV channels to end
                                                 user for reception on end user devices) should be
                                                 treated in different ways. The interest situation be-
                                                 tween a traditional cable operator and an Internet Ser-
                                                 vice Provider is identical. The specific transmission
                                                 path (e.g. Mobile Networks, Internet) should be irrele-
                                                 vant. All cases where a live TV Channel is transmitted
                                                 simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged should be
                                                 considered as a “cable” retransmission within the
                                                 meaning of the Directive.
                                                 The legal situation in Austria is clear since the Deci-
                                                 sion of the Austrian Oberstes Gerichtshof from August
                                                 28th, 2008. (Ob 89/08d). In this decision the court
                                                 made clear, that the wireless retransmission of live TV
                                                 Channels over mobile networks on mobile devices has
                                                 to be considered as a “cable retransmission”. Although
                                                 Section 59a UrhG of the Austrian Copy Right Act is
                                                 based on the same Directive, different legal opinions
                                                 exist in Europe.
                                                 Therefore there is an urgent need to clarify on a Euro-
                                                 pean level that the Directive has to be interpreted in a
                                                 technological neutral way in order to ensure, that sce-
                                                 narios (e.g. retransmission via the Internet / Mobile
                                                 Networks), which are comparable with the traditional

                                                 cable retransmission, are treated in the same way with
                                                 regard to the acquisition of the rights. Otherwise, it will
                                                 be difficult to establish cross border TV services in
                                                 Europe.

                                                 Orphan Works:
                                                 We welcome the Directive 2012/28. However, the
                                                 directive will not achieve the goal of endorsing the
                                                 digitisation of orphan works unless rules are intro-
                                                 duced that support public private partnerships. Im-
                                                 mense investments have to be made for the digitisa-
                                                 tion. Therefore, it is necessary that the beneficiaries
                                                 may generate revenues. Recital 22 of the Directive
                                                 shows that the European Union is aware that mass
                                                 digitisation is impossible to achieve without private
                                                 partners. They have the knowhow and resources to
                                                 manage such projects. No private partners will join
                                                 such projects if no incentives are offered to them. So
                                                 far the Directive contains no incentives for private
                                                 parties to engage in digitisation projects since the
                                                 Directive currently does not provide for private third
                                                 parties to get rights to use the resulting digital copies.
                                                 Moreover, the range cultural heritage protected by
                                                 copyright and/or neighbouring right cannot be limited
                                                 to writing or audiovisual works. A large number of
                                                 photographies are orphan (the British Museum out-
                                                 lined that a right holder could not be identified in 90%
                                                 of the photographies stored in its archive). Valuable
                                                 heritage is vanishing in archives.
