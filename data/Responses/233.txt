   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]





   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


NON





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


NON

L'UE devrait  se  préoccuper  avant  tout  de  garantir  la  protection  des
auteurs, sans lesquels il n'y aurait  tout  simplement  pas  d'oeuvre,  puis
permettre, en fonction  de  cette  protection,  l'accès  transfrontalier  en
obligeant éditeurs et producteurs à mettre en ligne l'intégralité  de  leurs
catalogues.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]





The act of “making available”





   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


YES




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[1])?


€





Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation





  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?














Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


YES

Pour  les  mêmes  raisons  que,  sauf  disposition  particulière,  quiconque
possédant un bien devrait être informé - pour  le  moins  -  de  la  mise  à
disposition (gratuite ou non) de ce bien par autrui.




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


YES


Idem réponse 11.





Download to own digital content




  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


YES


DRM (dans le passé), conditions générales d'iTunes  et  autres  services  de
cloud.


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

Il  n'y  a  jamais  revente,  vu  que  l'original  est  conservable  par  le
"vendeur". Il y a tout au plus multiplication.

 Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]






How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers





  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]



  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

YES

More than ever, anything aimed at granting creators the  means   to  make  a
decent living out of their creation is of prime importance.  Protecting  the
creator and his work is protecting the end-consumer  I  am,  in  giving  the
creator the incentive to keep on feeding me with his work, and  letting  him
and his family live out of it, just as I would wish my baker's family  could
carry on living out of the very bakery that fed  me  in  his  lifetime.  The
current protection should not only be kept  in  its  actual  perimeter,  but
even prolonged a  couple  decades  further:  this  is  a  radical  move  we,
europeans, should be proud of.

€


  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market




21. Are there problems arising from the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
    exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
    Member States?

€

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
    there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES


Yes if and only if harmonisation can level things up, i.e. aiming at  rather
much less exceptions. Protection  should  remain  the  norm,  and  exception
remain what it is: an exception.


€



23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or  removed  from
    the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


No, current directives and laws are more than self-efficient.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide  for
    a greater degree of flexibility in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
    limitations and exceptions?

NO

Same as answer 22.

25. If yes, what would be the best approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
    (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions
    of  the  directives,  interpretations  by  the   Commission,   built-in
    flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the  relative
    advantages and disadvantages  of  such  an  approach  as  well  as  its
    possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
    experience, constitute a problem?

NO


€


27. In the event that limitations and exceptions  established  at  national
    level were to have cross-border effect,  how  should  the  question  of
    “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
    exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]


Access to content in libraries and archives



Preservation and archiving





28. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
    experienced specific problems  when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
    preserve and archive specific works or other  subject  matter  in  your
    collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
    should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

 [Open question]

Off-premises access to library collections



32.  (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
    experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  with
    rights holders that enable you  to  provide  remote  access,  including
    across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of
    research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?

NO


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]


33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]



34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
    should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]


35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

E – lending



36.  (a) [In particular  if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
    specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the
    electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of  books  or
    other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

NO

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?




€


37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What  differences  do
    you see in the management of physical and online collections, including
    providing  access  to  your  subscribers?  What   problems   have   you
    encountered?

[Open question]

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you  see
    between  libraries’  traditional   activities   such   as   on-premises
    consultation or public lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises
    (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems  have
    you encountered?

[Open question]




Mass digitisation




40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to
    engage in mass digitisation projects,  a  right  holder,  a  collective
    management organisation:] Would it be  necessary  in  your  country  to
    enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU  (i.e. the
    agreements concluded between libraries and collecting  societies)  have
    a cross-border effect so that out of commerce  works  can  be  accessed
    across the EU?





41. Would it be necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
    agreed for other types of content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
    collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€











Teaching




42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an  institutional
    user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use  works
    or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across
    borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?




43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

    content for illustration for  teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
    they?

[Open question]

    its main elements? Which activities  of  the  beneficiary  institutions
    should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]

[Open question]

57. Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute

[Open question]


User-generated content




58. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
    experienced problems when trying to use  pre-existing  works  or  other
    subject matter to disseminate new content on  the  Internet,  including
    across borders?


NON (Je n’ai jamais essayé, je croyais que c’était illégal !)


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?





59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder:]
    Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the  work  you
    have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is   properly
    identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient  in  this
    context?


NON


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?


€


60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):]
    Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use
    of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?


 (b) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


€€ NO

I  never  had  trouble  finding  the  rightholders,  in  order  to  properly
negotiate the terms of use of their works.  In  very  rarely  cases  when  I
could not find them, I just refrained using the  work,  just  like  I  would
refrain using someone's property, being physical or not, without his or  her
prior consent, as simple as that.

€


61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]


By a pan-eutopean harmonisation of collecting societies databases, and  full
catalogue mandatory online availability by the producers and publishers.





62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed,  what  would  be
    its main elements? Which activities should be covered  and  under  what
    conditions?

[Open question]
X Ref answer 61

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]
No solution to a non-existing problem, as this is in no way  different  from
the use of pre-existing material which, ever since  the  advent  of  digital
sampling, has  generally  been  subject  to  formal  contractual  licensing.
Massification of a trend is no legitimate base for new  exception,  just  as
peer-to-peer massification is no base for legalisation either.


 III. Private copying and reprography


64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope  and
    application of the private copying and reprography exceptions[2] in the
    digital environment?

NO

There is nothing obscure about it,  it  only  needs  global  advertising  if
anything: it is the only viable and modern way to grant  us,  end-consumers,
to get from creators the myraids of works we legally got from them  and  are
so adamant to duplicate on all our terminals, by allowing  them  to  get  an
income from that very duplicating  act  and,  therefore,  live  and  produce
more.  It  stands  as  the  perfect  system,  fully  compliant  with  modern
technology, with room for large improvement in scope as well as in ratios.

If anything, one should investigate how to precisley trace  which  work  has
actually been  duplicated,  without  causing  any  breach  in  private  life
protection, for proper income distribution. That is  a  technical  challenge
worth spending time and money over.




65. Should digital copies made by end users for  private  purposes  in  the
    context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and  where
    the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to  private  copying
    levies?[3]

X YES


Naturally, ref answer 64.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to  online
    services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,   for
    instance, users  to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
    development and functioning of new business models on the one hand  and
    rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


Ref answer 64.

67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the  invoices
    for products subject to levies?[4]

YES


Yes, so we, end-users,  can  be  proud  of  contributing  to  the  digitized
creation.


€


68. Have you experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
    resulted in undue levy payments, or  duplicate  payments  of  the  same
    levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ NO


69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons  other
    than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying?
    Do any of those transactions result in undue payments?  Please  explain
    in  detail  the  example  you  provide  (type  of  products,  type   of
    transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]


70. Where such undue payments arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
    affect? To what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
    reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the
    situation?

[Open question]


71. If you have identified specific problems with the  current  functioning
    of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]


  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


72. [In particular if you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
    mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive  an
    adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of   your   works   and
    performances?

[Open question]

73. Is there a need to act at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
    certain clauses in contracts)?


74. If you consider that the current rules are not  effective,  what  would
    you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

   V. Respect for rights



75. Should the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
    efficient for infringements of copyright committed  with  a  commercial
    purpose?

 YES

Of course, as this can prevent those of us, end-users  running  by  the  law
and supporting creation, from feeling robbed by those who are not.

In particular, is the current legal framework  clear  enough  to  allow  for
sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such   as   Internet   service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?


[Open question]

Ref answer 80.



76. Does the current civil enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
    balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected
    and other rights such as the protection of private life and  protection
    of personal data?









  VI. A single EU Copyright Title


77. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright  Title,
    as a means of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
    exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as  a  single  framework
    for enforcement?

YES if and only if, harmonisation can be run in the direction of the  french
author's right, rather than this of the copyright. In other  words,  no  and
absolutely no, if it means levelling things down. If  not  for  its  current
growth,  Europe  is  being  madly  sought  after  for  its  values  and  its
dedication to the human rights, among which cultural diversity  and  freedom
of speech always prevailed. Let's make sure those whom we  spiritually  feed
and shape our identity from can make a decent living out of  their  lifelong
dedication.




78. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU?
    Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation
    mean that this is a longer term project?

 VII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

79. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework
    for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters  should  be
    addressed.

[Open question]

I really wished I had seen at least one of your  questions  being  aimed  at
how  to  force  the  digital  giants  to  substantially  contribute  to  the
digitizable creation, rather than trying to make ennemies  out  of  creators
once more.


For much too long now, this civil war has been diverting us  from  the  only
question  worth  beeing  asked:  how   to   technically,   juridically   and
economically  create  a  pan-european  system,  simple,   intelligible   and
transparent to all, that would turn any entreprise (in  software,  hardware,
services et all) benefiting  from  the  fact  that,  we  the  end-consumers,
inevitably seek for faster, simpler and cheaper  access  to  works,  into  a
MANDATORY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DIGITIZABLE ARTS, to the best of  its  capacity
naturally, yet in a manner that should only prove substantial, otherwise  it
would have to cease its activities as they would only prove  detrimental  to
the creators of the works they vastly permit access to (if they were to  pay
what films and music are really worth, would the current streaming  services
be running on a viable economic model ?)


As an end-consumer, I cannot tolerate any longer to see those  who  dedicate
their lives to our cultural wealth being treated as simple adjusment  values
of an industry bound to grow  flamboyant,  as  constantly  promised  by  the
digital giants to our european leaders, saving them from hard  working  over
the  burdens  of  a  much  needed  fiscal  harmonisation  which,   if   ever
established, could, just on its own, lead to a better balance and  a  fairer
transfer in values, from the digital to the creative world  it  indisputably
depends on.


Innovation is vehicle for growth, no doubt. But author's rights are not  the
braking system, way to the  contrary,  they  are  the  engine.  As  an  end-
consumer, I'll say it proud and loud: make it stronger !
