   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

  NO
  NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
It is the business of record companies to make as much music available to EU consumers as
possible through the most consumer friendly models. The UK is a great example of this
with around 70 legal online digital music services, more than any country in the world. It
has achieved this under the current Directive framework and with technology companies
that have licensed music on commercial terms.
As a consequence, over 37 million recordings are available on legal online music services,
and that music is available across the EU. Record companies grant EU-wide cross-border
licences and, indeed in some cases, worldwide licences. Record companies encourage legal
online music services to launch as soon as possible and in as many countries as possible;
our business model is to make our content available to as many customers as possible.
Many of those services start with a licence in the UK, to market test, and then seek
markets in other European, or global, territories as they seek to expand.
The UK digital music market has grown extremely fast over the past few years (by more
than 185% in the last five years; and by more than 13,000% in ten years) and now accounts
for 50% of record label trade revenue, and more than £500 million of consumer spend in
the UK annually.
Music services are portable across borders, allowing subscribers to streaming services to
travel with full access to their service, and to consult services and playlists in other
countries.


                                                                                           3
The most significant obstacle to a fully functioning market in legal online services is the
huge and unfair competition from illegal online services. The ubiquity of such illegal
services and ease with which they can be accessed makes it extremely difficult for legal
services to compete and to stand a chance of reaching their full potential.
See BPI’s response in Section VI (Respect for rights).

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
The territorial arrangements for copyright are not a barrier to gaining multi-territorial
licences. Where they have the rights, record companies regularly grant, directly or via
collective management organisations representing their rights, EU-wide cross-border
licences for the copyrights in sound recordings.
As set out in BPI’s response to Question 2, typically, legal online music services may
choose specifically to be licensed in the UK to test their business proposition given the
vibrancy of the UK market. Following this they might seek licences in other attractive
territories, and then consider launching EU-wide or in other countries. For instance, O2
started with a UK licence and then took a New Zealand licence. The cost of rolling out a
new service across the whole of the EU can be prohibitive from a marketing/commercial
aspect and this is probably why the practice shows that many legal platforms elect to roll
out services on a gradual country-by-country basis. BPI assumes this is for commercial
reasons and the need for platforms to adapt their services to consumers’ needs and tastes
in each country.
Even the biggest global companies with huge resources, such as Apple and Google, have
staggered their roll outs despite multi-territory licensing deals. Like any business, legal
online services need to manage their growth. There are a number of business reasons for
this, including, amongst others, trying out new business models (requiring time and
significant resources), high infrastructure costs (setting up local offices, marketing and
communication), the need to establish local partnerships with ISPs and advertisers, the
need for a local presence to provide locally targeted editorial content in the national
language, and the need to establish distribution, reporting and payment systems.
IFPI presented information during the European Commission’s “Licences for Europe”
initiative and its working groups, to show the way in which the music industry has
revolutionised its business. The UK is a leader in service innovation in a Europe that is
becoming the principal creative centre for the music business globally.
Legal online music services have achieved incredible scale in a short period in the UK and
also in Europe.




                                                                                            4
The music sector is a major actor in the UK’s cultural economy and in particular shows a
high percentage of youth employment and highly skilled jobs which are crucial drivers of
economic growth and global competitiveness in today’s difficult economic environment.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
The consultation process should be careful to ensure that it is considering the question of
what is best for long term competition in legal online services, and the benefit of
consumers in the long term (including prices). The decision by legal services to roll-out on a
country-by-country basis is not due to obstacles created by copyright, but reflects
commercial and financial decisions made by those services. The very nature of copyright
enables one Member State to be used as a test-bed for innovative new legal services
without requiring those services to take an EU-wide licence. The crucial problem remains
online copyright infringement. This should be addressed by applying more efficient pan-
European enforcement measures and remedies. (See the BPI response to Questions 75 &
76).
The UK music industry, and the wider content sector, provides information tools which
help to raise awareness of the available legal services. The BPI has a website
www.whymusicmatters.org which gives information on legally available music services.
The Alliance for IP also has a website, http://www.thecontentmap.com/, which gives
information of how to access legal services across the creative content industries.
The IFPI has a consumer service at http://www.pro-music.org/ which provides full
information about legal online music services available across Europe which helps
consumers to navigate the various music offers in various territories.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
Record companies make repertoire available in all markets where they have the rights to
do so. The only reason why rights might not be granted is if the companies do not hold
rights in certain countries. The fact that rights are territorially defined should not be
confused with territorial restrictions. As explained above, BPI’s members license rights on
a cross-border basis.


  NO OPINION

                                                                                            5
6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
Not applicable – see response to Question 5 (above).

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
As explained above, there is no barrier to cross-territorial licensing of music content, and it
is regularly undertaken. The UK has more legal online music services than any country in
the world, and many of these services seek to grow in other territories inside and outside
of the EU following successful UK growth.
Nothing in the current framework precludes the licensing of rights on a pan-European
basis and the growth of legal services across Europe, as explained in BPI’s response to
Question 3. Licensing is extremely flexible and services are licenced in a way that suits
them, and suits the consumers they are targeting. Placing restrictions on the terms by
which services can license content would be damaging for competition in digital markets
and therefore damaging for consumers.
The legal online music services have been built on the current EU copyright framework,
which shows that the framework is able to support the growth of the digital economy in
the EU.
  NO OPINION
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
See response to Question 9.



                                                                                             6
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach1)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief2)?
    YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no need to clarify the territorial scope of the communication to the public right,
which derives from international treaties and has been interpreted by European and
national law (both statutory and case law). BPI’s members’ rights are frequently licensed
on a multi-territory basis, and we have not encountered any practical difficulties due to
possible differences existing in the national rules on authorship/ownership or transfer of
rights.
As regards enforcement of the communication to the public right, recent European and
national case law has helped clarify the position that legal action can be taken both in the
country where the illegal service’s servers are hosted as well as in the country where the
illegal service can be accessed.
Illegal online services tend not to host their servers in the UK and/or they regularly move
hosting countries. Accordingly, taking direct action against illegal services in the UK tends
to be cost-prohibitive and ineffective. What has proved to be effective (albeit costly) are
the Article 8(3) website blocking injunctions, where the High Court has declared that the
operators of the illegal sites (and the users of those sites) are liable for communication to
the public in the UK. Please see BPI’s response to Question 75.
The introduction of a so-called “country-of-origin” principle or an “exploitation/targeted
public” principle in the EU-wide legislation would not improve the availability of legal
online services, which are already widely offered in Europe, as explained in BPI’s response
to Questions 2 and 3, and can create other problems. The “country-of-origin” principle for
online licensing, for instance, would lead to forum-shopping, as also concluded in the
Commission’s Study on the Application of the Information Society Directive (p. 182). This
would not improve the current situation, where digital services and content are already
widely available across Europe. Such changes would also make enforcement against illegal
sites more difficult.
1
  The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
2
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


There is no problem in the market for the licensing of rights, which is flexible to all
arrangements.
  NO OPINION

3. Linking and browsing
11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
This is a question that is open to misunderstanding and misinterpretation; and it highlights
the problems for creative and innovative legal online services in an unfair market full of
illegal services. Certainly rights holders do not object to hyperlinks directing users to legal
sources of music, but they do object where hyperlinks direct users to illegal sources of
music. In those circumstances, BPI believes that hyperlinking should be subject to the
authorisation of the rights holders.
This was confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case (C-466/12), where the Court
concluded that linking, in certain circumstances, constitutes communication to the public.
The CJEU stated that linking is permitted, provided that the original content has been
made available with the authorisation of the rights holders, and that the content is not
communicated to a new public (i.e. to a public that was not taken into account by the
copyright holders when they authorised the initial communication to the public). On the
other hand, linking to content that the rights holder has made available only to a limited
audience, or has ceased to make available, would constitute an act of communication to
the public.




                                                                                                    8
The Svensson decision also means that authorisation for linking does not extend to links to
copies that have been made available without the permission of the rights holders. For
instance, linking to a copy that was made available by a third party without the consent of
the right holder would clearly violate the right of communication to the public (aggregator
sites that aggregate links to infringing pieces of content is an example of this).
BPI has sent nearly 60 million notices to Google to remove illegal links from its search
engine. This includes links to sites that have now been blocked by ISPs following High
Court orders in the UK. BPI continues to maintain that where such links are to illegal sites,
they constitute an act of communication to the public which is not authorised by rights
holders.
The CJEU judgement in the Svensson case and other cases at national level indicate that
the broad definition of the communication to the public right should be maintained,
otherwise rights holders may be deprived of remedies against these forms of piracy.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO OPINION




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


The Copyright Directive at Article 5(1) provides that no authorisation is required for the
temporary reproduction of a work (a) for transmission by an intermediary and (b) for
lawful use. Under this clear statement of law, protection has been given to rights holders
without inhibiting legitimate internet services.


   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

   3. Download to own digital content
13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Permitting the resale of digital content would inevitably result in significantly reduced
revenues for authors, performers and producers of that content. The availability of a
second hand market for perfect reproductions of the original with low transaction costs
would potentially have calamitous effects on retailers and producers of content.
Consumers who, in the past, would not have considered purchasing used records, books,
films, etc. will be much more likely to make such purchases when: (1) digital files by their
very nature remain in perfect condition so that the used file is of equal quality (and utility)
to a new file, and (2) such files can be searched for and transmitted instantaneously at no
cost (other than the cost of purchase).
Consumers can “try before they buy” so there is no offset to loss aversion that comes from
the potential for a second hand sale and, once someone has purchased the digital content
it becomes a sunk cost, and so their desired price from a second hand price will potentially
be very low.
The likely result would be that, even if total sales for a particular record, book, film, etc.
did not decline, more and more of those sales would result in absolutely no revenues to
the creators of those works and the price of “original” copies sold by or with the
authorisation of the creators would decline in order to be competitive with the prices for
resale copies. With the potential for very high amounts of available secondary content, the
price would inevitably be very low.
The combination of fewer sales producing revenue for creators and lower prices on those
sales that do produce such revenue would make it increasingly difficult for individuals and
companies to make a living or a profit from the sale of original content and to maintain
their levels of investment in generating new creative content in Europe. UK record labels
alone invest more than 20% of their turnover, more than £160 million every year, in
“A&R”, the process of identifying and nurturing new talent and making new recordings.
This investment would not be possible if revenues were to fall because a consumer resale
right undermined sales of new copies of recordings.
In addition, if a consumer wishes to resell his or her digital content it is virtually impossible
to ensure that a consumer deletes the digital content from their device(s) before reselling
it and it is possible that consumers could retain a copy on their device undetected. Digital
                                                                                              10
content providers could develop tools to prevent a consumer from continuing to use
digital content i.e. deleting content remotely or introducing access pins, however these
would be difficult and costly to enforce in practice. Even if there was a legal requirement
that the consumer removes content this is extremely difficult to enforce and verify,
particularly given that there is no technical protection measures applied to a la carte
download services for music. The application of “forward and delete” rules would require
complex technical solutions, and BPI is not aware of such solutions at this stage that would
be either effective or robust enough to prevent circumvention.
It is for all of these very good reasons that the current distinction is made between
physical products and digital copies.
Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
  YES
  NO
Identifiers, and information about ownership and rights are subject to market-led
solutions, on a global level and on a case by case basis, where a business need arises,
therefore the creation of an EU registration system is unnecessary. A system imposed by
legislation carries significant risks for the market including additional administrative
burdens, added infrastructure and IT costs and potential conflict with existing market
solutions. BPI would, however, urge the EU to support initiatives such as the Global
Repertoire Database and the UK’s own Copyright Hub to help market led solutions to
easing licensing transactions.
Market led solutions, such as the Copyright Hub in the UK and the Global Repertoire
Database are much more likely to be tailored to the needs of producers and users alike, as
they will be built around the practical experience of licensing deals in the market place.
Any new proposals from the EU for its own bespoke registration scheme are likely to
impact on the speed and viability of current industry led initiatives.

A.     How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
As set out in BPI’s response to Question 15, the UK has been working on establishing a
“Copyright Hub” to ensure that users wishing to license works can be easily signposted to
the appropriate rights holder. The UK Music industry is closely involved in the work to set
up the Global Repertoire Database which will be wider than the EU in its reach and
application, as it will provide a single, comprehensive and authoritative representation of
the global ownership and control of musical works. The EU should put its efforts into
support for market based licensing initiatives such as the Copyright Hub and the Global
Repertoire database to ease the transaction costs of licensing, whilst recognising that
licensing is the best solution to ensure the supply of copyright works and to ensure that
new services to consumers can launch.
BPI believes that the Commission could help by:
(1) Working with industry and other stakeholders to ensure that foundation work is put in
place to help towards common standards – such as the work undertaken by the Linked
Content Coalition (LCC Framework, http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org).
(2) Allow market activity to shape developments around database interoperability. In
some cases, industry alone can drive developments, as with company databases and data
quality improvements. In some instances a partnership between industry and standards-
setting bodies is more appropriate: for example the current plans to work with ISO on
revising the ISRC standard.

B.     Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain
The EU has just been through a lengthy process of debate leading to the extension of
copyright in sound recordings from 50 to 70 years. This was a welcome and sensible
conclusion to a long period of discussion but is still a shorter period than some other
competitor territories.
The 70-year term takes into account the longer lives of performers, be they the featured
artist, or session musicians, and brings the protection closer to that afforded to authors,
who benefit from life plus 70 years protection. A 70-year term for sound recordings
ensures that artists are protected and can earn remuneration later in life, and it also
ensures that artists continue to benefit from their creations. In addition to the extended
term of protection, artists can benefit from additional measures provided for under EU law
and national legislation. With the digital music world growing and evolving constantly,

                                                                                        12
new music is re-digitised and made available to consumers, who often rediscover old
classics. This is breathing new life into old material.
Extra income generated in the extended term is directly re-invested in discovering,
nurturing and promoting new musical talent in Europe, ensuring continued cultural
diversity as well as more opportunities for young performers. BPI’s members reinvest 20%
of revenues into new music, a very high level of investment in creative content.
It is worth remembering that copyright protection in no way hinders innovation, but
rather rewards it. Having a longer term means that when a musical work is exploited, its
creators benefit. Copyright protected works are available in many digital forms (including
freemium models), and allow artists to earn a living. Works in the public domain are also
sold digitally in the same manner, the only difference being that the creator would get
nothing.

  II.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
The exceptions in the EU copyright legislation are drafted in a flexible way and
accommodate a large variety of digital uses. There is a degree of variation in exceptions
among the Member States due to their optional character, however, in most cases these
variations are of little or no practical consequence. This is due to the fact that the main
exceptions (disabled persons, libraries, education, press, quotation) have been
implemented in all Member States. Also, many exceptions (e.g. museums and prisons,
repair of equipment, architectural works, etc) have no cross-border impact.
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

                                                                                        13
  NO – Please explain
The consultation does not set out an evidence base that leads to any conclusions that
there is a problem here to be resolved. Rights holders know of no problems with the
current arrangements and license many services without this being a barrier to those
deals. If the Commission believes there is a problem in lack of harmonisation, it needs to
provide an evidence based analysis of what the problems, if any, are and whether there
are any solutions that would have greater benefits than costs.
This was the conclusion of the Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information Society
Directive which noted that exceptions are derogations from the rights of creators, and
they need to be applied and interpreted strictly.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Existing exceptions already provide a large degree of flexibility and are able to
accommodate new uses online. For the rest, BPI believes that licensing solutions are the
most flexible and fastest way to accommodate new digital uses, knowing that many of
these uses have a commercial impact. The music industry is open to discussing ways to
ensure that the market continues to develop in a manner benefiting both consumers and
rights holders. This should be done on the basis of clear evidence and economic analysis.
As mentioned above under Question 22, the need for any new exceptions should be
properly researched and a clear case made that the benefits will, overall, outweigh the
costs.
User-generated content (“UGC”) has commercial impact and value, and BPI’s member
companies do license UGC. Record companies are licensing platforms directly and users
can embed any UGC onto their sites, blogs, etc., with a link to a platform. The introduction
of a new exception for UGC is therefore not necessary, and would deprive creators from
revenues, without significantly benefiting end-users. There is also the possibility that an
exception for UGC would reduce the rights of end-users to the control of and
remuneration for their personal content that they upload onto social media sites.
See also BPI response to Questions 58-63 on User-Generated Content.



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why



                                                                                         14
The existing exceptions already provide for a large degree of flexibility. Member States
have some room to implement exceptions in a more specific manner, where necessary.
The CJEU provides interpretation of the EU-wide concepts. More flexibility in the form of
an open-ended exception would neither provide legal certainty nor more harmonisation at
EU level. The three-step test should remain, as it is the ultimate safety net for the right
holders and it is a condition for the flexibility of the scope of certain exceptions listed in
the Copyright Directive.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
BPI has not faced any practical problems because of the territoriality of limitations and
exceptions.
  NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Assuming that a particular act has an effect in more than one country and is subject to an
exception that requires compensation, compensation arising from the harm suffered in
each country should be paid to the person or entity that holds the rights in that particular
country, and should be paid by the person whose acts caused the harm in that country.

A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?

                                                                                            15
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
  YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In BPI’s view, there is no need for exceptions or limitations, or for any extension of the
existing exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes
should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be
implemented and adapted much quicker than legislation.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]

There is no need for a legislative solution; see BPI’s response to Question 29.

31.      If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the quickest and the most flexible way of resolving these problems.

      4. Off-premises access to library collections
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?




                                                                                          16
The UK already provides a functioning example of a licensing mechanism. The Educational
Recording Agency (“ERA”) grants licences to institutions in accordance with a Licensing
Scheme, which has been certified by the Secretary of State. The licences issued by ERA
under Section 35 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 authorise the following
activities:
- Recording from broadcasts made in the UK of the works and performances owned or
represented by ERA members for non-commercial and educational uses.
- Electronic communication of licenced recordings within an educational establishment
(including distance learning).
The licence fee is divided up between all creators and right holders that are involved who
have signed up to the ERA scheme.
The system works for users (i.e. educational establishments) as a convenient licensing
mechanism as well as for the creators and right holders of the works that are included in a
broadcast. Collective management organisations have had the infrastructure in place to
deal with the ERA licence since 1990.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need for exceptions or limitations, or for any extension of the existing
exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes should
be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be implemented
and adapted faster than legislation.
Moreover, there is no need for such exceptions and limitations in relation to music
because access to music is already ubiquitous and inexpensive due to developments in the
marketplace. There is a very large amount of catalogue that can be listened to without
charge on legal online music services.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
There is no need for a legislative solution; see BPI’s response to Question 33.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the most optimal solution; see BPI’s response to Question 33.

5.     E – lending
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?

                                                                                        17
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
The wide availability of digital music services, including in particular those operating a
“freemium” model means that any exception for e-lending is unnecessary. Consumers can
access more than 25 million tracks for free, funded by the inclusion of advertising.
Lending electronically must be considered in a different way to lending physically, where
there are perfectly sensible licensing schemes in place and rules for lending. E-lending by
public institutions could compete directly with legal music services that are offered on a
marketplace at various forms and points. Unlicensed E-lending would provide users with
totally substitutable content at zero, or very low cost which would cause significant harm
to normal commercial exploitation by producers and sales by retailers. These activities
should be dealt with by the market place and should be subject to licences.
Publicly funded libraries should not be in a position to compete directly with commercial
legal content services. This will not only damage the price for right holders but also
prevent the development of commercial digital services in the content sector.


  NO OPINION

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
There is no need for exceptions or limitations, also for any extension of the existing
exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes should
be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be implemented
and adapted faster than legislation.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



                                                                                             18
39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
It should be pointed out that when libraries start making works available online, they are
competing directly with commercial market offerings. There are no barriers to access and,
therefore, there is little justification for exceptions and limitations. Lending only works
when demand can be reasonably managed. Other content providers may use digital rights
management, as music does not apply DRM it would not be able to restrict access in any
meaningful way.

6.       Mass digitisation
40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties to the agreement. There
is no problem of digitisation to overcome in music.
     NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO – Please explain
BPI’s members are able to license their content directly; no additional schemes or
mechanisms are needed.

B.       Teaching
42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?


                                                                                            19
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION

43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need for an extension of any existing exceptions.
BPI agrees with the conclusions of the authors of the Commission’s Study on the 2001
Information Society Directive that the exception for teaching and research (Article 5.3(a) of
the Directive) has been formulated openly, i.e. that e-learning is included in the scope of
the exception. The Study points out that the issue is that the national laws implementing
the Directive show a restrictive transposition and diverging conditions. BPI agrees with the
opinion expressed in the Study that the best option to address and solve the divergences
would be to require Member States to meet the aim of the exception, especially when it
concerns cross-border teaching and research.
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

Today, consumers enjoy creating content with a combination of images, text and music
content, often using somebody else’s content that is protected by copyright. This is usually
described as “User Generated Content”. In practice, the greatest majority of UGC uses
significant portions of pre-existing works which are protected by copyright. For instance,
users combine a family video with a pre-existing music track, or apply new lyrics to a
popular music video.




                                                                                           23
User Generated Content accounts for a significant proportion of the content available on
video streaming platforms. The record industry actively licenses UGC platforms that make
available new content based on sound recordings and music videos created by the record
labels. These licences are provided on a cross-border basis. They are granted to the
platforms themselves, which avoids the need for users which post content that includes
material protected by copyright to ask for individual licences. In other words, the act of
making the UGC – including the underlying right holder’s work – available is covered by the
licence to the platform.
It also gives the record companies the possibility to monetise their content by sharing
some of the proceeds obtained by the licensed platforms from advertisements that appear
alongside the UGC. Today, a platform such as YouTube is the third largest source of digital
revenues for the music industry.
The licences given by the companies also enable the posting (i.e. embedding) of UGC by
users on their own blogs or websites, thereby extending the authorised uses beyond the
platforms themselves. This enables users who wish to show their UGC on their own blogs
and websites to do so by posting the UGC on a licenced platform and then “embedding”
the video on their blog or website. This makes it appear as though the video is hosted on
their site although in fact it is hosted on the UGC platform. This is beneficial to the user,
who can take advantage of the user-friendly tools that are generally provided by the
platforms that are probably easier for most people to use than the tools they would use to
upload the videos on their own blogs or websites directly. It is also beneficial to right
holders because they are able to exercise different options to monetise the content.


  NO OPINION


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
Protected recordings can be identified by automatic content recognition technology (such
as YouTube’s Content ID and Audible Magic’s automated content recognition system) and
can be associated with the appropriate right holder. This means that the relevant right
holders can be remunerated, and enables them to request that particular UGC – such as
those which are harmful or offensive, or violate the moral rights of the performers – be
taken down from the platform.


                                                                                           24
Members are licensing the making available of UGC, providing a legal environment for
consumers, while preserving their right to be compensated for uses of their copyright
material when it generates revenue for the platforms. If there is a problem with UGC
content, those platforms can seek a licence. The fact that some platforms either refuse to
enter into a licence, or that companies refuse to grant such a licence (for whatever reason)
should not be a reason to create an exception.
It should be noted, as well, that creators of UGC that does not incorporate copyrighted
work, or that becomes a copyright work in its own right will benefit from the rights
subsisting in copyright works (i.e. the benefits surrounding ownership and control of the
work, as well as the prospect of being remunerated for content that they have created).
This is an issue that end-users that are creators of UGC uploaded onto social media
platforms may also feel strongly about.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As explained above, the use of UGC is solved by licensing online platforms. This provides a
legal environment for consumers who make UGC available online, while enabling right
holders to monetise their content. If there is a lack of awareness from consumers on the
existence of licences, this could be improved by better information from the platforms.
62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
BPI does not believe that a legislative solution is needed. UGC is being managed
successfully by licensing. On the contrary, some of the legislative solutions mentioned,
such as en exception for UGC, would be unnecessary and highly prejudicial.




                                                                                         25
BPI believes that the existing law makes it clear that one who uses another person’s work
requires, except in rare and rather narrowly defined cases, the permission of the copyright
holder. There is no reason to change the law in that respect, especially when the rights
holders have relied on that law to enter into licences that facilitate the dissemination of
UGC, while at the same time respecting the economic and moral rights of creators.
In contrast, an exception for UGC would render the existing licence system meaningless,
and would deprive rights holders, and uploaders of content, of revenues they are currently
obtaining and have the right to. The principal beneficiaries of an exception would not be
the consumers, for whom nothing would change in comparison to the current situation,
but a number of big platforms which would be able to receive the proceeds of advertising
for UGC without paying any remuneration to the owners of the content. This would lead to
vast amounts of value being transferred from the creators of copyrighted content, to a
market dominated by a small number of very large technology companies. This
distributional effect is both economically and socially unjust.
BPI agrees with the recently published Study On The Application of Directive 2001/29/EC
on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society that was prepared for the
Commission that there do not appear to be “sufficient problems in practice to justify” a
UGC specific exception (p. 542 of the Study). The Study also notes that there is reason to
believe that another legislative alternative to introduce more flexibility into the list of
exceptions “will practically give rise to more questions than it will answer and will lead to
increased litigation”, that it could well lead to “unexpected but undesired results,” and
that “it is likely that it would have an adverse impact on the functioning of the Internal
Market” (p. 541 of the Study).



63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As BPI has explained above, the market is accommodating the use of UGC. Users who wish
to disseminate UGC using pre-existing music may do so by making their creations available
through licenced platforms, which provide the benefit of remunerating the performers and
producers of the underlying works and respecting the moral rights of the performers and,
in relatively infrequent cases, requiring the takedown of offensive UGC that incorporate
pre-existing recordings.
As mentioned above, if there is a lack of awareness from the consumers on the existence
of licences, this could be improved by better information from the platforms.

    III.      Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions3 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain

    Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                          26
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    NO – Please explain
The EU Copyright Directive provides for clear exceptions for copyright and reprography.
The private copying exception, in particular, makes clear that the exception is limited to
individual, non-commercial uses, with no copying by third parties. We are not aware of
problems and case-law relating to the actual scope of the exception, except for the issue of
legal source, which is going to be clarified by the CJEU in the near future.
    NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licenced by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?4
    YES – Please explain
BPI has not called for levies on consumer equipment as there is, currently, no private
copying exception in the UK. BPI believes, however, that the current EU law is clear that
there has to be fair compensation where there is harm from private copying.
BPI agrees that copies licensed by the right holders should not be subject to private
copying levies. For the copies that have not been licensed by the right holders and that
are made on the basis of a private copying exception provided in national law, fair
compensation must therefore be granted under Article 5(2)(b) of the EU Copyright
Directive.
       – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
BPI believes that if an exception applied to “cloud services”, it would interfere significantly
with an emerging digital licensing market and would require substantial compensation.
BPI observes that a large variety of legal online music services, some of which rely on cloud
technology such as Spotify, Deezer, iTunes Match, Amazon AutoRip, have developed in the
last few years and are licenced services; more legal services are emerging, and we would
leave the development of those legal services up to the market.

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          27
Cloud services in particular, involve for the largest majority the setting up of a database
and the making available of the copies of the content on such a database to consumers.
These activities require a licence from the right holders, and such licences have been
granted to services such as iTunes. BPI would argue that copies made “in the cloud” with
such services do not and cannot fall under the scope of private copying.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?5
    YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    NO – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    NO OPINION
The UK does not, currently have a private copying exception so BPI does not have
experience of the operation of the levy system.


68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
    NO – Please explain
BPI is not aware of cases of double payments. This is probably due to the fact that the
different EU countries have systems of exemptions or refund schemes in the case of export
or transit of products subject to levies.
The Opus judgment of the CJEU (case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus Supplies,
16 June 2011) recently clarified that, in cases of distant sales occurring from one EU
Member State to consumers located in another EU Member State where a private copying
exception and levies are in place, the distant seller should be liable for the payment of the
levy applicable in the Member State where the consumer is located. Consequently, it is for
the State where right holders suffer from the harm caused by private copying to ensure
the effective recovery of the levy, irrespective of whether the media retailer is established
in the same Member State or in a different Member State.

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          28
This decision confirmed what already applies to the offline environment. In BPI’s view the
export or exemption schemes can also be applied in the case of online sales of equipment
and devices in order to avoid any possible double payments.
  NO OPINION

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]


As the private copying exception does not currently apply in the UK, BPI has no experience
of the administration of a levy scheme.

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
As above, BPI has no experience of the functioning of the levy system as there is currently
no private copying exception in the UK.

 IV.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The grant of exclusive rights to producers is essential to enable them to take the significant
financial investment risks they make in an industry where there is no guarantee of success.
Furthermore, this gives them the ability to enforce those rights against infringing parties.




                                                                                           29
The best measure the EU can take to ensure that authors, producers and performers are
properly remunerated is to tackle piracy. The remuneration of authors, performers and
producers has been devastated by piracy. Sales of music have almost halved as a direct
consequence. In order to substantially increase revenue for performers and authors the EU
needs to provide adequate legislation to enable producers and publishers, on behalf of
performers and authors, to fully tackle the piracy which has caused, and continues to
cause, so much damage to the industry.
Contractual freedom of all parties involved is and continues to be the best mechanism for
addressing remuneration of performers. The decline in revenue over the last few years
comes directly from the impact of piracy, not from the contractual relationship between
producer and performer. Indeed, royalty rates to featured performers have increased
significantly over the last ten years. Nonetheless, total royalties paid to performers have
been impacted by the substantial decline in recorded music revenues due to piracy.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
See the response to Question 72. There is no need for the EU to take action in this regard,
as existing EU and national law and judicial precedents already provide protection against
unfair contractual practices. In the music sector, the best guarantee for fair contractual
practices is the competitive pressure resulting from the fact that, with new digital
production and distribution technologies, the barrier to entry to the market is very low. In
addition, artists are free to either release their recordings themselves or to enter into
agreements with labels to release the artist’s recordings on the best contractual terms
possible. The artist’s negotiating position in such instances is based on the consumer
demand for their music. In the event that a label is unable or unwilling to provide an artist
with satisfactory contractual terms, or applies unfair practices, such a label would struggle
in the competitive market place. Eventually such labels would simply disappear from the
market place as they would not be able to sign new acts or retain existing acts.
  NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
BPI believes that a system that guarantees contractual freedom is the best means to
achieve fairness and fair contractual practice. BPI does not believe that detailed rules
interfering with the parties’ freedom to contract or introducing artificial restrictions upon
the parties will benefit anyone, as ultimately, they would reduce the production of new
creative content to the detriment of right holders and consumers.



                                                                                          30
  V.      Respect for rights
75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES – Please explain
Internet piracy, including downloading and sharing/distributing content via peer to peer
networks, remains a significant problem for the future development of the European legal
online market for content. Recent research from Ofcom, the independent communications
regulator in the UK, showed one in six (17%) UK internet users aged 12+ consumed at least
one item of online content illegally over a three-month period from March–May 2013. This
equates to approximately 7.4 million consumers of illegal content.
Ofcom estimated that, during the three-month period covered by their study, 199 million
music tracks, 54 million TV programmes, 30 million films, 9 million items of computer
software, 7 million e-books and 5 million video games were consumed illegally.
This level of illegal activity is a barrier to a functioning market for content, a barrier to
entry for new, innovative, legal online content services and for the future investment in
content that is clearly in demand from consumers.
The BPI has taken expensive (but effective) legal action in the UK under the UK’s
implementation of Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive and obtained High Court Orders
requiring the UK’s six largest ISPs to block 25 major illegal websites. But despite this, the
illegal sites are still promoted by links from search engines and are available in other
member states.
The civil enforcement system in the EU and its Member States should be made more
efficient so that rights holders and creators can easily, quickly and properly enforce their
rights and deal with illegal distribution of their intellectual property. In particular in
respect of the following aspects:
- Cross-border injunctions should be allowed. Online copyright infringement cases typically
involve a cross-border element with sites and services being available in more than one
country, or having connection (e.g. operators, ISPs) with multiple jurisdictions. Often rights
holders are required to take multiple actions against the same infringing service (e.g. The
Article 8(3) website blocking injunction in the UK in relation to The Pirate Bay has had to
be replicated, at cost in other Member States), and there is currently no procedure to
enable claims in different countries to be consolidated in one jurisdiction. One option to
remedy this situation would be to allow an injunction against a specific service obtained in
one Member State to be enforced in another Member State, either directly or by way of an
expedited procedure.
- Article 8(3) Copyright Directive (which corresponds to Article 11 Enforcement Directive)
should be properly implemented in all European Member States.
- Provisions on damages should be improved to meet their purpose: (i) rights holders have
to be adequately compensated for the loss suffered, and (ii) infringers (and other potential
infringers) have to be deterred.




                                                                                           31
Additionally, statutory pre-established damages for copyright infringement, as in the US,
would create a significant deterrent to copyright infringement and go a long way to
helping clean up the online environment in the UK. BPI does not believe that
compensatory damages establish a genuine deterrent to piracy. Infringers know that in
the event that they face legal action, they will only be required to pay the licence fee that
would have been required in any event. This encourages, rather than deters, unlicensed
use of music.


  NO – Please explain

  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
BPI strongly believes that businesses that are part of the digital economy must have
responsibilities as well as rights, playing their part to help the legal ecommerce sector to
grow while marginalising the online black market. The Commission should ensure that it
has the right framework in place to ensure that legitimate businesses take all reasonable
steps not to promote or support illegal activity where they have a reasonable degree of
evidence of systematic infringement.
In the UK significant progress has been made on a voluntary basis with advertisers and
payment providers but we have a serious outstanding problem that when consumers
search for downloads of their favourite artists, search engines still overwhelmingly point
people towards illegal content, some of which is on sites that have been blocked by the
High Court in the UK following an injunction under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988.
Recent Ofcom research found that “44% of all internet users aged 12+ claimed to be either
‘not particularly confident’ or ‘not at all’ confident in what is legal and what isn’t online.”
Search engines have a vital role to play in helping consumers towards legal online content.
BPI sends in excess of 2 million notices per month to Google and a similar quantity are sent
by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Without exception, the notices
sent are in relation to sites which encourage and promote large scale infringement of
copyright. BPI sent Google its first take-down notice in May 2010. As of March 2014, the
total number of 'take-down' notices sent by BPI to Google - requesting them to remove
URL links to copy-right-infringing content, exceeds 65 million.




                                                                                            32
Where there is a site that has been objectively found to be infringing on a mass scale, BPI
believes that until such a site can prove it is acting legitimately, legal entities should not
trade with (including serving advertising on such sites) or promote such sites through
search links. The system of notice and takedown that rights holders use to notify sites of
infringement could be the basis of providing such actual knowledge to intermediaries.
However, it is vital that sites and intermediaries are more active and not only operate a
notice and takedown procedure responding to notices of infringement but operate a
notice and stay down procedure instead. The removal of individual items of infringing
content is ultimately ineffective in addressing the online piracy problem due to the sheer
volume of infringements that appear and re-appear when infringing content is reposted
after being removed. BPI is of the strong opinion that notice and takedown is only
effective in relation to legitimate sites which inadvertently infringe copyright on an
infrequent basis.
The EU should consider amending its legislative framework to underpin this responsibility,
ensuring intermediaries accept certain responsibilities in tackling the problem where they
have knowledge that a site infringes on a mass scale: search engines should stop directing
consumers to infringing content; advertisers/ad networks should stop serving
advertisements to infringing sites that make substantial sums from unlicenced content;
and payment providers should be required to stop providing payment services to illegal
sites and services.
The protection against liability under the E-Commerce safe harbour regime should only
apply to “truly neutral intermediaries”. The most serious problem right holders encounter
with notice and take down is that many of the platforms and services seeking to take
advantage of the safe harbours in Article 14 are not properly within the definition of
hosting service provider, nor are they true intermediaries (e.g. unlicenced locker services
and BitTorrent sites). The reality is that many of these services are structurally infringing
sites, whose business model depends on right holders not being able to locate and notify
infringing URLs fast enough before they are re-posted. However, according to ECJ case law
and the EU legislative framework, protection against liability can only granted to “merely
technical, automatic and passive” services – this should be further clarified.
ISPs should be required to keep public databases (e.g. Domain Tools, RIPE) updated to
allow right holders to identify which ISP is providing the internet service. The vast bulk of
the online piracy problem originates from sites and services in respect of which there is no
identified corporate entity or individual against whom civil litigation can be commenced.
The difficulties which right holders face – beyond the above mentioned lack of a legal
method to obtain the details – are (1) incorrect or fake details, or even no details displayed
on public databases such as the RIPE database or Domain Tools, and (2) incorrect or fake
details held by ISPs. In addition, sites move from one ISP to another very quickly in order
to evade enforcement. Unless ISPs are required to keep public databases accurate and up
to date, right holders are deprived of any means to identify responsible persons behind
infringing services.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

                                                                                           33
  YES – Please explain
The balance between copyright enforcement and protection of private life and personal
data has extensively been addressed in case law (e.g. Promusicae) and in underlying
legislation.
  NO – Please explain

    VI. A single EU Copyright Title

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
BPI does not see what benefit a single EU Copyright Title would provide, and how it could
be put into practice. A single EU Title makes sense in the field of rights which are obtained
on the basis of a registration (such as patents or trademarks). The very nature of those
industrial property rights is different from copyright, as their protection itself depends on
the registration system, which includes the examination of the subject matter (e.g. a sign,
or an invention) to be protected. For these rights, a single title is an alternative to long and
expensive multiple registration procedures in individual Member States.
Copyright is inherently different as it is not based on a registration procedure and arises
from the creation of a work. If a single EU copyright title was introduced as an optional
system to be applied on top of national copyright systems, BPI does not think that it would
be adopted, because it would duplicate the protection which already exists at national
level and across Europe. On the other hand, if such a title was mandatory, this would
require a full harmonisation of copyright throughout the EU, which is neither necessary
nor achievable.


  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]




                                                                                             34
The core legal framework underlying the online music market, in particular the Copyright
Directive which sets out the necessary rights and the protection of technology in the
digital environment, is generally satisfactory, sufficiently harmonised at EU level, and
provides in general an acceptable degree of legal certainty as well as flexibility for the
future. Efforts should concentrate on the proper implementation and enforcement of this
vital framework.
