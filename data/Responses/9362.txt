 II.       Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.      Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]
1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to
access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general,
music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)
There are a number of factors that need to the considered before offering a service and/or content
in a particular territory that go beyond the clearance of all necessary rights. Service providers
offering services across Europe are still faced with legal uncertainly and territorial fragmentation as
divergences remain in a number of areas such as consumer protection laws, national rating systems,
child protection obligations, and promotion of local content that necessitates service providers to
develop market-specific offerings.

Furthermore, there are additional requirements/restrictions that are placed on the content that go
beyond the acquisition of appropriate licences that are imposed on rights-holders and by national
legislation. For example, release windows remain standard industry practice. This is particularly true
for the AVMS sector but there are cases also in the music industry. Dubbing requirements, national
censorship laws i.e. “blacklist content”, divergent copyright regimes that go beyond licensing (i.e.
private copying regimes) all also can result in the need for service providers to direct consumers to
the local website, in order to be fully legally compliant.

For music, content licensors determine the countries in which they make their content available,
subject to the limitations of where service providers have a music store and where the licensor
controls the necessary rights. Even if a licensor has given a service provider its entire catalogue
across all countries, release dates may vary by territory, so the content would not all be available at
the same time.

For movies, the situation is even more complicated as distribution rights are more fragmented.
Rights in a movie are generally owned by different licensors on a territory by territory basis. There
are also windowing arrangements in effect for different platform types in some EU territories
meaning it is not always possible to offer video on demand for the full period of an agreement with
any given licensor. This means that, similar to music, even if rights in a single movie are granted
across all Member States, it will not necessarily be available in all Member States at the same time.
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
provide online services across borders in the EU?
YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other
issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across borders, compliance
with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and


                                                                                                     3
TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software).
Licensing of digital services has undergone considerable change in recent years and market-led
developments continue. EDiMA also recognises that the CRM Directive attempted to address many
of the complexities regarding licensing linked to working with Collective Rights Management
Organisations in Europe. However, there remains a need for the system to be improved further.
     Repertoire Transparency: In order to provide a comprehensive pan-European music service,
        licensees still need to secure rights from all national societies in all Member States for their
        respective member repertoires, as well as repertoires from outside the EU, resulting in a
        significant number of licences that are required for coverage of all repertoires. The market
        needs a reliable mechanism to enable rights holders to aggregate their repertoires so that
        the number of licenses needed is reasonable while at the same time avoiding the creation of
        super-monopolies. The complexity and lack of transparency in rights ownership has,
        however, led to significant uncertainty in the securing of rights. It is still not necessarily clear
        by whom certain rights are held, leading to possible double payments by licensees for the
        same right. Promoting better repertoire transparency – and providing support for
        corresponding initiatives such as the Global Rights Database (GRD) – should continue to be
        pursued as a priority.
     A well-functioning and flexible market-based licensing regime is critical to the promotion
        of cultural diversity in Europe and to the development of a dynamic and successful new
        media sector. Recent developments in securing licences for audio and audio/visual works
        have significantly changed the licensing processes and the landscape of associated rights.
        These changes have in some instances encouraged the development of new business models
        but have also led to increased compliance and liability costs. Indeed, the simple cost of
        administering a licence has challenged the viability of some online business models at a time
        when the industry must cut costs in order to remain competitive. The high administrative
        costs of licensing have caused some providers to exit the market, removing revenue from the
        content sector. More change is necessary to encourage the market to adjust to the realities
        of the online world, to respond to unmet consumer demand and to deliver economies of
        scale.
6, [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in
cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would
still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order
for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
Such restrictions may still be necessary depending on certain factors of the service – e.g. tailored
regional and/or cultural offerings for a select geography or language group – and may also exist as a
result of other regulatory or legal considerations. Restrictions on certain forms of content in some
jurisdictions, censorship or blacklisting, varying national VAT regimes, different consumer protection
laws, windowing times for certain audio/visual content, etc., can all result in the necessary restriction
of a particular service to a certain territory or Member State.




                                                                                                          4
B.       Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or
not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

1.      The act of “making available”
8, Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO
The difficulties surrounding the right of making available can be attributed to two facts: 1) The
transposition of the reference in the 1996 WIPO Treaties that specifies the right of communication to
the public - the making available of a right - without giving any guidance how it should work in the
digital environment; and 2). The continuation of a century old territorial and analogue-based
administration of rights seeking to ‘fit’ new digital uses into old categories of rights.

Multiple payments or an inability to license leading to fragmentation and underserved markets are
obvious consequences. For example, a video platform could be charged for multiple rights:
reproduction, communication to the public, and making available, while due to disputes about where
the video is “made available” and who owns what rights in which territories, the video cannot be
exploited in a number of Member States. Too often, in territories where there are different collecting
societies or licensors administering each right, each one wants to be paid for the same activity by
claiming that separate rights are implicated, including rights that have no independent economic
value. One might claim royalties for the act of simply loading files to a server connected to the
Internet, even if no one ever accesses those files. Another might claim royalties for the act of
transmission, while a third would do the same for the reproduction right even in the absence of
downloads because temporary copies are made as a necessary adjunct of the transmission.
Businesses cannot be expected to efficiently conclude commercial contracts in such circumstances.

In a functional licensing market, distinguishing between rights does not make sense where there is a
single act of exploitation. A contract might cite all the relevant rights - reproduction, communication
to the public, making available, distribution - but could more generally state that the license would
convey all rights necessary to use the work community-wide. Thus, in a well-functioning market,
online music services would be striking licenses with copyright owners for all required rights and all
EU territories. The objective is not to pay less, but instead to eliminate transaction costs and
deadweight loss, as a multitude of local gatekeepers create fragmentation.

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
10, [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a
single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems
for you?
YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g.
facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the
"bundling of rights")
EDiMA sees no justification for the copyright of a musical work contained in a download to be split
into two separate pieces (i.e. separate reproduction and performance rights), but if that is to be the
case in the EU, we would prefer to see that the two rights must always be licensed together in the
same license and by the same rightholder as we advocated in the context of the adoption of the CRM
Directive. In other words, the collecting society mandates should correspond to categories of actual

                                                                                                      5
economic uses of online services, and not to abstractly defined rights inherited from offline business
models. Online rights would thus be mandated together to the same entity. An alternative could be a
requirement that only collecting societies representing both the mechanical and performing rights
can license on a multi-territorial or pan-European basis. We also consider it appropriate that a rights
holder may select which society represents their rights and may withdraw their rights, provided that
in both cases a rights holder selects the same society (or pair of societies, where each society
represents only one right) to represent both online rights.

3.        Linking and browsing
11, Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public –
or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Whether the referrals to the EUCJ, this Consultation, pledges by various publishers to grant
permissions for linking in the course of ‘Licences for Europe’, or attempts to introduce new rights
against linking, it is perhaps a concern that such basic questions, concerning well established
practices, are still being considered today.

Under no circumstances should linking be subject to the authorisation of a rightholder. We believe
any other answer would undermine the Internet and have nefarious social and economic
consequences.

As underlined by the opinion of many scholars under the ‘European Copyright Society’1, this would
amount to a significant expansion of copyright and seriously undermine freedom of expression. As
Tim-Berners Lee explained, a standard hyperlink is nothing more than a reference or footnote, and
that the ability to refer to a document is a fundamental right of free speech2.

From a copyright perspective, a link is not a use of a work in copyright law as it is neither a
transmission nor a communication. There is no new public, as a link merely points to content already
made available.

12, Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the
user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?
NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Everyday interactions of users with digital technology give rise to multiple temporary digital
reproductions of fragments of content. These are essential to the functioning of digital technologies,
devices, networks, etc. The answer to these questions is critical.

First, the temporary reproductions that occur when viewing a web-page are transient and incidental,
form an integral and essential part of a technological process, have the sole purpose of enabling a

                                                                                                     6
lawful use of the work and have no independent economic significance. This therefore falls within
the terms of Article 5.1(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC, and therefore qualifies as a mandatory exception,
so no authorisation is required.

Second, is quite clear that, according to the UK Supreme Court in the Newspaper Licensing Agency
case3 and some academics4, requiring permission from the newspaper licensing agency for such uses
would break down the Internet and “would make infringers of many millions of ordinary users of the
Internet across the EU”5.

Third, this would have broad implications about the ‘right to read’. Requiring permission from the
newspaper licensing agency for browsers and screens literally subjects the right to read content
already available to new and additional permissions. In the analogue world, reading a book does not
involve intermediate technical reproduction; in the digital world, any network, software, e-reader or
tablet uses temporary reproductions which could be blocked by a rightholder. According to the UK
Supreme Court, “Merely viewing or reading [a work] is not an infringement”, and “it has never been
an infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an infringing article
in physical form”6.

Fourth, there would be obvious consequences in subjecting reading materials online to such
additional rightholder control, for the right to impact information and the right of the public to
receive it, as protected under the Charter.

Last but not least, this is common sense. The notion that under EU law the question of whether
copies invisible to users should trigger new permissions or payments highlights that the copyright
system is liable to being abused with overbroad claims. It is also a serious threat and burden on
innovation in Europe, as digital technologies almost by definition rely on temporary reproductions for
their operation.

4.      Download to own digital content
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of
providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please
specify per market (type of content) concerned.
EDiMA recognises that this is a complex issue and, as the Commission highlights, raises a number of
difficult questions. As such, and given the nascent nature of the business models exploring this space,
we believe this is an area which warrants much further consideration and analysis prior to any
potential legislative attention. EDiMA looks forward to contributing its experiences and collaborating
with the Commission in any analysis and consideration of policy related to the resale of previously
purchased digital content.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing
of works and other subject matter?
YES

  Paras 1 and 36,

Works registries would dramatically improve licensing. Registries could for instance be Berne
compliant, voluntary but accompanied by sufficient regulatory incentives to encourage rightholders
to register their works. At this early stage, many issues would require further consideration, such as,
who would administer a registry, where would it be located, what would be its territorial scope, etc.
We would welcome further discussions on this issue.

As the Commission wrote in its Recommendation of 27 October 2011 on the digitisation and online
accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation: "Rights information databases connected at
European level can bring down transaction costs for rights clearance".

It is quite obvious that no market can be efficiently organised when no information, or only partial
information, is available on who owns the property rights in question. You cannot license a
copyrighted work unless you know who owns the relevant right.

This common sense point has been widely known for a very long time. Yet, despite many good faith
efforts to conclude voluntary rights databases, these efforts have yet to deliver. Currently, society as
a whole is bearing the cost of lack of clarity on ownership of rights; for instance, trademark owners
indirectly subsidise the current efforts to document orphan works. 7
16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Registries would have the advantage of facilitating licensing and improving legal certainty. The full
advantages of registries go beyond licensing.

As pointed out by several stakeholders, technology sheds new light on the potential value of
registries. The vast expansion creation of new content has resulted in everyday activities being
caught up within the copyright system. For instance, WordPress users produce about 36.3 million
new posts and 63.1 million new comments every month. 130 hours of video are uploaded to
YouTube every minute. 758 million photos are shared everyday on the Internet and there are more
than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia, working on more than 22,000,000 articles in 285
languages.

The vast majority of this content is not created with a view e.g. to commercialisation or strict
enforcement. Systematically applying copyright rules designed for commercial exploitation to this
creativity makes little sense, and creates huge legal uncertainty for users and rightholders alike8.
Registries – open to all creators, whether professional or not – would be an interesting way of better
articulating the co-existence of these different forms of creativity, both of which are worthy and
provide more legal certainty to all actors involved. Registering creative content might, for instance,
signal that the owner intends to enforce his copyright strictly and exploit it commercially.

Other advantages of registries are well documented by WIPO9: (1) Right owners will have a simple
and effective means to clearly establish authorship and/or ownership that can be used in commercial
and legal contexts; (2) Registration can also help to delimit the public domain and consequently
facilitate access to creative content for which no authorisation from the right owner is needed; (3)
National registries serve the public interest by providing a source of national statistics on creativity

  i.e. under the Directive on orphan works (Directive 2012/28/EU), OHIM administers a database of diligent
searches for potential orphan works, under Article 3(6) of the Directive.

and culture; (4) Finally, national registries may constitute a repository of cultural works through
deposit.

17, What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

An independently run registration system that is too complex or expensive will not attract sufficient
rights holders to be valuable. At the same time, unless there is a mix of incentives, a registry is also
unlikely to attract attention and buy-in.

The Creative Commons experience has shown that it is possible to build a simple platform, without
much funds, where millions of works are “signalled” on a voluntary basis

18, What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

To improve the situation, incentives for rightholders to use such registries would be an important
step in the right direction. Such incentives could include regulatory incentives which are compatible
with the Berne convention10.

At this early stage, more consideration would be required to determine what incentives might be
available. It is worth mentioning, however, that from a legal perspective, possibilities do exist within
the scope of the Berne convention, despite some often exaggerated claims to the contrary.

For instance, a cursory survey of current law reveals that for domestic works, registration might be a
condition for bringing certain infringements. Other subject matter such as phonograms, broadcasts,
unoriginal databases, etc., are not outside of the scope of the Berne Convention.

Similarly, ‘Berne plus’ protection is not, by definition, constrained by the Berne Convention whether
in respect of domestic or non-domestic works. As an illustration, the protection of TPMs, DRM are
not mandated by Berne. Likewise, take down notices are not regulated under the Berne Convention.

Further, in some countries, prima facie evidence of ownership of rights is subject to securing a
certificate of registration. In Canada, and a number of other countries11, for example, a certificate of
registration provides evidence that the copyright exists and that the person registered is the owner
of the copyright.

Finally, the ‘exercise’ of rights is routinely subject to formalities (e.g. French law on how copyright
contracts are to be formalised). Likewise, collecting societies can be required, in certain countries, to
have fully transparent registries as a condition for enforcing their rights.

Accordingly, we believe the EU could provide strong incentives for the ownership of works to be
better and more fully documented at the EU level. It could, for instance, require that collecting
societies do not enforce rights which are not documented in a public database12. It could also limit
the availability of remedies when works are not registered, such as certain enforcement remedies,
take downs notifications or the protection of TPM.

D.          How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
19, What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector,
and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?
The EU should continue its efforts in support of the Global Repertoire Database efforts for which
many companies and rightholders have spent much time and effort on in the last years. This was
instigated by Vice President Neelie Kroes and needs EU support and promotion. While there was
considerable momentum for this initiative while the CRM Directive was under discussion, this
momentum seems to be withering. The EU should envisage measures to ensure that the GRD is
implemented.

However, ‘permissions databases’ are an entirely different matter. They should not distract from the
fact that the major problem faced by online service providers is not lack of interoperability of
rightholder databases, but rather lack of transparency, openness and ultimately the quality and
quantity of the data available. In other words, addressing interoperability of databases before they
are populated with quality data, and made open, is putting the cart before the horse.

Permissions databases also aim to contain licensing information which is machine readable. We do
not believe that this would be a positive development, for the following reasons:
    - Licensing agreements are complex deals, the terms of which are negotiated to reflect the
        needs of a service (beyond financial terms). It is unlikely that there will ever be an
        ‘automatic’ process to replace commercial negotiations.
    - Innovative services are by definition new services: it is difficult to see how unilaterally set
        permissions could foresee the needs of such new services.
    - A declaratory system of permissions, set unilaterally by rightholders, encourages abuse: if
        rightholders can define themselves the conditions of licences (permissions) they are likely to
        state there should be a license when the work is not subject to protection (lack of originality),
        out of protection (public domain), subject to an exception.

Given the previous experience of TPMs, and given the need to prioritise transparent ownership
databases for markets to function effectively, we believe the risks inherent in permissions database
far outweigh any advantages.

We also note that in the course of Licences for Europe, proposals were made to require users to use
identifiers for User Generated Content (UGC). Given the scale of UGC, as well as the implications for
privacy and anonymity, we do not believe that such proposals should be considered.

     III.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
21, Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the
EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The difficulties in cross-border situations generally stem from the fact that copyright is territorial and
limitations are optional and different from one MS to the next. It should also mentioned that the
creation of new IPRs, at the national level, contributes to the creation of new obstacles to the single
market and is questionable given the harmonisation of rights – as indicated recently by the Court
Case C-466/12 Svensson.



                                                                                                       10
Optional exceptions in some cases can give rise to a number of issues:
     -   Limitations on the free movement of goods and services: How can an arts reseller promote
         the sale of artistic works online when some Member States have enacted the relevant
         exception but others have not?
     -   Protection of fundamental rights: some exceptions are intimately connected with
         fundamental rights (quotations, parodies, etc.). These rights do not stop at the border,
         European citizens and consumers should arguably have the same rights in this respect.
     -   Complexity: There are, technically, 2.097.152 different ways to implement the Directive’s
         provisions on exceptions.13
     -   Competitiveness: the economies of scale and consumer reach that could be achieved
         through a digital single market are not available to consumers, companies, services,
         innovators that rely on exceptions and limitations.

22, Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes, some.

The need for mandatory exceptions should be assessed on a case by case basis taking into account, in
particular, whether (1) there is a detrimental impact on the internal market; (2) whether
fundamental rights and/or the public interest are a strong justification for the exception; and (3)
whether an underlying policy (i.e. economic or innovation policy) is better achieved at EU level.

At the same time Member States should be encouraged to make use of existing flexibilities for
exceptions and limitations, including with respect to the non-harmonised right of adaptation. To
some degree this allows Member States to develop new approaches to maximise the economic,
cultural and societal benefits of exceptions; these approaches in turn inform other Member States
and the EU on how to best adapt to societal and technological changes. This also takes into account
the social, cultural and economic background prevalent in individual Member States.

In the case of the exception for private copying, and given the problems with the levies system
(highlighted further in our responses to Section IV of this consultation), the exception should remain
optional and not be made mandatory. Member States should also have the possibility of
implementing the exception allowing that no further compensation is due to rightholders for the
private copy if they conclude that it does not result in any significant harm.
23, Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Exceptions should not be removed. It is increasingly important that exceptions are interpreted in
order to ensure that they appropriately balance the interests of all stakeholders. This is true, for
example, in relation to efforts to expand the scope of the reproduction right14 or narrow the scope of
relevant exceptions to restrict legitimate and desirable activities, such as browsing and linking.

New exceptions may be necessary – new, unforeseen developments appear regularly in the digital
world. Monitoring of the state of play should help inform evidence-based policy making and
determining whether such new exceptions are necessary. The rise of copy-reliant technologies leads
to innovation, which is by definition unpredictable. Recognition tools such as Shazam, anti-plagiarism
software such as Turn It In, and data analytics, are examples of services which rely on reproducing a
vast number of works. They constitute non-expressive and transformative uses, which do not
unreasonably harm the market for the original work, nor take away any value from those works.
Given than such exceptions do not cause unreasonable prejudice to rightholders, and given our
answers to in section IV, it goes without saying that any new exception would not cause harm nor
require any form of compensation.

However, EU-wide ad hoc exceptions may only be part of the solution, as they take considerable time
to adopt and implement. For instance, it is now 6 years since the Commission concluded that lack of
a UGC exception “can be perceived as a barrier to innovation in that it blocks new, potentially
valuable works from being disseminated” (Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy
(COM(2008) 466/3). This time translates to a lower likelihood of investment, less innovations and a
European competitiveness gap15. One option to address this challenge might be further guidance
from the Commission in relation to the appropriate scope of exceptions.

24, Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
YES – Please explain why
First, it important to highlight that the notion that European countries and courts cannot deal with
flexibility in copyright is a pervasive fiction. National as well as EU copyright rules already contain
several provisions which give rise to interpretation by courts.

Recent CJEU case law has shown that the exact meaning and scope of exception may remain unclear
and requires interpretation16. The CJEU also increasingly examines the proportionality between a
copyright norm and other interests, including fundamental rights protected under the Charter17.
Finally, the 3-steps-test (Art. 5.5 of the Directive 2001/2) already provides a flexible instrument which
is used by national courts as well as the CJEU18.

Second, such flexibility could be used to accommodate innovation, technological advancements and
promote growth within this framework. Industries that rely on exceptions and limitations that
balance copyright laws represent Euro 1.1 trillion, or 9.3 percent of the EU’s GDP. They employed
close to 9 million people and were growing 3 percent faster than the rest of the EU economy19. The
UK government estimates that its copyright reforms will add between 0.3% and 0.6% to the UK

economy by 202020. Innovation in the digital environment increasingly relies on reproductions which
do not conflict with the normal exploitation of copyright works and do not unreasonably prejudice
the interests of rights holders21. The fact that in 2014 the CJEU was asked to decide whether basic
activities such as linking and browsing are, from a copyright perspective, lawful, is perhaps evidence
that aspects of the current framework are not always sufficiently balanced.

Third, while online services contribute to the discoverability, accessibility and monetisation of
creative works through licensing agreements, this does not stand for the proposition that every
digital interaction with a copyrighted work requires a licence. In other terms, licensing is not a
solution to everything. For instance, ideas, facts etc., are not subject to copyright as the burden of
such a monopoly on society would be unbearably costly. Licensing temporary reproductions that
clearly fall within the exception set out in Article 5(1) of the Copyright Directive would re-constitute a
monopoly on facts and ideas. Similarly, many non-consumptive or transformative uses that comply
with the 3-steps-test would not accommodate licensing. Licensing would in such cases allow, for
example, a single copyright owner to potentially block or diminish the value of the innovation (e.g.
‘hold up scenarios’), and to derive rent in a situation where his incentives to create in the first place
are not impacted.

25, If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission,
built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach
as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

The different options available for striking an appropriate and flexible, future-proof balance requires
careful consideration. However, as noted earlier, it is doubtful whether periodic revision of the EU
acquis on an ad hoc basis is able to keep pace with economic and social developments.

It should be emphasised that there are of course already open norms in the EU, such as the 3-steps-
test, or proposals such as Article 5.5. of the ‘Wittem European Copyright Code’22, or the Irish
‘Modernising Copyright’ proposal23.

While an open ended norm at EU level is one possibility, there are others. Member States and
national courts might also be well placed to make use of existing flexibilities, in particular as afforded
under the existing right of adaptation.

We would welcome further discussion on these issues in particular. If Member States are to be
encouraged to introduce flexibility in their interpretation of exceptions, it may be worth reflecting on
how to best articulate these flexibilities with the internal market and European policies.

The Commission may make clear that the harmonisation of rights under the acquis is full
harmonisation, as recently recalled by the Court in Case C-466/12 Svensson, and that the
establishment of new IPR rules at national level can creates new obstacles to the single market and
may circumvent existing exceptions.

B. Teaching
 44, What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for
teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Over the past few years the market has introduced a variety of innovative tools, products and
services that are tailored to promote and push content for educational purposes. Ubiquitous
connectively, the wide variety of accessible new smart devices as well as initiatives such as Open
Educational Resources (OER) and open licensing models (i.e. creative commons) has fed the
development of thousands of educational applications that are available across various platforms.
The number is growing every day and cover text books, language learning tools and access to
massive open online courses (MOOC) for all educational levels.
EDiMA members may provide examples of specific solutions they have implemented in their own
individual responses to the consultation.
45, If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
As stated in previous answers and partly recognised by the Commission in its recent Communication
(COM (2013)), open licensing models, educational initiatives (OER) and the current exception,
provide sufficient flexibility for the market to develop innovative offerings/services. We therefore do
not believe that new legislation is needed at this stage. Additionally, this is a very young market
which the Commission should not be prematurely regulating.

E, Text and data mining
53, (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
YES – Please explain
It is not always clear what text-and-data mining are precisely, meaning that different interpretations
exist. However, under a broad interpretation of the notion, as suggested in the consultation, it
appears that many digital technologies might come under the scope of ‘data mining’. Generally, large
volumes of information combined with increasing computing powers provide a raft of new
opportunities for innovation, growth and competitiveness24.

In particular, new technologies for speech recognition, subtitling, software analytics, etc., rely on
large amounts of data as input, including but not limited to materials found on the Internet. These



24
  See e.g. McKinsey Global Institute's (MGI) report on data driven innovation, The next frontier for innovation,
competition, and productivity (2011),

                                                                                                                   14
technologies underpin the development of applications in life sciences25, humanities26, health care27
and many other markets and applications.28

Depending on how text and data-mining (TDM) are defined or interpreted, it is likely not subject to
copyright protection. Many consider that TDM is the functional equivalent of human researchers
reading and analysing text and data - an activity that has never been an infringement of copyright –
through computer analysis. The results of such TDM are new results which are not reproductions of
the work.

This is consistent with the notion that copyright protection only covers ‘expression’ and not ideas,
procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts29. A monopoly on information or ideas
would be extremely burdensome on society as a whole, as well as being contrary to international
law.

What is surprising is that some groups have suggested that all text and data mining activities should
require a licence (beyond lawful access to content). If this were the case, there would be a significant
problem. In addition, the ubiquitous reproduction right might also eventually put text and data
mining activities under strain and lead to an over-reliance on the exception for transient
reproductions.

54, If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The problem lies in the assertion that text and data mining might infringe copyright. It is important to
establish, clearly and unambiguously, that TDM is not currently in general subject to copyright
protection, and should not be. In particular, facts and ideas cannot be protected by copyright,
whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. Mining is a non-expressive use that presents
no legally cognisable conflict with the statutory rights or interests of the copyright holders.

We would caution against any extension of the scope of copyright in this respect. Should there be
further discussions on this topic, we would also caution against drawing a distinction between
commercial and non-commercial TDM.

E.       User-generated content
58, (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems when trying
to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on the Internet,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter through
your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from the way
the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the
Internet, including across borders?
YES – Please explain by giving examples
Users of online services regularly see content taken down, blocked, or in some cases monetised for
the benefit of the wrong person. While some services operate rights management tools to assist in
identifying re-used content, these cannot fulfil the role of determining whether a particular use
qualifies under an existing exception. This can result in the blocking of content which is lawful and
falls under existing copyright exceptions. Some cases are not always clear: see Lenz v Universal30
(video), or YouTomb, an MIT research project which collects videos wrongly removed from YouTube.
This can also result in the wrongful attribution of ‘ownership’ in the remix. For example, a ‘remix’
,which qualifies as a creative work and which falls under the parody exception, might be treated by a
system as being a re-use requiring permission from the owner of the parodied content. Systems
cannot determine whether a re-use is a parody. As a result, when the owner of the parodied content
chooses to authorise re-use against remuneration, remuneration generated from the parody will be
wrongly attributed to the owner of the parodied content.

The recent ‘Lescure report’ (Rapport de la Mission « Acte II de l’exception culturelle »: Contribution
aux politiques culturelles à l’ère numérique (May 2013), p. 425 et. seq.) in France unambiguously
states that there should be a safe legal framework for all users who create content.

YES
62, If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?
While licensing is an important aspect of UGC, it has limitations. In addition to those pointed out
above, it only caters to major online services - users cannot share content on their own sites for
instance – and it may not be immediately available to new and innovative services.

Exceptions and limitations thus play a useful role in clarifying what users are permitted to do. It is
worth mentioning they are also necessary where refusing a permission for certain uses might be
economically rational, even despite the prospect of remuneration. This is for instance the case for
parodies and criticism of particular work.

It is debatable whether such limitations have a negative impact on the market for the work. A study
for the UK IPO on UGC on YouTube found that there was no evidence for economic damage to
rightholders through substitution and that the presence of parody content is correlated with, and
predicts larger audiences for, original music videos31. The French Lescure Report notes that user
generated parodies and remixes contribute largely to the success of original content32.

Possible solutions include an express limitation for non-commercial ‘remixes’ as introduced in
Canada33; clarifying the scope of existing exceptions and encouraging Member States to implement
them, as suggested by the ‘Mission Lescure’ in relation to the exception for quotations34; or the
introduction of more flexible exceptions for transformative uses.

63, If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The scale of UGC is dramatic in terms of engagement and participation. Across nine EU countries in
2013 (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden), BCG found
that about eight in ten Europeans consumed UGC or participated in a social network during the past
12 months; about three in ten uploaded a video or personal picture online; and nearly two in ten
were editing or managing a blog or website35. In the EU-28, according to Eurostat, close to 23 million
Europeans engaged in creating a website or blog in 2012, including 14% of EU citizens aged between
16 and 24 years old. Over 83 million Europeans uploaded self-created content to a website, including
47% of 16 to 24 year olds. 11% of Europeans posted opinions on civic or political issues via websites.
As for remixes, the Pew Research Center reports that, in the US, 40% of adults who post videos to

online sites post “videos that mix content and material in a creative way”. In 2010, among Internet
users, 21% of teens and 15% of adults reported creating “remixes36.

The production of UGC content shows vitality and diversity: WordPress users produce about 36.3
million new posts and 63.1 million new comments each month. 130 hours of video are uploaded to
YouTube every minute. There are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on
more than 22,000,000 articles in 285 languages. There are 41 000 posts a second on Facebook, 5,700
Tweets a second on Twitter, and 758 million photos a day were uploaded and shared online in
201337.

The value of UGC is also already clear. According to the OECD, UGC “provides citizens, consumers
and students with information and knowledge. Educational UGC tends to be collaborative and
encourages sharing and the joint production of information, ideas, opinions and knowledge. For
example, building on participative web technologies to improve the quality and extend the reach of
education. UGC is an “open platform enriching political and societal debates, diversity of opinion,
free flow of information and freedom of expression [...]”38. UGC also allows citizens to ‘talk back to
culture’. Remixers are fans who engage with culture, not pirates. Finally, “remixes produce valuable
cultural and political commentary. They are particularly attractive to groups underrepresented in [...]
mass culture—women, non-whites, and LGBT individuals, among others—who use remixes as a way
to talk back to that culture, to identify what it is leaving out and explain what they
see”39(Organisation for transformative works). It is also worth noting that ‘re-mixing’ is a seasoned
practice for aspiring greats to hone their talents - from Shakespeare, Milton, La Fontaine (i.e. Aesop)
to Dali (i.e. Da Vinci), Proust (i.e. Flaubert) and rap, creators engage with previous creations, re-use
them, and learn skills.

EDiMA believes that UGC demonstrates how copyright rules that were initially designed with content
created ‘professionally’ in mind should now take into account the present way people experience
creativity every day. The overwhelming majority of content created today is no longer produced by
legacy copyright industries with legacy distribution models in mind.

 IV.         Private copying and reprography


64, In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
copying and reprography exceptions40 in the digital environment?
YES – Please explain
Levies should not be extended further to the digital environment and the goal of EU copyright policy
should be for levies to be phased out. In their April 2011 report, Oxera concluded that removing
copyright levies would make all stakeholders better off and generate additional welfare for the EU
economy of up to €1,880m per year41. Where necessary, alternative forms of fair compensation for

private copying may be considered, although EDiMA believes that the application of levies bears no
relationship to harm suffered by rightholders.

Any initiative in relation to levies should clarify the scope of the levy, for instance in relation to
activities that are out of scope, such as: professional uses, legitimate consumer expectations that
cause no harm to rightsholders, temporary copies, and user generated content – the two last
examples being increasingly relevant in the online environment. UGC clearly demonstrates that
digital technology is overwhelmingly used to create and share content produced by end-users, rather
than content administered by established rightholders. For instance, in the EU-28, according to
Eurostat, close to 23 million Europeans engaged in creating a website or blog in 2012, over 83 million
Europeans uploaded self-created content to a website, including 47% of 16 to 24 year olds42. The
result is a staggering vitality in the production of UGC: e.g. WordPress users produce about 36.3
million new posts and 63.1 million new comments each month; 130 hours of video are uploaded to
YouTube every minute; there are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on
more than 22,000,000 articles in 285 languages; 758 million photos a day were uploaded and shared
online in 2013.

Further reform might consider the need for an exception that creates a ‘safe harbour’ from levy
claims. The scope of any exception for private uses should be sufficiently flexible and future-proof to
adapt to legitimate consumer expectations in the digital environment and to digital innovation. Such
innovation has proven repeatedly that it delivers growth for the creative industries and increased
consumer welfare43. Platform or format shifting (i.e. copying, or rather accessing, the same piece of
legal content from/onto another device of the person) are examples of content usage that
consumers legitimately expect and which do not cause demonstrable harm to rightholders: i.e. they
happen as a matter of course, and most reasonable people assume they are, or should be,
permissible. On the other hand, the exception still has to fit within the 3-step-test so as to not
unreasonably prejudice the interests of rightholders, without the need for additional compensation.
This is the critical balance that has to be struck.

The limit or boundary of the private copying exception should preferably be purposive: contingent on
causing no significant proven harm or unreasonable prejudice to rightholders, in the sense that the
private copy did not result in a lost sale. In such circumstances, the nature (and impact) of private
copying is, and should be considered, immaterial. This would provide an opportunity to clarify that
certain private activities with regard to legally accessed content (such as platform or format shifting
and time shifting, for personal use or within the strict domestic family circle, and other uses which do
not unreasonably prejudice the interests of rightholders) cause no more than minimal harm to the
rightholder and so are outside the scope of any requirement for compensation.

65, Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has
been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?44
NO – Please explain

can more easily engage in new models to distribute music and that rights holders could gain as a more dynamic market could
drive growth in legal music sales and the effective compensation of rights holders.
42 Across 9 EU countries in 2013, BCG finds that about eight in ten Europeans consumed UGC or participated in a social

network during the past 12 months; about three in ten uploaded a video or personal picture online; and nearly two in ten were
editing or managing a blog or website.

The application of levies in the case of licensed services has no legal, economic, or moral justification
and ignores legitimate consumer expectations when they have acquired or accessed authorised
content. A copy made for private purposes from an authorised ‘original’ should not trigger a levy,
otherwise it would result in multiple payments. A license should exhaust any claim to levies. Any
other conclusion would be in contradiction of existing legislation (Article 6(4) of the Copyright
Directive) and inconsistent with existing case law (see. ECJ decision C-467/08 (Padawan vs.SGAE) and
C-462/09 (Stichting vs. Opus)). Simply stated, copies that are made by end users for private purposes
and authorised by the rights holders in the context of a service that has been licensed do not cause
any harm and should therefore not require or be subject to additional compensation in the form of
levies.

Users commonly assume that when they use an online content service they should be able to access
their legally acquired content in various formats and across multiple devices. This is simply the nature
of today’s digital environment, as noted by the Irish Modernising Copyright report45, the UK
Hargreaves Review46 and the Vitorino Report47.

Accordingly, consumers purchase originals under the assumption that they can make copies, and
rightholders know these copies will occur. The fact that the ability to make copies is priced into
distribution to the consumer has been recognised in various studies and is even reflected in UK and
Irish policy in this area48. Put simply, another way of looking at this is that consumers cannot
reasonably be expected to purchase separate originals for their home audio system, their car, their
MP3 player and their computer.

There is no demonstrable harm to rightholders in such cases, e.g. in the form of lost sales, and these
situations should be considered de minimis. Mr. Vitorino came to the same conclusion in his report
on copyright levies where he rightly argued that applying a levy on a licensed service would pave the
way for multiple payments and be incomprehensible to consumers as it would be inconsistent with

45   Modernising Copyright: The Report of the Copyright Review Committee (Dublin, 2013), page 60,
http://www.enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/CRC-Report.pdf: the main argument in favour of private copying exceptions
relates to users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations. Users now commonly assume and expect that, if they buy
content for personal (as opposed to commercial) use, they should be able to access it in various formats and across multiple
devices. As a consequence, many users routinely make copies for private use, and do not believe that this is or should be
against the law”.

http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf: “digital technology has enabled use and reuse of material by private
individuals in ways that they do not feel are wrong – such as sharing music tracks with immediate family members, or
transferring a track from a CD to play in the car”
47 António Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the Mediation on Private Copying and Reprography Levies, page 6:

“A person paying for e.g. the download of a song expects that this payment does not only cover the first download of that
song onto his or her personal computer but also the subsequent copying of that song to a certain number of his or her mobile
devices, as determined by the usage rules of the service provider. Similarly, a person subscribing to a music streaming service
is usually not only paying for the online streaming to his or her device/s but also for the possibility to create "playlists" that
can be listened to when ‘offline’”
48 “Economic theory suggests that the benefits consumers derive from any copyright exceptions will be incorporated

automatically into the demand for the original creative work. Consumers will recognise that buying the original entitles them
to use the product in various ways and hence their demand decision will reflect this”: Mark Rogers, Joshua Tomalin and Ray
Corrigan, ‘The economic impact of consumer copyright exceptions: A literature review’ (2013), page 30; Ian Hagreaves,
Digital Opportunity, ‘A Review of IP and Growth’, section 5.30: “As right holders are well aware of consumers’ behaviour in
this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able to do this is already factored into the price that right holders are
charging. A limited private copying exception which corresponds to the expectations of buyers and sellers of copyright
content, and is therefore already priced into the purchase, will by definition not entail a loss for right holders”; Martin
Kretschmer, ‘Private Copying and Fair Compensation’ (2011) page 68: “a certain amount of copying can already be priced
into the retail sale of the first copy if the consumer understands these benefits”; H.A.Varian (2005), ‘Copying and Copyright’,

Committee’ (Dublin, 2013), page 60.

users’ reasonable assumptions and basic expectations. However, unfortunately it must be noted
that, in practice, consumers are currently in some instances already being subject to such multiple
payments.

It is also worth noting that, largely due to the different collection, administration and distribution
rules applicable to compensation for private copying, EDiMA members have experienced difficulties
in requesting licences for end-user uses of content. This is most likely to be the case with collecting
societies which act both as licensors and administrators of compensation. These difficulties are a
hindrance to the launch of new services as well as to their cross-border availability. EDiMA stresses
that service providers should always have a choice between the application of the exception and
licensing, to the effect that licensing should exhaust any economic claim to compensation that would
have arisen under the exception.

66, How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services
based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact
the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’
revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Levy systems are not fit for purpose in the digital environment and hinder the establishment of a
digital single market within the EU. Levy systems deter the EU from attracting and promoting digital
innovation in today’s global market, and as such, if applied to the cloud in any way, would only
decelerate the development of promising and increasingly popular new services such as those
enabled via cloud computing. At a time when legal offerings are increasingly prevalent and
consumers seek to enjoy access anytime, anywhere, as well as produce their own content, the notion
that certain private acts of ‘copying’ trigger a levy is obsolete. The issues listed below are only a non-
exhaustive overview of the negative impact that extending levies would generate.

Deterring investments in new online services and slowing revenue growth for creative industries:
Today, creative industries partner with digital services to develop new, attractive online offerings of
creative content to consumers. Such services require significant investment, risk taking and
commercial discussions. Should levies be extended, this would act as a deterrent to commercial
licensing and the development of new services. Indeed, it seems the bizarre consequence of such a
system would be that the more licensors and service providers jointly work to develop new online
services, increase revenues and reduce piracy, the more levies would be claimed. It would also
hamper the growth of such services due to various levy claims applied indiscriminately in different
services.

It is worth noting that this would lead to lost revenues for rightholders too. As noted by the OECD,
cloud offerings bring more value to consumers and enable a greater reach to broader audiences.
Rightholders benefit from this increased value through licensing as well as the opportunity to
distribute directly to consumers, with reduced distribution costs49. In their April 2011 study50 Oxera
calculates that rights holder remuneration could increase by up to €626 million per annum in the EU,
should levies be removed.

Hampering economic growth and innovation: Cloud computing is expected to create 400 000 new
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union, to add nearly 1000 billion euros
to EU GDP between 2015-2020 (contributing 1% to 4% to growth) and create up to a million jobs in
the EU51. For businesses, cloud services generate considerable savings and productivity gains. For
consumers, cloud services deliver a host of useful day-to-day applications delivered over the cloud,
as well as new opportunities to share and store personal content and new ways to consume creative
content anytime, anywhere. These include email, calendars, word processing and other productivity
and collaborative tools; photo sharing and editing tools, online games, cloud lockers, etc.

It has already been noted that levies have adverse consequences on growth52. Levies have significant
adverse impacts on the development of the economy and the digital economy in particular53.
Innovation and opportunity costs are, by definition, difficult to predict, but there is a growing body of
evidence correlating copyright and innovation policy54. Harvard professor Josh Lerner recently
evaluated that legal uncertainty on cloud services lead to a reduction in VC investment in the cloud
of $4.6m and $2.8m respectively per quarter in France and Germany55. In the UK, the government
estimates that reforming copyright, including a reform of private copying, will be “adding between
0.3% and 0.6% to the size of the UK economy by 2020 – between £5 billion and £8 billion [€5.72
billion and €9.15 billion] – and cutting deadweight costs in the economy by over £750 million [€858
million]”56. In relation to levies, the UK IPO estimates that economic benefits to GBP 258.67 million57.

Segmenting the single market: It is also clear that levies are not efficient, imply a significant
administrative burden and the fragmentation of markets along national borders. Any European
company seeking to innovate in the area of cloud services would be stifled by the cost and burden of
liability for levy payments, including the burden of additional administrative overheads58, in
particular in relation to its non-EU counterparts. The cloud and Internet services are global. Levies
are applied by national collecting societies on a strictly territorial basis and are triggered when a
good crosses a border. Each time this occurs, levies can add up, bringing multiple payments,
administrative costs and associated procedures. This is fundamentally at odds with the vision of the
EU single market and the global nature of cloud services. Charging levies, i.e. a duty charged to
consumers, on cloud services will undermine the digital single market in cloud services before its
opportunities have even materialised. Yet, a single market in digital services is key to driving cloud
services forward in the EU. Only a digital single market can attract investment in early stage offerings
from EU innovators.

Ignoring legitimate consumer expectations, increasing consumer prices, and taxing user creativity:
consumers legitimately expect that they can make private copies of content that they acquire.

   Levy payments often require companies to set up dedicated accounting methodologies that bear little or no
resemblance to the data compilation and accounting needed for their normal commercial business, giving rise to
a significant additional administrative overhead.

                                                                                                                            22
Imposing new payments for their use of cloud type services would ignore their expectations, penalise
them for acquiring lawful content, and directly increase the costs to consumers of accessing cloud
services, placing them at a disadvantage compared with their peers across the rest of the world.
Furthermore, imposing rules devised for an age of analogue devices, physical media, and content
exclusively produced for commercial distribution ignores the fact that the vast majority of content in
the cloud is professional or created by users, i.e. user-generated content (UGC). Content such as
emails, work documents or holiday photographs belongs to users and does not need to be licensed
or paid for. It is not content produced with a view to commercially asserting copyright.
The notion that digital services and technologies are dependent on professional content for
consumer utility can no longer be substantiated. The overwhelming majority of content produced
and shared on the Internet, on digital services and using connected devices does not belong to
rightholder organisations. These activities are clearly excluded from the scope of private copying
levies. Yet the bluntness of levies would catch all this content and mandate intrusive and highly
misguided levies on personal content to the detriment of nearly all citizens.

EDiMA believes the best way to generate more revenues for creators, enhance consumer welfare
and encourage growth is to encourage the development innovation and legal offers in Europe, not
more levies. The digital economy is a major driver for growth in the EU and is expected to grow
seven times faster than overall EU GDP in the coming years59. By 2016, the Internet economy of the
G-20 is predicted to reach an aggregate value of $4.2 trillion60. EDiMA therefore fully supports the
orientation given by the Commission at the initiative of President Barroso: “Exploiting the full
potential of the digital economy is vital to delivering growth in Europe. It is extremely important for
us to work with industry in order to accelerate solutions which tap the potential of digital markets to
develop new business models. A modern copyright framework can be win-win for all stakeholders,
providing sustainable incentives for creativity, cultural diversity and innovation, and improving choice
and access to legal offers for consumers61". Several governments, such as the UK and Ireland, have
rejected levies, which they characterise as a blunt instrument and a burden on innovation. EDiMA
emphasises that levies in relation to online service would significantly undermine the potential for
growth of the digital economy and, in particular, European competitiveness and innovation.

67, Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to
levies?62
YES – Please explain
Consumers generally do not know they are paying a private copy levy on digital equipment they
purchase, nor how much it is, or what it is for - or that the amount they pay varies significantly from
country to country. At the very least, the amount of the levy should be made visible to consumers at
the point of sale and such transparency should be encouraged at EU level.
68, Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of
goods or services?

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue payments.
Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes could help to
remedy the situation.
Our experience is that, in cross-border sales, national collecting societies charge copy levies twice:
once in the country where a product is brought into circulation for the first time in the EU (first
wholesale purchase, the “country of origin”), and again when the item is sold to an end-customer
located in a different country (the “country of destination”). In practice, this leads to double
payments by the retailer: collecting societies and the ECJ refer to reimbursement schemes and ask
the retailer to seek a refund of levies paid in the country of origin; however, a majority of Member
States do not have reimbursement schemes in place. Where they do exist, they are often not
publicised or widely known, are difficult to access, often ineffective, and ultimately put the burden of
reporting sales and risk of loss on the requesting retailer. Very few, if any, of the reimbursement
schemes meet the standard of being “effective” and “not excessively difficult”, as set forth by the ECJ
in its judgment in Case C-521/11 Austro Mechana.

If, for example, an end customer purchases a blank DVD from an online retailer who physically stores
its stock in Germany and wants it delivered into Belgium, the German collecting society will have
charged a levy on the blank DVD when it was first brought into circulation in Germany and the
vendor will have passed this levy onto the retailer in its wholesale price. Subsequently, the Belgian
collecting society will charge the retailer a levy on that same blank DVD, since it is being sold to an
end customer in Belgium. National collecting societies are therefore charging copy levies on items
both upon importation into their territory and – in case of cross-border sales – upon retail sale within
their territory. This results in undue double payments amounting to millions of euros in hypothetical
setoff rights that could be claimed from collecting societies that unduly charge copy levies and that
are required by the ECJ to offer a refund.

Beyond imposing heavy administrative burdens on cross-border traders for reporting and paying the
levies, this situation creates a complex and unpredictable environment for businesses, and leads to a
reluctance of traders to sell across internal EU borders because of the costs attached to paying
copyright levies, thereby hindering the pan-European online retail single market. This situation
induces manufacturers to avoid or minimise levy payments and, therefore, to withdraw specific types
of devices from a national market, or to downgrade the specifications of a device (by adopting
smaller inbuilt memories, for example) to the detriment of end-customers. Consumers are penalised
by a limited choice of products and technologies. The system’s failure to take into account the
specificities of the online retail business model undermines cross-border trade and the single market
itself, in view of the fact that online retailers are those at the forefront of driving cross-border offers.

The fact that levies may be charged both at the country of origin and at the country of destination
renders the exercise of an EU Fundamental Freedom less attractive, since cross-border retailers are
the only ones to actually suffer from double payment, and will only belatedly be able to file claims for
reimbursement at origin ex post, as and if reimbursement schemes become widely available under
national regulations. In any given period of time, therefore, cross-border retailers will have to accept
the burden of paying two identical levies on the same products while waiting for a reimbursement to
be processed at the country of origin.

Strictly national retailers, on the other hand, will have only paid once all along and will be at a
considerable competitive advantage, seeing as copy levies may be well over 15% of an item’s retail
price. This is precisely the definition of a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative
restriction on imports, strictly forbidden under Article 34 of the TFEU. We believe no mandatory

                                                                                                         24
requirement (whether the protection or the promotion of culture, or the protection of legitimate IP
rights) could justify a system that results in paying the same levies twice and doubling non-national
retailers’ costs and risks in comparison to national retailers, since the ultimate purpose of copy levies
is to correctly compensate copyright holders for acts of private copying of their works by individuals
– something that has no bearing whatsoever on the shipment of a product from one Member State
to another.

71, If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how
would these problems best be solved?

The EU should chart a path towards the phasing out of levies across Europe. Where demonstrable
harm exists, alternative forms of fair compensation for the harm caused by private copying should be
explored with Member Sates deciding whatever alternative compensation mechanism they wish to
implement (to the extent compensation is legally due based on non-minimal harm to
rightholders).Examples of alternative compensation mechanisms currently implemented in Member
States include: state budget (Spain), priced into purchase (UK, Ireland), and public lottery (the UK’s
national lottery funds cultural events).

EDiMA would also like to highlight some problematic aspects of levies which deserve more attention.

1. The current levy system in Europe is in practice divorced from any assessment of harm. Instead, is
applied in an arbitrary manner, divorced from any substantiated economic data and as a result
difficult to square predictability and the rule of law. This is clearly illustrated by massive divergence
of tariffs across Europe and the significant increase in claims. For example the difference in tariff on a
single device across the EU can vary anywhere between 1% - 10% of the purchase price, as
documented by WIPO’s International survey on private copying63. Across the single market, levies
collected per capita vary immensely are for instance over one hundred times higher in France than in
Romania64. A recent attempt in Italy envisaged a tariff increase of up 500% on a single product.
Similarly, in France, in 2008, the Conseil d’Etat invalidated the tariffs set by the private copy
commission for including illegal materials in calculation of the levy65. But subsequently, the private
copy commission set exactly the same tariffs as the one cancelled by the Council of States, arguing
opportunistically that compression rates have changed, justifying an increase.

Even allowing for some differences between consumer behaviours in different Member States, it
seems difficult to reconcile these examples with a legally and economically sound application of
levies. Indeed academic literature on levies acknowledges this arbitrariness, as expressed by Prof.
Towse: “the copyright levy […] has been almost universally opposed by economists on the grounds
that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to the market value of the works and
therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators”66.

Similarly, “In our investigations into the levy systems in other countries, we contacted experts in intellectual
property law including Rufus Pollock (UK), Kimberlee Weatherall (Australia) and Jeremy de Beer (Canada).
They were able to provide us some useful information into the levy regimes in their countries, but also confirmed

                                                                                                              25
Following the argument of Mr. Vitorino and confirmed by the ECJ Padawan ruling, the determination
of harm must been looked at and “measuring all the copies actually made by virtue of the exception
without taking into account the consumers' willingness to pay for these copies” will result in higher
compensation than what the law requires. Which is currently the case. UK and Ireland have shown
that without the exception, rights-holders have not experienced any economic harm. On the
contrary, the UK market is one the most developed markets of content in the world.

2. EDiMA would like to highlight an aspect of levies which is often overlooked. The differing
approaches to the issue cannot be fully understood without an understanding of how revenues are
collected, administered and distributed. For instance, licensing revenue for online rights often flows
through a commercial licensor such as a record company or a publisher, which is not a collecting
society. On the other hand, private copying levies are invariably collected and administered by a
collecting society. Such collecting societies in turn apply their internal distribution rules and, where
applicable, cultural and social deductions.

Against this backdrop, the growth of digital revenue generates tensions between the different actors
in the creative sector as to whom collects, manages and administers these new revenue streams.
This may lead rightholders to claim that revenues generated are insufficient, when in reality the
question is how this new revenue is collected and distributed, and by whom. For instance, it is often
alleged that artist revenues would collapse but for levies. But in practice, collectively managed
income is not the only source of income for creators or artists; numerous other more substantial
sources exist including e.g. contractual revenues.

Accordingly, it is important to point out that digital players who contract with and remunerate many
rightholders to increase the growth of digital revenue are simultaneously impacted and involved in
discussions regarding the creative and public sectors. EDiMA believes informed and evidence-based
policy making is essential to a constructive discussion on private copying levies. A useful first step
would be to collect hard evidence on the claims that creators are not benefiting from revenues.

3. As noted above, the collection of levies by collecting societies in some countries also contributes
to culture funds. These are worthy endeavours in their own right. However, it must take into account
that the entities that grant licences, collect and administer private copying levies and administer
cultural funds are in practice often one and same, leading to unforeseen and perhaps undesirable
consequences. For instance, income for which no rightholder has been identified might be allocated
to culture funds; or a society may prefer collecting levies to granting a licence; or the amount of
levies requested might be in part determined by other factors than the existence of any proven harm
to rightholders.

4. EDiMA believes the best way for copyright policy to promote cultural diversity is to allow digital
services to flourish and creators to be rewarded through the exercise of their intellectual property
rights. The problem is that the blunt application of levies clearly threatens to undermine the digital
growth of the creative sector: efforts to develop new, attractive legal offers are met with calls for the
payment of more compensation. This acts as a simple, effective deterrent to the development of new
services in the EU.

EDiMA stresses the benefits that online offerings are yielding for cultural diversity. A broader
diversity of creative content is being produced in Europe than ever before. The number of books
published in Europe has grown by close to 80% between 1995 and 201167. The annual release of new
music albums has increased significantly since 2000, the share of independently produced records
has grown and the number of artists achieving commercial success has also increased68. Between
2005 and 2009, the number of films produced in a year in Europe rose from 890 to just under 1150 69.
Revenues are also growing. From 2001 to 2011, all growth in the creative sector was generated by
digital (30bn Euros)70. In the music sector, according to PwC (2012), global spending on digital music
will surpass psychical distribution in 2015, as is already the case for the UK, the US, Sweden and
South Korea71. iTunes reached the milestone of 25 billion songs sold in 2012. Deezer has 30 million
users, including 4 million paying subscribers and Spotify over 24 million active users and 6 million
paying subscribers. Contrary to some views, the Internet has not diminished the appetite for paid
content, and new online services are reducing piracy72. Between 2001 and 2011, consumer spending
on creative content in Europe rose by 25%73.

The current levy systems acts as a hindrance to the development of these opportunities. They hinder
innovation, creators and EU citizens alike, and have become an obstacle to the role of copyright in
funding and supporting creators. In particular, alternative and transparent models must also be
explored and found for funding for national cultural purposes.

      VI.    Respect for rights
75, Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of
copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
NO – Please explain
Action taken must always be proportionate, and our experience is that a “one size fits all” approach
does not offer sufficient flexibility. A variety of factors should influence the severity of the
appropriate measure, including prior violations, the number of complaints, and the nature of the
infringement. It is also important to note that it is often impossible for any individual stakeholder to
take decisive action alone; a cooperative approach is generally far more fruitful. Therefore, a multi-
stakeholder dialogue with the objective of developing voluntary measures directly targeted at
reducing the demand for, and supply of, infringing content (e.g. through increased public education

about the negative impact of infringements, increased action at the source of infringement, or
measures to cut off the revenue streams of infringers) would be a more effective and proportionate,
way to tackle commercial scale infringements.

76, In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers,
domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial
purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

In assessing the role of online intermediaries in IP enforcement, we believe it is essential to strike the
right balance between, on the one hand, protecting intellectual property, and, on the other, not
placing unreasonable expectations on online intermediaries.

The IPR Enforcement Directive and the e-Commerce Directive together achieve this balance: the IPR
Enforcement Directive (and corresponding provisions in the InfoSoc Directive) provides for
injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR
infringement, and lays down the minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national
courts when formulating injunctive measures; and the e-Commerce Directive ensures that such
injunctions cannot result in general monitoring obligations. Moreover, the Copyright Directive lacks
the necessary checks and balances, which are provided for the IPR enforcement in the existing legal
framework.

In light of this, we believe that additional legislation for the enforcement of copyright is not
warranted at this point. However, we would welcome clear guidance from the European Commission
to EU Member States to ensure the correct implementation of the existing legal framework. It is
particularly in the application by national courts that we see a need for guidance on the
circumstances in which injunctions against Internet intermediaries are appropriate and how the
scope of such injunctions must be cabined.

In the past three years, the European Court of Justice has explicitly dealt with the possible scope of
injunctions against Internet intermediaries (e.g. C-324/09 - L’Oreal./.eBay; C-70/10 - Scarlet
Extended, C-360/Sabam/Netlog) and made clear that such injunctions need to be very specific with
regards to the measures to be taken by intermediaries and must not merely be success-oriented. For
example, general filtering systems installed for the prevention of copyright infringements were held
disproportionate. However, such decisions and clarifications have not been taken into account by
some of the EU Member States’ highest national courts. For example, the German Supreme Court
upheld and even tightened its case law against Internet intermediaries based on the assumption that
general and success-oriented injunctions are legitimate together with the setup of general filtering
systems and a general duty to manually compare pictures by the intermediary for the prevention of
copyright infringements (BGH – Judgment dated 16 May 2013 - Kinderhochstühle im Internet II – I ZR
216/11; BGH, Judgment dated 17 August 2011 - I ZR 57/09 - Stiftparfüm).

In any revision of copyright enforcement measures, we urge the Commission to introduce
clarifications to ensure that the scope is adapted to the technical and commercial realities in which
intermediaries operate, and to take into account the interests of businesses and consumers who rely
on the services of intermediaries. In particular, it is important for national courts to understand that
injunctions must be narrowly defined and should only play a very limited role in the fight against
copyright infringements online. Any approach to policymaking in this area must recognise that the
most effective way to deal with copyright infringements is through cooperation between all
stakeholders.

                                                                                                       28
In the context of online infringements specifically, instead of a long and complex legislative process
or fast track proceedings without adequate legal safeguards, the focus should be on self-regulatory
mechanisms. A multi-stakeholder dialogue with the objective of developing voluntary measures
directly targeted at reducing the demand for, and supply of, infringing content (e.g. through
increased public education about the negative impact of infringements, increased action at the
source of infringement, or measures to cut off the revenue streams of infringers) would be more
effective and proportionate, without prejudice to fundamental rights.

Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases of copyright infringements should be sufficiently
accessible to parties affected by an infringement. As an example, self-regulation is an existing
alternative dispute resolution mechanism based on real market needs. There are different ways to
self-regulate but can be categorised in two broad groups: (1) self-regulation designed “by the
industry for the industry” outside the framework of an existing legislation; (2) self-regulation used to
clarify or complete or further detail an existing legislation (see the attached document for example).

Self-regulatory mechanisms as such can more effectively address new or rapidly evolving, and often
time sensitive, subject matters. These measures would also increase rights holders to invest better
because it would ensure that their disputes will be swiftly resolved.

Notification as a type of self-regulation is useful in cases where the implementation of the Directive
differs from one Member State to another. As indicated by the Commission Staff Working Document,
(SEC (2010) 1589 final p.15) in the area of the sale of counterfeit goods over the Internet, in many
cases, intermediaries have adopted comprehensive policies on the protection of copyright which are
clearly spelled out on their sites. These policies include sanctions for users that breach the rules, in
particular for the repeat infringers, comprehensive notice and take-down processes and other tools
that allow a timely elimination of illegal offers, the sharing of information with right holders and
reimbursement schemes for consumers who unintentionally bought counterfeit goods on their site.
In addition, the Working Document states that measures have been applied without affecting the
liability status of the intermediary and have significantly contributed towards the elimination of
counterfeiting on the Internet.

Drawbacks of fast track proceedings could be the lack of appropriate assessments as well as the lack
of adequate legal safeguards during the proceedings. Fast track procedures would allow only “limited
discovery”, which is the process of investigating a claim through depositions, written interrogatories
and requests for production of documents. It can lead to the parties’ presenting the dispute without
fully knowing the underlying facts in the case. The inability to analyse the information can sometimes
work to the resistant detriment.

Because of the nature of the small claims procedures and the need to preserve the balance between
costs and damages, it is possible that the small claims may not be suitable for resolving all types of IP
disputes particularly in the online environment. Indeed, such procedures foresee that a judge may
deal with a claim without a hearing i.e. ‘on paper’. It is likely that patent disputes and some
registered design issues, in particular given their complexity, may not sit well within a small claims
procedure, although even in those fields a small claims procedure may be suitable if all the parties
are SMEs or the case is entirely ‘national’ in character, for example, and the value of the case is
within certain bounds. Article 14 of the Directive 2000/31/EC on e-Commerce already ensures that
Member States can establish procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to information,
while exempting intermediary from the liability for the information stored at the request of a
recipient of the service. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to review the Regulation (EC) No

                                                                                                      29
861/2007 in order to broaden its scope to cover only specific property rights. As mentioned above, if
the Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 is revised, it could offer a better legal basis than the Directive
2004/48/EC. In this case the review of the letter on the basis of small claim procedures would only
mean duplication of legislation

The EU’s intermediary liability regime, as designed by the E-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, is the
cornerstone of online business in Europe, as it has brought economic growth and benefits by
facilitating innovation. In a recent Report on the Economic Impact of the current online intermediary
liability regime in the e-Commerce Directive, Copenhagen Economics concluded that in 2012, online
platforms - such as ecommerce and video-sharing sites, search engines, social networks and cloud
computing providers - contributed more than €430 billion to the European economy in 2012, up from
€310bn in 2009.

The report outlines how online platforms participating in Europe's Single Market benefit the EU
economy in three distinct ways:
    Direct GDP contribution. In 2012, online platforms contributed more than €220 billion
       directly to EU 27 GDP. This contribution has increased by €60 billion since 2009.
    Long term indirect GDP contribution. In 2012, online platforms contributed €210 billion to
       the European economy due to the productivity impact of intermediary platforms on other
       companies, up from €150 billion in 2009.

Economic impact beyond GDP. In 2012, online platforms contributed an additional €640 billion of
value via business-to-business platform revenues, online advertising and the consumer benefit
derived from the use of free services.

77, Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?

Identification of infringers has to be in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The ECJ has ruled in line with Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31, prohibiting national authorities from
adopting measures that would require an ISP to carry out general monitoring of the information that
it transmits on its network (Case C-70/10, Scarlet Extended SA v SABAM paragraph 35, C-360/10,
(SABAM) v Netlog NV, paragraph 33). Furthermore, the ECJ ruled that although the protection of the
right to IP is enshrined in Article 17(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
nothing suggests that it’s inviolable and should absolutely be protected (Case C-70/10, Scarlet
Extended SA v SABAM paragraph 43). According to the court a balance between protection of
fundamental right to property and protection of other fundamental rights should be ensured (Case C-
275/06 Promusicae [2008] ECR I-271, paragraphs 62-68). Moreover, the Court clarified in its
judgment that national authorities and courts must, in particular, strike fair balance between the
protection of IPR enjoyed by copyright holders and that of the freedom to conduct a business
enjoyed by operators, e.g.: ISPs (Case C-70/10, Scarlet Extended, paragraph 46).

In addition, IP addresses are considered as personal and sensitive data in several Member States
according to the ‘Study on online copyright enforcement and Data protection in Selected Member
States, November 2009 (p.4)’ conducted in six countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain,
and Sweden). ISPs therefore cannot store IP addresses for the specific purpose of online copyright
enforcement (with the exception of France). Other means can be used to identify infringements such
as, for instance, test purchases by the rights owners.


                                                                                                     30
Notification mechanism can be a useful tool to inform the infringer. However, this mechanism should
not end with sanctions that are not in line with Article 3 of the Directive 2004/48/EC. They should
stay proportionate without jeopardising fundamental rights of citizens and stay in line with the
judgment of ECJ in Case C-275/06 Promusicae [2008] ECR I-271 paragraphs 62-68, making it clear
that the protection of the fundamental right to property, which includes the rights linked to IP, must
be balanced against the protection of other fundamental rights.

              VII.        A single EU Copyright Title

78, Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as
a single framework for enforcement?
NO OPINION
EDiMA recognises that the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title could be a significant step
forward for the Single Market, with potential benefits for consumers and businesses. However, we
believe that this should only be viewed as a potential long-term objective whereas there are many
pressing issues that need attention in the short/medium term.

  VIII.    Other issues

80, Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please
explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

In making, or even contemplating, any changes to the EU legal framework in the area of copyright
and neighbouring rights it is imperative not to disturb the current delicate balance enshrined in the
existing legal and policy framework impacting particularly, for example, (a) intermediary liability in
the online world, (b) software copyright and applicable exceptions in the software domain, and (c)
data storage business models, e.g. the cloud.
