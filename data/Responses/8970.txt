     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

Music publishers are granting multi-territorial licenses on a daily basis and for many
thousands of products every year. As a way of example, iTunes, YouTube, Spotify & Amazon
are all licensed on a multi territory basis. Licenses for online commercials are, by nature,
usually worldwide. Most TV and film licenses cover several European territories. Licenses for
download, streaming or other digital services are offered on a pan-European basis. It should
be noted, however, that in most cases users do not want to license multiple territories as their
marketing campaigns or digital services are only targeted at one or a few territories.
4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
First and foremost, AEDEM as the rest of AEDEM members (it’s international federation),
would like to emphasise that the existing copyright framework has, and, continues to enable
the development of numerous licensing models at a European level. AEDEM does not
therefore accept that the problems identified by the Commission (territoriality of rights;
difficulties clearing rights in different territories; and contractual clauses in licensing
agreements) create difficulties in accessing online content services.
During the Licenses for Europe (LfE) dialogue, music rightsholders were able to demonstrate
that under the current EU legal framework and under the current market circumstances, digital
music services have developed greatly in the last few years and that the market continues to
grow16. We were also able to prove that, contrary to some views, national repertoire from all
EU Member States is widely and legally available throughout the EU. It is simply not true that
there are significant problems with cross border portability of content and that consumers face
considerable problems when trying to access services purchased from one EU Member State
to the other. The presentations in LfE WG1 showed that portability is provided by online
services when travelling or residing abroad, including downloading MP3 on any device,
synchronising through cloud storage and streaming. We also proved that access to playlists of
services abroad is possible. When limitations exist to cross-border services, they are the result
of each service’s operational needs and intention to meet consumer demand by adapting to
local markets. However, consumer demand for cross border access is nevertheless met
because the main music services which are available in every country have all international
and local repertoires.
As far as copyright clearance is concerned, we believe that the adoption of the EU Directive
on Collective Rights Management will help foster a single European digital market for music
allowing for the competing licensing platforms to continue to develop and aggregate further
repertoire. It would be premature to jump to conclusions before this Directive is adopted and
implemented at national level, and specific measures are undertaken by collective
management organisations (CMOs) to comply with the Directive. In relation to the issue of
the acquisition of rights, participants of the music sector in LfE presented licensing solutions
to continue to streamline multi-territorial licensing through industry led initiatives. For
example, the Armonia project was presented as a current functioning innovative solution and
GRD was presented as a key business tool to provide the necessary data ownership
information to support the administration of licences for the use of musical works. Record
producers presented a licensing scheme for multi-territorial Internet transmission of radio

  Report from LfE WG1 Music: In 2013: 260 + music services in Europe; Over 30 million tracks available in
every EU country; iTunes, Deezer, 7 Digital, YouTube, Myspace available in all EU countries; Spotify in 18
countries, Google Play (10), Rara (20), eMusic (25) – and they are planning to expand; New players such as
Google, Amazon, Juke, Xbox Music emerging; National repertoire in all languages from across the EU is widely
available in every EU country

                                                                                                          9
programmes. It is to be noted that all of these initiatives were considered useful by users
during the LfE discussions17.
Furthermore, we do not consider territoriality of copyright as an obstacle to accessing content.
The territorial nature of copyright has been recognised for centuries, including by the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU)18 and it neither encourages nor impedes cross border
trade, nor is it an obstacle to the Single Market. As mentioned above, our members are
already licensing multi-territorially. The territorial application of copyright does not preclude
EU-wide or cross-border licensing models. Whatever perceived restrictions there may be to
the access of content cross border are always the result of a commercial decision to engage in
single or multi-territorial licensing. This decision is made on the basis of informed choices by
users with due consideration for local demand (cultural preferences, language, etc.). AEDEM
would ask for caution before blaming territorial rights, licensing and the rights clearance
activity as potential obstacles to cross border e-commerce.
In our view, there are other factors unrelated to the difficulties outlined by the Commission
that pose challenges to the cross border availability of content services in the Single Market.
These factors are:
Piracy: It is one of the most important factors hindering the development of the market. We
therefore look forward to the forthcoming initiative aimed at the revision of the Civil
Enforcement Directive, and call upon the Commission to introduce effective measures to
counteract illegal access to copyright protected works, including enforcement and cooperation
with intermediaries (revision of Article 8.3 of the EU Copyright Directive, Article 11 of the
Enforcement Directive and Articles 12 to 15 of the E-Commerce Directive).
Cultural and linguistic differences: Although it could be considered an obstacle, such
differences are what make Europe truly culturally diverse, a characteristic that we all should
cherish. The EU Single Market is not “single”, but rather a compilation of diverse individual
markets where local repertoire is still crucially important.
Other obstacles are a non-harmonised system of taxation and accounting standards, the lack of
a reduced VAT for the delivery of online cultural products, the slow developments in the
areas of micro-payments, digital signatures, etc. These have also been recognised by the
Commission as standing in the way of the completion of the Single Market.
To conclude, the aim of policy makers should be to improve cooperation between European
institutions and all stakeholders in the value chain to ensure a successful digital single market
for the benefit of all (rightsholders, users and European consumers). Any changes to the
current legal framework need to be based on solid economic evidence that possible solutions
via licensing are not working.
5.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
     NO
We do not impose territorial restrictions.

As explained in questions 3 and 4 above, when limitations exist to cross-border services, they
are the result of each service’s operational needs and intention to meet consumer demand by
adapting to local markets. The reasons for this vary; testing business models, infrastructure
costs, establishing relationships with local ISPs and advertisers, the need for a local presence
to provide targeted content, etc. One perfect example of this is the difference between Deezer
and Spotify. While these two services are almost identical, the former chose to launch in all
the EU Member States at the same time while the latter is launching in different territories at
different times. The result is that Spotify is much more successful than Deezer. This proves
how the choice of a service to launch in a specific territory is based on different factors other
than the difficulty in clearing rights (Spotify had cleared all the necessary rights one year and
a half before it actually launched in Italy in February 2013). Services need to take time to
establish a relationship with local partners, (sometimes this takes longer than expected due to
the local monopolies of certain ISPs, for example), carry out market studies of consumer
behaviour, etc.
As rightsholders we do not impose territorial restrictions – we respond to the demands of the
online service providers. Of course we can only license for the territories we represent but we
do not in these cases restrict the service provider from obtaining the rights from the
appropriate rightsholder. In some exceptional, cases music publishers may limit the territory
by license. This is the case for commercial syncs when payment is closely related to the size
of the market being addressed and the advertiser wishes to target its campaign to a curtained
defined territory. By limiting the territory, music publishers are able to offer the use of the
requested song at a lower rate than if we were required to offer the use to all the EEA. This is
because a song may have a separate commercial value, perhaps to a competing producer, in
the remaining territories. Print music is sometimes licensed by territory.
In light of this, these possible restrictions have nothing to do with copyright law.
In addition to the above, there is no legal reason to restrict the ability of a rightsholder to
control the exploitation of his work and to limit it geographically. Indeed, the Coditel I and II
Cases were clear when stated that “the rules of the Treaty cannot in principle constitute an
obstacle to the geographical limits which the parties to a contract of assignment have agreed
upon in order to protect the author and his assigns in this regard19.” Furthermore, “a contract
whereby the owner of the copyright in a film grants an exclusive right to exhibit that film for
a specific period in the territory of a Member State is not, as such, subject to the prohibition
contained in Article 85 of the Treaty20”. Later in 2011, in the Premier League case, the CJEU
confirmed this when it didn’t condemn the Premier League’s practice of territorial licensing

achieved).

why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
 question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.    Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
     NO
Further to our responses above, we believe that the existing EU copyright framework has been
enabling the development of numerous licensing models at European level.
Nonetheless, the situation could improve. The most important measure that is needed to
increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market is inextricably
linked to the protection of rightsholders. In order for the Digital Single Market to fully
develop, urgent measures in relation to piracy are needed. It is the most important factor
hindering the development of the market. Strong measures of enforcement of copyright
throughout Europe are lacking. We therefore call upon the Commission to come up with
initiatives that enable the creation of a level playing field and provide incentives for legitimate
players to enter the online distribution. Increased cooperation from intermediaries and
ensuring that adequate remedies to address illegal websites are available for rightsholders is
crucial in this regard. Rightsholders are doing their part and are busy developing new business
models to meet consumer demand in the digital era. However, these efforts must go hand in
hand with effective legislative initiatives. In this regard, we look forward to the Commission
initiatives in Civil Enforcement, Notice and Action and the revision of the Enforcement
Directive.
In addition, we call upon the Commission to harmonise the discrepancies in fiscal policy
among Member States, particularly in the field of VAT, as they are an obstacle. The
introduction of a reduced VAT for the delivery of online cultural products would provide a
major consumer boost for the development of the Digital Single Market. We also look
forward to developments in the field of micro-payments, digital signatures, diverging
advertising standards or restrictions, etc.
Finally, we would like to point out a market and industry led initiative that, once in place, will
be an instrument to facilitate licensing: the Global Repertoire Database (see question 19
below).

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC21 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this

21
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                        12
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software22 and databases23.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders24 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies25, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks26. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public27. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
25
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
26
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
27
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                               13
AEDEM considers that this concept is sufficiently clear and that no additional measures need
to be introduced.
We believe that multi-territorial licensing should remain based on a market driven approach
reliant on contractual freedom and protected by robust enforcement measures in order to meet
consumer demand and maintain both the value of the content being delivered and the
incentives to further invest in different types of content. National (and even local) cultures,
languages and tastes require specific offers. One size fits all doesn’t work in the EU and
AEDEM judges it is a good thing that it doesn’t work as it is a sign of a culturally diverse and
rich Europe. EU-wide licensing should therefore be encouraged, but it should remain
voluntary. Contractual and commercial freedom must be preserved.
While we share the Commission’s views that there are practical difficulties linked to the
identification of the country of origin for internet services, we cannot see any advantages in
extending the application of this principle enshrined in the EU Cable and Satellite Directive to
the Internet. Suggesting that once an online service is licensed in one EU territory, for
example the territory with which the service provider is most closely linked, then this license
would cover all EU territories, would have tremendous consequences for rightsholders. The
extension of this principle to the Internet would limit the making available right. We consider
that any potential limitation on this exclusive right would be damaging to the Digital Single
Market since it would de-incentivise rightsholders who rely on this right to drive new
business models. The “country-of-origin” principle for online licensing allows for forum
shopping for the lowest price. This was also recognised by the Commission’s Study on the
Application of the Information Society Directive.
In fact, maybe one should seriously consider whether it is appropriate to maintain such
principle at all given, as even the Commission acknowledges in its Green Paper on the online
distribution of AV in the EU that “more than fifteen years after the application of the relevant
Directive, this approach does not seem to have led to a broad emergence of pan-European
satellite broadcasting”. This clearly shows that licensing and territoriality is not an obstacle to
the development of pan-European satellite services and there is no evidence showing why the
effect in the context of online services would be different. Satellite broadcasting services that
have succeeded are the ones that offer their customers services tailored to local taste. This is
because the EU is made of a compilation of different cultures and languages, and this
European cultural diversity is something that we should protect.
In relation to targeting, we also think that it has its problems. For example, would a service
provider providing a service in the English language be considered as targeting all the EU or
just the UK and Ireland? This needs to be thought through. The targeting principle also poses
problems in relation to the enforcement of copyright, as when an infringement of copyright
takes place, the courts designated would only have jurisdiction limited to the damage that has
arisen on the territory deliberately targeted by the infringer. This principle will also cause
legal uncertainty as “the target” of the exploitation would need to be defined on a case by case
basis.
In practical terms, online licensing (download, streaming) is based on the tariff of destination
principle, i.e. for each territory the tariff of the local collecting society applies or is
referenced, even if the license is being granted from one territory on a pan-European basis.
Synch licenses are in many cases granted as a package price for several territories, however,
the price is determined on the basis of standard pricing in the territories concerned.

required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"

     NO OPINION


9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
 your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief29)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no need to clarify the territorial scope of the “making available” rights.
However, we do believe that there is a need to ensure a better implementation of Article 8.3 of
the Copyright Directive (availability of pan European injunctive relief). Pan-European
injunctive reliefs should work effectively in practice. As stated in the Directive, each Member
State shall take any and all measures necessary to ensure that rightsholders whose interests
have been affected by an infringing activity carried out on its territory can bring an action for
damages and/or apply for an injunction and, where appropriate, for the seizure of infringing
material. EU Member States shall ensure that rightsholders are in a position to apply for an
injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a
copyright or a related right.
In practice, litigation already takes place where the infringing act takes place (country where
the act of upload happens and where the content is accessed). This approach has also been
confirmed by national courts.
     NO
     NO OPINION

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?


28
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
29
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              15
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
     NO
In any licensing situation there is a whole bundle of rights to deal with and in most
circumstances these two rights are licensed together under one agreement for the ease of the
end user. Music publishers have worked hard to simplify the process, and rightsholders have
been providing licenses to respond to this issue for years now with no difficulties.
     NO OPINION

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU30 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU31 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
As mentioned by the Commission in this consultation document, there are various cases
pending before the CJEU. Therefore we believe that it would be premature to come up with a
solution without having prior clarification from the Court on this matter. However, noting
this, there are some judgements by national courts that are relevant and useful. In the
Netherlands, the District Court of The Hague has ruled that that a website that is embedding
or linking to radio streams without a licence infringes copyright32. In another case33, the Court
of Amsterdam decided that publishing hyperlinks to copyrighted content is, under certain
circumstances, a copyright infringement. For this publication to be an infringement, there
must be an intervention, a new audience and profit (this does necessarily have to be economic
profit; it can be the attraction of new visitors/customers).
In our view, since hyperlinking is an essential part of the way the Internet functions, AEDEM
considers that placing of hyperlinks without the authorisation of the rightsholders should be
considered as an infringement to copyright. The supply of a link to a certain copyrighted work

on a website should constitute an act of communication to the public within the meaning of
Article 3(1) of the EU Copyright Directive and therefore should need the authorisation of the
rightsholder. The nature of the content to which the hyperlink is leading is crucial: if it leads
to licensed content, then there is no infringement. However, if the hyperlink leads to
unlicensed content the making available of which has not been authorised by the rightsholder,
then there is an infringement.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
     NO OPINION


12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
As with question 11 above, and given the pending cases before the CJEU, we believe that it
would be premature to come up with a solution without having prior clarification from the
court. We further believe that the Copyright Directive already provides the answer to this
question. In particular, Article 5.1 of the Directive outlines when the exclusive right of
reproduction can be exempted. That is; only temporary acts of reproduction, which are
transient or incidental and an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose
sole purpose is to enable (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an
intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have
no independent economic significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right.
Browsing falls within the remits of Article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive and was considered
by the Commission when drafting this Article - as per Recital 33 of the Copyright Directive.
In light of this, AEDEM takes the position that no broadening of this existing copyright
exception should be considered and that this exception should remain subject to all its pre-
conditions. In particular, we consider that the condition that only temporary acts of
reproduction “which have no independent economic significance” is crucial. For example,
viewing a website where music is streamed can be considered as browsing. However this act
has an “independent economic significance” and should be considered out of the scope of
browsing and therefore subject to the rightsholders’ authorisation.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
     NO OPINION

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further

                                                                                                17
distribution of that tangible article)34. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)35. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The resale of a previously purchased digital content is not comparable to resale of a product in
the analogue world. Downloading a digital file is not a purchase but a licence to make a
digital copy, so cannot be deemed to be ‘owned’ as it would be in the analogue world.
Licences for each digital service are different: it is not about ownership of digital content. In
the field of music, digital content can be duplicated with no degradation whatsoever; digital
copies are perfect replicas of the original and any number of copies can be made from the
original, with no control whatsoever. Further, it can be impossible to tell which file is the
original copy. Consequently, enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content
would be the same thing as abolishing the reproduction right enshrined in the EU Copyright
Directive. It would also open the door to the legalisation of piracy: a digital first sale
exception would allow users to create perfect copies of the original work and distribute any
number of these copies to others without the creator receiving any compensation.
Enabling this would also have as a consequence the proliferation of technical protection
measures that consumers dislike so much. In addition, it would also have the unwanted effect
of increasing the price of the first original copy, which would also be unwelcomed by
consumers.
In addition, there is no economic reason to enable the resale of digital content. In the digital
world, digital music services such as Spotify already allow consumers to share entire playlists
for free. Similarly, businesses have developed to provide libraries with the ability to stream
music to their users with prices adjusted to reflect different library budgets. There is therefore
no need to introduce measures to change the status quo, it is already being addressed by the
marketplace.

34
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
35
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              18
C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute36. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered37.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
It has been internationally accepted that copyright arises from the simple creation of a work or
subject-matter without the necessity of an application or registration. This principle is
enshrined in Article 5 (2) of the Berne Convention stating that the enjoyment and the exercise
of copyright shall not be subject to any formality.
We consider therefore that there is no reason to change the status quo.
     NO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Imposing a registration system in the EU would only create more burdens for rightsholders
while not ensuring that there is an effective protection of their rights.
In addition, “registration” is already taking place one way or the other: Rightsholders are in
the majority of the cases “registered” to a CMO. Therefore, there is no need to establish yet
another registration system. What needs to be done is to ensure that CMOs’ databases contain
only “clean” data and accurate information of rights ownership in order to facilitate efficient
cross border licensing and the distribution of royalties to the relevant rightsholders in a
consistent manner across Europe. In addition, authors and composers also see their rights
“registered” in their music publishers’ databases.
So, bearing in mind that there are several “registrations” possible in place, the challenge to be
addressed now would be getting all these databases to contain clean and up to date data easily
displayable to the interested party in a practical way. In this regard, the music industry is
already working towards a Global Repertoire Database (GRD) which will provide, for the
first time ever, a single, comprehensive and authoritative representation of the global


36
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
37
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             19
ownership and control of musical works for the benefit of authors and composers, music
publishers, CMOs, users and consumers.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
As mentioned above, rightsholders are already registering their rights through CMOs, for
them to manage their rights and distribute back to the appropriate rightsholder the royalties
due. In our view, this should be the only registration that should be envisaged. The incentive
is no less than the certainty that when a CMO is working efficiently and in a transparent way,
rightsholders are ensured their royalties.
In addition, if a registry was deemed to be authoritative (i.e. GRD), it could in some way help
with enforcement of rightsholders’ rights.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed38, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database39 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition40 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub41 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
In its Communication “A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights”, the Commission
stated that interoperable online databases should help identify rightsholders and foster the
development of licensing infrastructures. In the same Communication, the Commission
announced that it would support measures to make it simpler and efficient to access copyright
protected works through innovative licensing technologies, certification of licensing
infrastructures, identification and data exchange of actual usage and electronic data
management. It committed to encourage and support projects undertaken by various
stakeholders to develop automated and integrated standards-based rights management
infrastructures.
38
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

As you know, the international music publishing community is committed to, and deeply
involved in the ambitious project of a Global Repertoire Database (GRD).
While the pressing need for the establishment of the GRD has long been recognised in the
music community, one of the key reasons for its development was recently confirmed when
data assessment exercises carried out by the various GRD work strands revealed the
shockingly poor quality of data with which European CMOs are currently working. [ We
know that the Commission has signalled the importance of an effective processing of data,
and the above examples highlight the urgency of delivering a first release of the GRD by 2016
as per the current schedule. Data inaccuracies such as these prevent the correct processing and
invoicing of uses of musical works and undermine the legitimacy of the system of rights
administration in Europe.
Since the formation of the GRD Working Group (WG), music publishers have been
cooperating closely with composers, songwriters, CMOs and digital service providers to bring
the idea of a single, authoritative database on global ownership and control of musical works
to fruition. From September 2011 to March 2012, the GRD WG completed a Stakeholder
Engagement and Scoping Study to determine the technical, data, business process and
organisational design aspects of the GRD. Since the launch of the Requirements and Design
phase in October 2012, representatives of participating stakeholder groups have been hard at
work, defining the GRD business requirements, data standards, technology blueprint and
business design. Following considerable investment of time and effort, the Requirements and
Design phase was completed in May of last year. The project moved into technology build in
October 2013, with a first release anticipated in 2016.
This is a crucial project and there remains an acute need to establish the GRD as soon as
technically feasible. A single authoritative database on musical works ownership and control
would not only bring immense benefits to the individual players, big and small, in the music
industry by reducing costs and administrative burdens, it would also help drive forward the
digital economy, both in Europe and internationally. We are aware from our participation in
the LfE dialogue that the Commission is interested in developing practical industry-led
solutions in the areas of licensing and cross-border portability of online content, and we
believe that the GRD is integral to this process.
In our view, the Commission should continue to promote the development and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases, in particular the GRD. First
and foremost, political support from the Commission is needed. The unprecedented level of
ambition and scale associated with this global project makes it dependent on the reliable
support and cooperation of all participating stakeholder organisations. In order to continue
making developments in this project, we need to keep pushing ahead with the building of the
GRD. AEDEM realises this and, on behalf of the global music publishing community, we are
fully committed to working towards this goal. At this advanced stage of the project, any
delay, lack of commitment or inability to compromise among the participating organisations
could result in irreparable harm to the GRD’s legitimacy and momentum, and endanger its
timely implementation. Complete cooperation is required in order for all parties to be able to
reap the full benefits of this innovative project. In this respect, the Commission’s continued
support and active encouragement on this issue would be very much appreciated.
It could also be envisaged requesting funding support from the Commission. European
programmes like COSME (EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)) and the ICT 2014 - Information and Communications
Technologies can be considered in this regard.

                                                                                            21
Lastly, and given that the GRD will provide information to users that will allow for a more
streamlined online licensing environment, the participation of the Commission in the
development of other international initiatives in this field would most likely be redundant and
create uncertainty and discord among participants.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention42 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
AEDEM considers the current term of protection (70 p.m.a. for authors and 70 for performers
and sound recordings) is still very much appropriate in the digital environment.
Indeed, as demonstrated in the Commission's impact study43, term extension will give average
performers additional income ranging from € 150 to € 2000 per year. These amounts, mostly
attributable to airplay royalties, are insignificant for the big music superstars but they are
considerable for many musical performers, session musicians in particular.
Music publishers spend a lot of time and money bringing writers to the market. They provide
significant advanced payments to these artists before these artists make any profit. Obviously
they are only able to invest if they can get compensated for their rights; developing talent is an
expensive business. Creative industries are long term industries that need significant
investments to exist and develop. In an increasingly aging society, life plus 70 is an
appropriate term of protection. Anything shorter than that has often proven to be too short to
recoup on those investments. It has also often proven insufficient to allow creators and their
descendants to legitimately benefit from the exploitation of their works.
In addition, the term of protection of 70 p.m.a. for authors is in line with the term of
protection in most of EU’s main trading partners. Inconsistency in the term of protection
would make it difficult to achieve an appropriate level of efficiency in the management and
the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on an international scale. A reduction
of the term of protection in the EU would place EU authors at a clear disadvantage vis à vis
their main trading partners.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC44.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law45. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)46, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional47, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")48.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there


44
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
45
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
46
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
47
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
48
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            23
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
There is no indication that the different national approaches on some exceptions create
difficulties for consumers / users regarding the use of online services.
The most relevant and important copyright exceptions and limitations have been adopted by
the majority of EU Member States. When a Member State has not implemented a certain
exception it is just due to national specificities, and we don’t believe that this has a cross
border impact that needs to be addressed.
  NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
In our view, the current EU exceptions and limitations regime enables EU Member States to
deal adequately with these issues. AEDEM does not see any Internal Market need to make the
exceptions mandatory or a need for a mandatory harmonisation of such exceptions.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
The rationale behind the EU exceptions and limitations regime is to allow people to use
copyrighted works for a specific purpose as long as it complies with the internationally
recognised principle of the Three Step Test. This Test only allows exemptions in cases which
do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightsholder.
In light of this, AEDEM believes that the way exceptions and limitations are defined in the
EU Copyright Directive already provides a good balance between rightsholders’ and users’
needs. These exceptions and limitations have also shown to be sufficiently flexible to meet the
demands of the move from the analogue to digital world. Extending the scope of existing


                                                                                                 24
exceptions is not the way forward to provide effective and quicker access to those that require
it.
In addition, when considering the need to add or remove exceptions and limitations from the
existing list, a distinction should be made between what is in the public interest and what is
free riding. In our view, an extension of the scope of the current exceptions is undesired. Calls
from certain stakeholders for a re-opening of the Directive and a re-examination of its list of
exceptions often hide the intention to weaken the copyright framework so that they can
develop new commercial services for free at the cost of the creative and economical efforts of
rightsholders. It should not be forgotten that with technological developments, piracy has
increased significantly. Therefore any exceptions and limitations must take account the
further increased risks that rightsholders face, particularly in the absence of adequate
collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who often hide behind existing
limitations of liability and data protection rules.
In our view, any changes envisaged should be made taking due consideration of the following
factors: assessment of the impact of each exception on the Internal Market; that the proposed
policy is supported by robust economic evidence; and that the potential changes are
compatible with international copyright law and the Three Step Test.



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
  NO – Please explain why
As mentioned in earlier responses, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive was drafted taking
into account the different needs and traditions in EU Member States. The focus should be a
good application of these exceptions by EU Member States.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


                                                                                              25
As explained above, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive was drafted taking into account
the different needs and traditions in EU Member States. While it is true that the way that
different EU Member States have implemented these exceptions into their national law varies
in some cases, this is to address specific national needs. This territoriality of the exceptions
and limitations does not, in our view, distort or and create significant discrepancies in the
Internal Market that need to be addressed.
     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
The EU Copyright Directive only mandates the application of a fair compensation principle to
the private copying exception and leaves the matter at the discretion of EU Member States for
the other exceptions. In addition, some EU Member States also apply the fair compensation
principle to the educational exception. In our view, the status quo should continue to prevail.
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at a national level were to have a cross
border effect, the obligation of fair compensation should take place where the harm is done,
by the person whose acts caused the harm in that country, in accordance with the CJEU
Padawan decision49. The making available right also enters into play.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving50 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions51. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive52.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
AEDEM is liaising with print publishers and with the print sector (book sector).
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national

   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
51
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                              26
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

     NO OPINION


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We don’t think that there are any problems. Should specific problems arise, these can be
solved negotiated solutions between rightsholders and users, such as licensing (either directly
negotiated by rightsholders or via CMOs). In our view, negotiations between rightsholders
and users are more flexible and achieved more quickly than legislation, and therefore the
preferred option. In any case, if any problems arise, Article 5 of the EU Copyright Directive
would provide a solution to the problem.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to


                                                                                            27
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?



33.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
We don’t think that there are any problems. Should specific problems arise, these can be
solved by negotiated solutions between rightsholders and users, such as licensing (either
directly negotiated by rightsholders or via CMOs). In our view, negotiations between
rightsholders and users are more flexible and quicker achieved than legislation, and therefore
the preferred option.

In addition, in our view, giving e-lending rights to libraries would be extremely harmful
because it would destroy the existing market. In Finland, for example, only creators are
remunerated for the lending of physical products; while music and book publishers and record
labels get nothing. The e-lending right would make the situation even worse.


4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other53. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)54.

B.      Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC55 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC56 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 58.

The Marrakesh Treaty59 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in

   For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                                             32
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”61. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs62. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
62
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           34
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions63.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
     NO
First of all, and as recognised by the Commission in this consultation paper, it must be
emphasised that no consensus was reached among participants of the WG2 in LfE on either
the problems to be addressed or on the definition of user generated content (UGC). This
uncertainty is already a clear indicator of the difficulties and risks of solving a problem that
has not even been identified.
As mentioned by rightsholders in LfE WG2 discussions, we have not experienced significant
problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works. The reason is simply
that UGC is not a new and unaddressed market. It is merely the broadening of the
synchronisation market in which rightsholders have been active for years. UGC is a derivative
work and there are mechanisms in place to deal with derivative works (i.e. licensing
solutions). Rightsholders have been developing, and continue doing so, licensing solutions
for the so-called UGC and for small scale licensing. The way licences are being offered and
the scope of these licences makes it easy and swift for users to get a licence for musical
works. In LfE we were able to learn about specific initiatives on UGC being carried out by
CMOs on behalf of its members (authors and composers and music publishers). In addition,
music publishers in particular are engaging in discussions with collective management
organisations and authors and composers to develop guidelines that facilitate and standardise
small-scale licensing. Music publishers are also engaging in discussions with users on this
matter. For example, the NMPA (National Music Publishers Association in the US) and

YouTube recently entered into an agreement covering synchronisation rights on behalf of
songwriters, as well as versions of their songs. Thus, we do not believe that UGC raises any
new specific issues and even if it did, we think that the current EU’s Copyright Acquis is
well-equipped to address them. The current framework already provides for the necessary
conditions to foster and to promote UGC. In the past few years, many interactive Internet
websites dedicated to allow users to express their creativity by using protected works have
flourished within the current legal framework (i.e. DailyMotion) This proves that the current
legal framework works and allows for UGC to develop.
  NO OPINION


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
The licensing solutions that have been developed and are being developed through
collaboration within the creative industries ensure that the created works are properly
identified. This was demonstrated by the presentations and discussions at the LfE meetings.
AEDEM does not consider that legislative intervention is needed.
  NO OPINION


60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
We find it surprising that the dilemma on the topic of UGC seems to be trying to ensure that
creators of UGC receive remuneration for their work while also ensuring that they have all the
possible flexibility to use others’ work to create their content.
In any case, marketplace agreements like the YouTube mentioned above or the DailyMotion
website show that it is possible to ensure that creators receive fair compensation for the use of
a work created out of an existing work.

62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

63.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As mentioned in question 58 above, AEDEM does not see any problem emanating from
UGC. UGC is not a new concept as such. UGC is a derivative work and there are mechanisms
in place to deal with derivative works (i.e. simple licensing solutions available on major
platforms/ or by way of a commercial agreement). In our view, the authors of all “derivative
works”, including UGC, must obtain a license to use the pre-existing material. Songwriters
and those who invest in their work (music publishers) have a longstanding expectation that
derivative works can be monetised. There is a viable commercial marketplace in existence for
the licensing of these works, and there is no compelling reason to grant an exception for
UGC.
Such an exception would cut across the rightsholder’s ability to license and generate
revenues. There is danger that we are facing an exception positioned in terms of “UGC”
when really we are talking about clear synch licensing opportunities which can and should be
managed within the licensing framework. Any changes to the law that would allow users to
make derivative works from musical compositions without a license would have a significant
and negative impact on songwriters and music publishers because songwriters and music
publishers make the vast majority of their living from licensing derivative works. In addition
having an exception on UGC would pose difficulties when ensuring that moral rights are
maintained. Music publishers play a vital role in defending the rights of creators, including
moral rights.
We are aware of the calls from some sectors urging the EU to introduce a new exception for
UGC based, for example, on the US “fair use” principle. This would simply not work in the
EU. The differences between the civil law tradition that exist in the majority of the EU
Member States and the common law approach in the US are too big to overcome. In addition,
the US “fair use” doctrine is based on decades of case law. The EU could not just insert the
“fair use” principle from one day to the next as the consequent legal uncertainty would be
tremendous. The EU has an efficient copyright framework based on specific exceptions and
limitations, which together with the Three-Step Test provide for the necessary flexibility
while ensuring legal certainty. For example, one form of UGC is already addressed in the EU
Copyright Directive via Article 5.3(k) that exempts uses "for the purposes of caricature,
parody or pastiche". We therefore take the view that existing exceptions already provide for
the necessary conditions to foster UGC and that there is no (practical or economic) evidence
to the contrary.
It is also worth noting that the consideration of any kind of exception on this matter without
seriously considering an increased liability of ISPs would be fatal for the creative industry. As
mentioned earlier, there are increasingly more websites dedicated to the facilitation of the
creation of UGC. The activities of these websites go beyond merely “hosting” and therefore
they can no longer hide behind Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive to avoid liability. A
reinterpretation of this Article is urgently needed.
To conclude, the main problem that we -as rightsholders- experience from the way the users
are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the

                                                                                              37
Internet is piracy. Therefore any measure on UGC would need to be accompanied by effective
measures on IPR enforcement. Educational measures should also be envisaged. Time needs to
be devoted to educating consumers on the legal uses of content and on the importance of the
respect of copyright for the creative industries and for a culturally rich world in general.



     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying64. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees6566.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions67 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
AEDEM considers that there is no need for further clarification. The scope and application of
private copying and reprography exceptions is currently being clarified by the CJEU and at
national level. Recent cases such as Padawan68, Stichting de Thuiskopie v. Opus69, Austro-
Mechana70 and VG Wort71, among others, provide the clarification needed on the scope of the
application of private copying. In addition, cases still pending before the CJEU will provide

further clarification potentially needed. This was also confirmed by High Level Mediator Mr
Vitorino in his Recommendations.
In the above mentioned cases, the Court has confirmed that in those countries where
consumers are allowed by law to make private copies of copyright protected content,
rightsholders have a right to be fairly compensated for these reproductions. Private copying
levies have been introduced in the majority of the EU Member States as a way to guarantee
this fair compensation. In Padawan, the Court confirms that the act of copying copyright
protected content by consumers must be considered as an act which is likely to cause harm to
the rightsholder, and consequently justifies the application of a levy. The Court made clear
that levies should be calculated according to the assumed harm sustained by rightsholders by
the private copying in question. In Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus, the Court addressed the
obligation of a country that has introduced the private copying exception to provide fair
compensation and stressed that the “harm” suffered by the rightsholders arises on the territory
where the final private users reside. In the Austro-Mechana Case, the Court gives guidance on
practical implementation of levies both nationally and in cross-border trade.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?72
     YES – Please explain
According to the EU Copyright Directive, if a license fee has already been paid for the use of
a service, then no additional private copying levy is due. In our view, this criterion should not
be deemed applicable when there are two separate uses only one of which is licensed. For
example, if a consumer has purchased a TV licence, making copies of programs is not
included in such a licence, it is a separate use stemming from a separate right from which
private copying exceptions may arise. We believe that double payment for double use is not
double payment and should not be considered as being the instance provided for in this
criterion in the Directive.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
The reasoning behind levies is to compensate rightsholders for the harm that is likely to arise
for private copying practices relating to musical works. Nowadays levies are hardly
“compensating” rightsholders. The levy payment is due on devices and equipment and not in
relation to specific works being copied as it would be impossible to control the amount of
copying being carried out. This is why for publishers licensing the reproduction of a work is
always the preferred option whenever possible, practicable and enforceable. Licensing is also
the best way to keep up-to-date with new online services and ensure that rightsholders are
remunerated fairly.
72
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          39
As new online services develop the possibilities for licensing increase. However, this does not
in any way mean that levies should be eradicated. In relation to cloud computing, for
example, there is a difference between the licensing position of the cloud service, and the
devices via which such cloud service is accessed. While cloud services should be subject to
licensing and not to a levy, the devices can be levied without prejudice to the licensing
position of the cloud service. Consumers now have more recording devices and equipment
than ever before and therefore justification for levies subsists. Levies should continue to exist
to cover the consumer’s private copy with a focus on the private nature of the copy.

In the digital world, private copies are “perfect clones” of the original. Concerning the control
of private copying, it seems appropriate to distinguish between copying from an online digital
source (website) to an online digital medium (cloud storage facility) or copying from an
offline digital source (CD) to an offline digital medium (MP3 player). Whereas the latter act
of copying is difficult to manage and would therefore fall under the private copying exception
subject to equitable compensation, the former can easily be controlled and licensed. In our
view, there is no justification for a model of exception if the activities are licensable and
licensed. Consequently, any new exception should not cover online digital services (be it as a
source or as a medium of the private copying)73.

67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?74
     YES – Please explain
We believe that it would be helpful to display the levy on each invoice in the sales chain,
including on the consumer's invoice. Transparency is essential to ensure that the appropriate
levy rate is applied, that no double payment takes place in case of export, that no avoidance of
payment occur and that auditing is aided.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments75.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

could help to remedy the situation.
  NO – Please explain
Although there are indeed disparities in the methods of calculating levy tariffs as well as
disparities in equipment and media, the situation is well managed and under control.
While AEDEM accepts that double payment may arise in cross border transactions,
nonetheless, most EU Member States have refund systems in place to deal with this problem.
Refunds for exports are usually set by legislation or private agreements between CMOs and
the exporters.
In our view, the best way to avoid double payment in cross border sales is that the country
where the obligation of payment of the levy should arise and therefore the private copying
rate is applicable should continue to be the country where the sale takes place. In case of
distance sales, the country should be the one where the end user resides. In cases where the
manufacturer, importer, distributor and retailer continue to pay the levy (and then revert it on
to the end user), existing refund systems should be guaranteed to avoid double payment.
  NO OPINION

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
Given the disparities in the national methods of calculating levy tariffs and in the equipment
and media which warrant levy payments, we would recommend that an independent study be
commissioned to reflect the status quo regarding the products which attract levies and the
methodologies used for calculating levies in all the various EU Member States. Following
this, attempts should be made at harmonising the types of devices which attract or should
attract levies and the methods for calculating levy tariffs, with the involvement of the relevant
stakeholders. Both should remain subject to regular reviews in order to take account of
technological developments and evolving consumer behaviour in line with Recital 39 of the
EU Copyright Directive.
For example, in Germany, the system was changed some years ago. While previously the rate
was set by the Department of Justice (and therefore remained rather low over the years) it is
now supposed to be negotiated between rightsholders and users. In practice, this does not
work as there is no incentive for users to come to a quick understanding. As a result,
rightsholders do not see any money for years. This system is something that we don’t want to
have at EU level.
We also believe that the EU should not move in the direction of the various systems that are
being adopted at national level and that have nothing to do with the EU exception envisaged

                                                                                              41
in the EU Copyright Directive. We are referring in particular to the initiatives in the UK and
Spain where the systems being introduced are incompatible with EU Law as they fail to
provide for an appropriate system of fair remuneration for creators and rightsholders.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers76 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract77. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
Creators deserve fair remuneration from their works. They also deserve the guarantee of fair
remuneration in arms-length freely negotiated agreements with representatives within an
environment of choice. In our view the best way to ensure that authors and composers are
fairly remunerated for their work is to have effective copyright systems and effective
measures on IPR enforcement.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
     YES – Please explain
     NO – Please explain why

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?

     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

Directive 2004/48/EE78 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text79. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose80. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure81. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
It is crucial that there is a high quality civil enforcement system of Intellectual Property
Rights (IPRs) in the EU. Efficiency and effectiveness of civil proceedings in cases concerning
infringements of IPRs is poor.
According to our members, litigation in cases concerning the infringement of IPRs is both
costly and long and there is the additional difficulty of identifying and establishing the
territorial liability of the infringer. We believe that in many cases, alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms are an effective solution. Whether they are sufficiently accessible to
the parties affected by the infringement depends however on the different national systems.
We also don’t think that it should be more important to stop infringements that are committed
with commercial purpose (for profit) than infringements committed not for profit. AEDEM
believes that it would be very dangerous to draw the line between what is considered for
profit and what is considered not for profit. In the first place a clear definition should be
provided, and the concept of potential harm to the rightsholder should be taken into account.
Due to the fact that the financial gains from piracy can be very substantial and also difficult to
ascertain, pre-established or multiple damages could be an alternative solution to any lost
profit that in many cases would be almost impossible to prove. In this respect, a
predetermined calculation method should set a figure which is sufficiently high to compensate
the rightsholder for the likely damage and to act as a deterrent. In addition, drawing the
distinction between for profit and not for profit infringements violates the principles enshrined
in the Three Step Test in that, even if the infringement does not lead to financial gains for the
infringer, it can prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightsholder. Furthermore,
differentiating between for profit and not for profit infringement ignores the market impact
criterion.

of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
80
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
81
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           43
Another area that needs attention is civil court proceedings. The intention when instigating
civil law court proceedings concerning infringements of IPRs is to stop the infringing activity,
dissuade the infringing behaviour, take measures to prevent further infringements and to be
compensated for the infringements. It could be useful to establish at EU level model rules for
fast track proceedings for civil law cases concerning IPR infringements, if the rules were to be
based on those procedures and practices carried out in the UK and Germany.
In relation to the remedies for copyright infringement, and more specifically concerning
damages and injunctions, AEDEM considers that the 2004 Enforcement Directive, in its
current form, lacks clarity in some aspects and that the Commission should consider
remedying this by proposing specific improvements/clarifications. We are particularly
concerned about Article 11 on injunctions and Article 13 on damages, where there is great
inconsistency among Member States.
The following are examples of inconsistency:
Injunctions:
As has been noted by the report of the Legal Sub-Group of the European Counterfeiting and
Anti-Piracy Observatory, the conditions imposed by national law or by jurisprudence for
injunctions with respect to intermediaries vary widely from one Member State to another. In
some Member States Article 8(3) has either not been implemented effectively or not been
implemented at all.
In some Member States it is not possible to issue injunctions unless the liability of an
intermediary is established, contrary to Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, as well as to
Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive, which do not link injunctions with the liability of an
intermediary.
In some Member States, national courts hold that rightsholders should seek their remedy by
taking infringement proceedings against the primary infringers. This prevents rightsholders
from obtaining relief due to the high costs that pursuing all individual infringers supposes.
In some Member States, injunctions against intermediaries are ineffective as they only instruct
the intermediary from allowing the exact same infringement to happen (in practice it is quite
possible that the same infringer may engage in future infringements of the same or different
titles or products owned by the rightsholder).
Rightsholders experience significant delays in obtaining injunctions against intermediaries.
In some Member States injunctions aimed at preventing infringement of copyright are only
available on a title-specific basis that have been adduced in evidence.
Damages:
AEDEM agrees with the Commission that “at present, damages awarded in IPR cases remain
comparatively low” and “do not currently appear to effectively dissuade potential infringers
from engaging in illegal activities”. Indeed, unless the Directive includes measures to enable
rightsholders to recover the full extent of their loss, including attorney’s fees, expert costs and
all costs incurred in establishing that an infringement had been committed, including court
fees and fees payable to ISPs for providing the personal data of the infringer, the inability to
recuperate such costs would often discourage rightsholders from pursuing legal action,
particularly small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), which make up the vast majority of
music publishers and our members.
It needs to be noted that due to the fact that the level of damages is relatively low, parties
often prefer to settle disputes out of court.

                                                                                                44
In order to have an adequate compensatory and deterrent effect, damages awards should be
such that they put the rightsholder in the position he or she would have been in had the
infringement not taken place; and that they serve to discourage both repeat and would-be
infringers.
Inconsistencies and differences in implementation and interpretation of the Directive across
Member States make damages claims uncertain and costly. In some Member States, the basis
on which damages are calculated depends on proving the number of copies made; in others,
the calculation is made on a royalty basis; in others, the rightsholder has to prove the actual
damage suffered. Currently, national courts face significant difficulties in calculating and
awarding compensation due to the confusion in interpreting the legal framework and the
problems with the evidence requirements that rightsholders must meet to substantiate
damages claims. The result is that in many cases rightsholders are only compensated for lost
profits and infringers are not adequately deterred by the current damages system. Guidelines
for the calculation of damages would be particularly useful in copyright cases. The
implementation of a statutory damages regime is required to make civil enforcement viable.
The loss of profit standard is incredibly difficult and very costly to calculate.
In some Member States, damages are only available where infringements are committed on a
commercial scale. In others, no compensation is awarded where the infringer has no
knowledge of the infringement and is only awarded for intentional or negligent infringements.
AEDEM believes that there ought to be common standards of “actual knowledge” and
“awareness” as clarification is needed to prevent further obstacles being placed between the
rightsholders and the enforcement of their rights.
In conclusion, to render the civil enforcement system more efficient in the EU, we would ask
for a cross border/pan-European injunction system; recognition of national judgements across
borders; and liability only applies to completely neutral hosting services (that is, a revision of
the 2000 E-commerce Directive); that an injunction against a specific service obtained in one
Member State can be enforced in another Member State, either directly or by way of an
expedited procedure. In addition, it is also key that rightsholders have access to necessary data
from the ISPs so they can virtually identify the infringer and enforce their rights.
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION


76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
Absolutely not. The current framework is not at all clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries. It is difficult however to answer to this question without
touching upon the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by the E-
commerce Directive, which, as the Commission has expressed in footnote 77, will remain
unchanged. This is in our view a lost opportunity as there is clear problem with the safe
harbour provisions present in the E-commerce Directive. These provisions have worked as a
disincentive instead of as an incentive for ISPs to cooperate. There has been not such
voluntary cooperation between ISPs and content providers because the former have often


                                                                                               45
raised their fear that by cooperating they would lose their intermediary status and the
exemption for liability dependent on that status.
Unfortunately, the anachronisms in the wording of the safe harbour provisions in the E-
commerce Directive have an impact on the Enforcement Directive which was framed around
physical format piracy and built on legislation such as the E-commerce Directive. Online
piracy not only appears in the traditional hosting environment but also through P2P, cyber-
lockers, etc. In addition, many infringing websites hide behind Article 14 of the E-Commerce
Directive claiming that they are only hosting content to avoid liability. The incentives put in
place by the EU Enforcement Directive are insufficient and need clarification.
In relation to file-sharing, it is not practically possible to stop infringing individuals.
Cooperation with ISPs is crucial in this regard. ISPs are the gatekeepers of the Internet. The
vast majority of these ISPs are large companies and businesses, while rightsholders tend to be
SMEs and individuals (publishers, author, compose, etc.). It is therefore unrealistic to suppose
SMEs and individuals could possibly have the resources to deal with all unlicensed uses of
their copyrighted content across all providers. As stated in the Commission Communication
on E-commerce, the mechanisms to stop abuses and illegal information (i.e. illegal content)
should take into account rules of proportionality. It is only common sense that large
businesses, particularly those dependant on content for survival, should be more vigilant and
take greater responsibilities for the illegal content on their services than SMEs, simply
because they are better “equipped” than SMEs and composers to prevent illegal activities on
their sites, due to their size and turnover and because they have created a business based on
other people’s rights.
It is through the efforts of ISPs and other intermediaries, working with rightsholders, that
effective solutions can be found. Notice and action procedures may be useful for hosting
services but not for other forms of online infringement. Steps that can be taken are, for
example, sending education messages to subscribers whose accounts have been identified as
infringing, and warn them that refusal to stop the infringement can lead to meaningful
consequences, filtering, site-blocking, etc.
The measures above have been accepted by policy makers in different EU Member States.
Voluntary agreements between rightsholders and ISPs are also starting to develop. However,
voluntary agreements are not the only solution as not all ISPs are willing to cooperate, and
rightsholders don’t have the means to enter into negotiations with every single ISP. As a
consequence, the most effective way to fight theft is by legislating. The EU needs effective
rules that impose clear obligations for ISPs and other intermediaries to cooperate in the IPR
enforcement. This should be supported by sanctions for non-compliance.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
However, rightsholders are encountering inconsistencies in the way in which different EU
Member States are interpreting the relationship between the right of information and data
protection, with a number of countries interpreting legislation in such a way as to give
preference to data protection over the right of information, and hence making difficult the
enforcement of their rights.



                                                                                             46
This is true despite the ruling in the Promusicae Case82 in which it was stated that EU Law
requires a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the
Community legal order which include the fundamental rights to property and to an effective
remedy and the rights protecting personal data and private life. The ruling held that the
authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a
manner consistent with the Directives but must also make sure that they do not rely on an
interpretation which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other
general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.
In our view, when considering the right to an effective remedy, EU Member States should
take into account that rightsholders may find it difficult to prove infringement without the
information that they are seeking under the right of information. We believe that EU Member
States should not impose a requirement that infringement should be proved as a pre-condition
for granting an order for disclosure. The words “without prejudice” in Article 8(3) of the EU
Enforcement Directive do not mean that legislation protecting the rights to protection of
personal data should take precedence over the right of information. Instead, and in accordance
with the Promusicae ruling, national courts should have regard to such rights when deciding
whether or not to grant an order pursuant to the right of information.
In addition, in order to ensure that rightsholders are not prevented from gathering evidence of
online copyright infringement, we call for confirmation that gathering and processing IP
addresses for the purposes of collecting evidence of infringement is not contrary to EU Law
(i.e. EU Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal
data) and that any national laws that provide that it is must be rectified.
     NO – Please explain
     NO OPINION

      VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
     YES
     NO
On the subject of a possible establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, AEDEM agrees
with the Commission’s assessment of the Green Paper on the online distribution of AV works
in the EU that the “feasibility, actual demand for, and the tangible advantages of, such a title,
together with the consequences of its application alongside existing territorial protection must

be thoroughly examined”. The idea of creating a new European Copyright law that would
replace existing national laws should also be thoroughly examined.
In our view, it is unclear how such EU Copyright Title would work; whether it would be a
voluntary or a mandatory title. Should it be the former, we do not think that it would be
adopted. National laws are already in place and this Title would just duplicate the laws that
already exist at national level adding an extra layer of complexity. If on the other hand, this
Title is conceived to be mandatory, we would be talking about full harmonisation of copyright
throughout the EU. The EU Copyright Framework was conceived taking into account national
cultural and social differences. Fully harmonising the EU copyright laws would entail
Member States losing the ability to implement their own cultural values through copyright. In
addition, a single EU Title in the field of trademarks and patents make sense as it avoids long
procedures in terms of obtaining rights in different countries. This incentive does not exist for
copyright which arises from the single creation of a work. Furthermore, pan-European
licences are already being granted without an EU Title.
In addition, this full harmonisation would only be positive if based on the highest level of
protection granted by any given EU country. Any harmonisation leading to the “lowest
common denominator” approach should be disregarded.
In relation to a single framework for enforcement, we do believe indeed believe that further
harmonisation is needed. (Please see our answer to Section IV)
  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
Further to our comments in question 78 above, we do not believe that this should necessarily
be the way forward. Indeed, the Commission has been considering this idea for quite some
time now (in its 2010 Reflection Paper, “Creative Content in a European Digital Single
Market: Challenges for the Future”, the Commission raised the question of adopting a
“European Copyright Law”). The fact that this idea has not been take up is a proof that this
supposes a huge task to undertake without the certainty that it would bring any real advantage.
