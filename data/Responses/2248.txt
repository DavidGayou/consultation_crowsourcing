    I.      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
            A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
            anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

            B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs
            to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of

certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
12
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                                 7
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
► NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)


The making available right has been codified by the European legislator as a peculiar
subset of a broader right of communication to the public, with which it shares the feature
of covering instances where the public is not present at the place where the original act of
communication takes place. Like in the case of the communication to the public, the
making available right covers situations where the transmission of the work happens from
a distant place from the one where the user is physically located and the fruition of the
work takes place on individual basis.
Differently from other forms of exploitation of the work involving the communication of
the work in front of the public (such as public representations of the work and public
performances in general), whose infringement implies both an actual exploitation of the
work and an actual fruition from a public which is physically present in the place where
the performance takes place, the right of communication to the public has been differently
interpreted by the judicature of the Court of Justice of the EU, as covering even acts of
transmission not followed by an actual fruition of the work. According to the Court,
indeed, the concept of transmission, intrinsic to the right of communication to the public,
simply involves an act of intervention which makes the work available to the public in
such a way that the persons forming the public may access it: what matters being that the
work has been put in a position to be potentially accessed by the public at large (broadly
on this topic see E. Arezzo, Copyright Enforcement on the Internet in the European
Union: Hyperlinks and Making Available Right, forthcoming in Research Handbook on
the Cross-Border Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, P. Torremans (ed.), 2014,
Edward Elgar Publishing.).
The potentiality of access becomes a crucial concept all the more in the case of the
making available right which has been expressly conceived to cover those instances where
a certain work is uploaded on the internet and stay there with the precise purpose of being

14
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                               8
at users’ disposal for fruition. Given the a-territorial nature of the internet, the making
available right should be simultaneously held violated in all countries where the uploaded
content becomes potentially accessible.

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
X YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
A clarification of the territorial scope of the making available right would surely help in
ameliorating    the    enforcement      of    the  rights    in    each   Member     State.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
X YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
As the making available right technically amounts to the act of the content provider storing a
reproduction of the work on its server where it stays at disposal of the cybernauts, it should be
clarified by the EU legislator that such exclusive faculty consists in nothing more than a
peculiar instance of reproduction (see E. Arezzo, Hyperlinks and the Making Available Right
in the European Union: What future for the Internet after Svensson, available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404250). The fragmentation of the act of digital transmission of the
work into two separate exclusive rights – a reproduction right plus a making available –

16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                    9
makes no sense from a technical point of view (since the technical act is just one) and creates
several complication on the exploitation of the rights whenever it happens that they are
collectively administered by separate collecting societies or other similar bodies (E. Arezzo,
Aggregazione e frammentazione dei diritti nella Proposta di Direttiva sulla concessione di
licenze multi territoriali per i diritti online relativi alle opere musicali: quali spazi per le
licenze-multi diritto? in AIDA (Annali italiani di Diritto d’Autore), 2013, 83, at 103 and ff.).
Recall at this regard that in the recent German case Myvideo v. CELAS (MyVideo Broadband
S.R.L. vs. CELAS GmbH, District Court of Munich (Landgericht München), No. 7 O
4139/08 (June 25, 2009)) the Landgericht of Munich annulled the agreement between EMI
Publishing and CELAS whereby the former had granted to the latter the right to administer its
online reproduction rights, while the corresponding communication rights, belonging to the
authors, stayed with GEMA (the German collecting society for authors). The German Court
held that a separation of the two exclusive faculties regarding the online exploitation of works
was not admissible: on the one side, because, for technical reasons, the making available right
is not actionable without a simultaneous and preceding reproduction of the work; on the other
side, and even more interestingly, according to the Court a fragmentation of the online rights
would not be admissible because an act of online reproduction without an act of making
available would not amount to any form of commercial exploitation of the work.
It is therefore suggested that the contours of the making available right be properly redefined
by EU legislators in such a way that digital interactive transmission of a work on the internet
be covered by just one exclusive right.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
Linking practices, regardless of the specific technique used (i.e. surface linking vis-à-vis
deep linking or inline linking etc.), of all kinds should not be considered a form of direct
infringement of copyright (i.e. a violation of the making available right) because linking
does not amount to an act of transmission of a work, which is the first constituent element
of the making available right (E. Arezzo, Hyperlinks and the Making Available Right in the
European Union: What future for the Internet after Svensson, available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404250). This is precisely because the act of linking consists, by
definition, not in an uploading of content but in the provision of a set of technical
information about how such content may be reached. In other words, linking always
presupposes the linked-to content be already uploaded on the net by someone else: this
latter person being the actual infringer if the first act of uploading took place without the
right-holder’s content (in this sense: E. Arezzo, Copyright Enforcement on the Internet in
the European Union: Hyperlinks and Making Available Right, forthcoming in Research
Handbook on the Cross-Border Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, P.
Torremans (ed.), 2014, Edward Elgar Publishing). If one agrees that a certain linking
practice, performed by a third entity different from the one originally authorized by the
right-holder, does not amount to an act of transmission of the work, it then becomes
irrelevant to further analyze the element of the communication of the work to a ‘new
public’, as the two are cumulative elements, both need to be satisfied in order to have a
violation of the making available right.
As a consequence, linking should always be deemed allowed as it does not amount to an
infringement and, therefore, does not require the codification of a specific exception into
EU law.
The CJEU conclusions in the recent Svensson case cannot be shared. The CJEU has
indeed stated, with no legal reasoning, nor technological explanation, that linking amounts
to a communication of the work, shifting the centre of the analysis on the legality of
linking practices on the element of ‘new public’ which, in turn, has been construed around
the concept of open accessibility of the linked-to content (Judgment of the Court, Nils
Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB, Case C-466/12, §§ 19 and ff.). According to the
Court, if the linked-to content has been openly released (i.e. with no restriction measures)
on a certain online location with the right holder’s consent, linking practices shall not be
deemed infringing, as the first act of making available had the effect of communicating
the work to the whole web: therefore, linking could not anyhow further enlarge the range
of potential viewers (Judgment of the Court, Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige
AB, Case C-466/12, §§ 26-27). By contrast, if the linked-to content has been made
available only to a restricted set of users, and linking practices would have the effect of
circumventing the restriction measures inserted with the right holder’s consent to the
specific purpose of restricting access, linking would amount to “[…] an intervention
without which those users would not be able to access the works transmitted […]”: hence,
linking would be deemed infringing as it would actually enlarge the set of potential
viewers of the work, satisfying the element of the ‘new public’ (Judgment of the Court,
Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB, Case C-466/12, § 31).
This intricate reasoning is further complicated by the CJEU when it specifies that linking
would be infringing not only when it would allow the circumvention of restriction
                                                                                          11
measures inserted with the right holder’s consent when the protected content had been
initially communicated (i.e. with the first communication of the work on the internet), but
also when “[…] the work is no longer available to the public on the site on which it was
initially communicated or where it is henceforth available on that site only to a restricted
public […]” (italics added) (Judgment of the Court, Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever
Sverige AB, Case C-466/12, § 31, last sentence).
However, if what matters is not anymore the initial act of communication, but rather the
circumstance that the work remains freely available on the internet all the time – i.e. for
the whole author’s life plus seventy years -- things become incredibly complex. In fact,
the practical consequence stemming from this latter sentence is that “linkers” would be
required to constantly monitor the linked-to content, to make sure it has not been removed
from the original website where it had been placed or whether it is still available therein
only in a restricted mode. A request to monitor that the linked-to content remains freely
available on the website where it has been initially uploaded with the copyright holder’s
consent would practically impair the functioning of the internet as it would be extremely
cumbersome for single users and technically unfeasible for providers of internet services
to deal with it (in this sense see E. Arezzo, Hyperlinks and the Making Available Right in
the European Union: What future for the Internet after Svensson, available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404250).

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
X YES – Please explain by giving examples
Digital content that is distributed online does not give the possibility of being resold and not
even lent whenever the technology applied to protect it prevent its transferability and
circumventing such technology amount to an unlawful behaviour since art 4.2 of Directive
2001/29/EC states that the distribution right does not exhaust in the digital environment.
While this has somehow become accepted among users in the music sector, where music that
is legally acquired is in many cases also strictly connected to the physical device, i.e.
MP3reader, via which it is listened to, it currently presents an issue in relation to the e-books
as well one of the element that prevents their adoption by users within the market and by
libraries for the public lending.

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13
            C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered22.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
      YES
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
An EU level registration system would ensure certainty of rights and hence incentivize the
legal use of the works. It would also make it easier to determine the exact duration of rights.
17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Like in the patent system, a registration system could impose costs on authors to get adequate
protection: hence, discouraging creativity. One should make sure on the one side that the
registration costs would be affordable to every kind of author. On the other side, the
introduction of such a system should not change the fact that copyright protection arises in the
very moment of creation/fixation of the work and it is not conditioned to the grant of the title
by an administrative office.

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

            D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed23, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database24 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition25 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub26 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

            E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention27 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X    NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Length of protection should be sensibly shortened for all kinds of works, especially
technological creations such as software, and for all kinds of rights (copyright and especially
neighbouring rights). Life plus seventy years from the authors’ death is an incredibly long
term of protection which is not necessary to spur creativity and development of science, and
the useful arts, especially in consideration of the rapid pace with which creative works are
disseminated through the digital market place.
Economic analysis supports the idea that current copyright terms, both in Europe and in the
US, are excessively long (see for example the standard analysis of Landes and Posner, The
Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law, Harvard University Press, 2003 in chapter 8
or the economic approach of M. Boldrin & D. Levine, Market Size and Intellectual Property
Protection, International Economic Review, Vol. 50, Issue 3, pp. 855-881 (August 2009)).

     II.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC28.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law29. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)30, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional31, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")32.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

32
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            17
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
       YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The framework of the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC significantly impairs free
access faculties (such as those relating to scientific research and teaching and, more broadly,
uses set forth in the public interests), as well as harmonization and legal certainty within the
EU. This is not only because the list of exception is optional to implement for Member States,
but also because the Directive provides for a list of exceptions and limitations which has an
exhaustive character and, in addition, it allows Member States to redefine restrictively the
scope of said exceptions or limitations (see, for example, Recital 36 allowing Member States
to introduce a form of fair compensation for right holders also when applying the optional
provisions on exceptions or limitations which do not require such compensation) (in this sense
see G. Ghidini, Innovation, Competition and Consumer Welfare in Intellectual Property Law,
Edward Elgar, 2010, at pp. 110-118; G. Ghidini, Exclusion and Access in Copyright Law: The
unbalanced features of the InfoSoc Directive, in Methods and Perspectives in Intellectual
Property, ATRIP Intellectual Property Series, G. B. Dinwoodie (ed.), Edward Elgar
Publishing, 2013, 307, at p. 317).
A first example of the detrimental effects caused by the exception framework just outlined
above (containing a closed list of exceptions, optional to implement for Member States,
which can redefine restrictively the scope of said exceptions) can be found with regard to the
scientific research exception set forth by Article 5, paragraph 3, letter a), of the InfoSoc
Directive. According to this provision, “Member States may provide for exceptions or
limitations to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 in the following cases: (a) use for the
sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source,
including the author’s name, is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible and to the
extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved”.
Some Member States have narrow provisions relating to scientific research, limiting, for
example, the amount or portion of work that researchers can use to pursue said purposes
(notwithstanding such quantitative restriction is not provided by the InfoSoc Directive itself).
For example, this is the case of Italy or France, whose copyright laws only allows to use
“fragments or parts” of a work for scientific purpose (reference is made to, respectively,
Article 70 of the Italian Copyright Law − Law of April 22, 1941, No. 633 −, and Article
L122-5, paragraph 3, letter e), of the French Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle − Loi 92-597,
July 1, 1992, as amended by Law 2006-961, implementing the InfoSoc Directive) (see F. De
Santis, Verso una riforma del diritto d’autore. Libertà di ricerca e libera circolazione della
conoscenza, in Rivista di diritto industriale, 2/2013, 118, at pp. 122-131; E. Sbarbaro, Note
sulla disciplina delle libere utilizzazioni tra mondo analogico e mondo digitale, in DigItalia –
Rivista del Digitale Nei Beni Culturali, 1/2012, 23, at p. 28).




                                                                                               18
A second clear example of how the optional nature of exception can be detrimental to their
effectiveness is the case of the exceptions set for the cultural institutions. In Italy art 5(2)c of
Directive 2001/29 has not been implemented while art 5(3)n has. This determines a highly
fragmented context which will be even more complex when the mandatory exception
provided by art 6 of Directive 2012/28 on certain permitted uses of orphan works will be
implemented. Italian cultural institutions will be allowed to digitise works deemed orphan for
making available in the pursuit of the dissemination of the European cultural heritage, but not
to digitise in-copyright works for preserving that same cultural heritage.
It shall be also pointed out that, within the framework of the InfoSoc Directive, the room for
the exceptions and limitations could be potentially restricted by the application of the so-
called ‘three-step test’ provided by Article 5, paragraph 5, of the Directive, and by the
application of technological protection measures (TPMs). These two points will be further
examined infra under question n. 24 and n. 80.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
       YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
The provision of certain exceptions, particularly those reflecting fundamental rights and
freedoms, should be conceived as a mandatory task for Member States and should be made
immune from the special legal protection granted to TPMs. This is the case of the exceptions
relating to scientific research and other uses enabling the sharing and dissemination of
knowledge (including quotations for purposes such as criticism and review and use for news
reporting and press reviews) (M.L. Montagnani, Il diritto d’autore nell’era digitale. La
distribuzione online delle opera dell’ingegno, Giuffré 2012, chapter II, § 4) as well as
exceptions adopted to enable cultural institutions to perform their public mission.
Once these exceptions are made mandatory, a higher level of harmonisation should moreover
be achieved by introducing the principle of mutual recognition of exceptions as done in the
case of orphan works by Directive 2012/28 art 4.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
In the field of teaching and research, two other exceptions could be added. A first exception
would regard translations made within teaching or research, with non-commercial purposes. A
second crucial exception should regard those acts regarding the interactive transmission of
study material from teachers to students enrolled in a certain course, at least when made
within access-restricted communication platform. It should be made clear that the act of
uploading teaching materials (such as course-pack made by the teacher for a certain course)
onto online platform and its downloading from students it does not amount to a violation of
both making available right and reproduction right (on this point see infra the answer to
question 43).
Cultural institutions also deserve more room to perform their public-interest mission of
preserving and disseminating national and European cultural heritage as well as providing as
many services as possible to their subscribers in compliance with third parties’ rights. Hence,
the current EU exception regime should be enriched by providing them with the possibility to
offer access to their collections on-line, to enable e-landing and access to users with
disabilities.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
   YES – Please explain why
The catalogue of exceptions and limitations contained in the Information Society Directive
contains an exhaustive list of conduct whose implementation by Member States is optional.
To make thing worse, the implementation into national laws of the exceptions codified into
the Directive is further subjected by the application of the so-called ‘three-step test’ provided,
as corollary, by Article 5, paragraph 5, of the Directive.
The current exhaustive list, coupled with the way into which the ‘three-step test’ is interpreted
within Member States, shows how much more flexibility would be needed to frame an
exception regime capable of taking into account the multiple interests that underpins it.
As a matter of fact, three-step test was originally conceived by the Berne Convention (Article
9, paragraph 2) as a set of guiding principle for national Member States’ legislators in order to
define the conditions under which they could introduce or maintain certain free uses
(accordingly, the test was clearly addressed only to Member States). The same ratio can be
found in the TRIPs Agreement (Article 13) and in the WIPO Copyright Treaty (Article 10).
The framework of the Information Society Directive, however, is rather different from the two
international Conventions’ mentioned above. The EU legislators, indeed, took good care in
expressly framing, one by one, in an exhaustive list, what kinds of exceptions for the digital
market place could be adopted by national copyright law. Hence, there was no need for the
further insertion of the three step test, nor the role it had to play was clear.
In this nebulous scenario, several judicial authorities of Member States have been called to
“apply” the test and to check, case-by-case, whether an exception or limitation complies with
criteria established therein (“judicial applications” of the three-step test have been already
carried out in some Member States, namely by the French Court of Cassation, decision of
February 28, 2006, no. 549, and by the Court of Milan, decision of May 14, 2009, no. 8787).


                                                                                               20
Within this context, an exception or limitation, although provided by law, could be considered
at a later stage in contrast with one of the steps set out by the test, with the result that the user
will never be sure of the spaces of freedom reserved to it by law.
Besides the current state of the legal framework, there is another aspect to be considered:
nowadays technology plays a significant role in the way in which the exception beneficiaries
operate and whenever they are vested with a public-interest mission to pursue it (this is the
case for example of cultural institutions). At the same time technological development cannot
be foreseen and should not be framed within a set number of exempted activities as it is now
that an exhaustive list of exceptions is provided. Flexibility is needed then also in relation to

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]


The role of the three step test within the Information Society Directive could be reframed in
such a way to provide similar flexibilities to those granted by the fair use model in the USA.
In particular, the three step test could have a big role to play if: i) it would be reframed not as
closing clause but as first opening principle of art. 5; ii) as such, it should precedes a non-
exhaustive list of exceptions.
In this way, the three step test could work as general clause to be transposed into national
copyright laws in such a way to allow judges enough room of manoeuvre to shape new
exceptions.
At this regard, it is worth recalling the recent judgement of the Spanish Supreme Court in the
Google v. Megakini case (Spanish Supreme Court, April 3, 2012, Megakini.com v Google
Spain,     N.     172/2012.      The     text     of   the     judgment     is    available    at
http://pdfs.wke.es/8/6/1/5/pd0000078615.pdf (in Spanish language)) where the Court
suggested that the three step test must not only be interpreted “in negative” sense, as a further
constrain to the applicability of the strictly codified list of exceptions, but it has also to be
regarded as a “positive interpretative tool”, clarifying the common rationale behind the
exceptions: i.e. that they must represent acts which do not prejudice the legitimate interests of
right holders and do not damage the normal exploitation of the work. The Spanish Court

                                                                                                  21
suggested that the three step test should be used as a safety valve to balance copyright
holders’ interests with interests of the society at large in such a way to permit a compression
of the latter’s prerogatives whenever the use performed by unauthorized third parties is not
able to damage copyright holders’ economic interests when they strategically use their rights
to unjustifiably harm third parties (more broadly see, E. Arezzo, Copyright Enforcement on
the Internet in the European Union: Hyperlinks and Making Available Right, forthcoming
in Research Handbook on the Cross-Border Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights,
P. Torremans (ed.), 2014, Edward Elgar Publishing).
On the other hand, build-in flexibility in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision may
well complement listed exceptions and limitations, most importantly shielding individuals
from liability when using materials for fair and principally non-commercial uses. A fair-use
provision would mostly benefit the users of libraries and cultural institutions in general, but
also the institutions themselves in providing advice to their users as regards permitted uses.
A well-defined doctrine with explicit requirements (see for example section 107, title 17, U.S.
Code) would minimise the need of frequent judicial interpretation, although courts can
interpret in a case-by-case basis when needed.

[Open question]




                                                                                            22
            A. Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving33 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions34. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive35.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
This answer is framed within the Italian context, in the field of publicly accessible libraries,
and in relation to digital copies.
Bocconi University Library (BUL) does not make preservation copies as this is not allowed
under the Italian copyright framework that implements Directive 2001/29/EC but does not
introduce the optional exception of Article 5.2.c. Typically, BUL makes preservation copies,
even digital, merely for very old books and manuscripts, after having carried out an accurate
search to verify the public domain status of that work or identify the right holder for obtaining

the authorisation to the digital reproduction. Unfortunately, this search is truly burdensome
and at the moment not viable through a ‘one-stop shop’.
     NO
     NO OPINION


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

This sort of problems may be solved by simply enabling libraries to pursue their traditional
mission of preserving and archiving their own collections with any new helpful technology
and in relation to any material that is included in their collections.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
We do consider the need to amend the European regulation in respect of the acts of
reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums,
or by archives. In particular, the legislative solution should be:
firstly, making mandatory the exception under art 5(2)c so that the national implementation
of the Directive will be bound to insert it within the Italian copyright framework;
secondly, enlarging the scope of exception 5(2)c in order to allow all the convenient
preservation technologies, either existent or prospective ones;
thirdly, preventing that this mandatory exception may be subsequently overridden by any
contractual means, such as the licenses between right holders and libraries.

31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Since the parties involved in the debate are not on the same footing, especially as to the scarce
ability of libraries to exert effective influence over right holders, the legislative solution is the
only suitable answer to the above mentioned problems.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to


                                                                                                  24
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
This question is provided in relation to the Italian context, and refers to the experience of a
publicly accessible library as Bocconi University Library (BUL) is.
BUL has frequently encountered problems with both standard licenses and negotiated
contracts. In both cases the main issue is that agreements limit the number of users that have
simultaneous access to collections, limit the location for access to on-site premises,
discriminate the categories of users (for example Bocconi faculty vs non-Bocconi faculty),
impose severe time-windows between printed and electronic versions as well as deny access
to entire parts of collection as occurs, for instance, by not including the most recent journal
issues within the accessible database (see M. Santarsiero, Come e quanto si pagano i diritti.
Licenze e reading lists: Il caso della Biblioteca dell’Università di Milano, in Biblioteche oggi,
6, 2008, at pp. 11-16).

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
By adding to the on-site terminal exception also the ability to offer off-site access to library’s
collection. Indeed, for accomplishing to its function, BUL’s materials should be accessible for
private study purposes also off-premises. It worth pointing out that any further agreement
between right holder and institutional user shall not override such proposed statutory right to
provide off-premises access (A. Vaglio, Document supply and Electronic Course Reserves.
Two services, one pattern, Paper presented at the 75th IFLA General Conference and
Assembly, Milan, August 23-27, 2009, available at http://conference.ifla.org/past/2009/143-
vaglio-en.pdf, last visited February, 2nd, 2014).


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
Cultural institutions in general, and publicly accessible libraries in particular, deserve more
room to perform their public-interest mission of preserving and disseminating their catalogue
as well as providing as many services as possible to their users in compliance with third
parties’ rights. While considering that any defence for the reproduction of a copyrighted work
shall not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and shall not unreasonably prejudice
the legitimate interests of the author, we recommend a legislative solution allowing cultural
institutions to digitize and offer access to their catalogue not only on-site but also on remote.

                                                                                               25
The regulation of these activities and their legal boundaries cannot be left to private ordering
mechanisms and, hence, cultural institutions would need a general exception that make
possible online viewing. Since not enabling any downloading, this exception would not be
detrimental to right holders’ rights and might represent a balanced solution between authors’
right and cultural institutions’ mission.

35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
      YES – Please explain with specific examples
Again, agreements between libraries, considering once again the view of Bocconi University
Library (BUL), and publishers are able to prevent the former from implementing its
institutional lending policy by permitting the latters to impose a divergent lending approach.
Namely, BUL reports that simultaneous loans to different users are limited, the overall
number of loans that BUL can provide to its users is also limited by contract, the lending
period is usually predefined by right holders, and inter-lending service is not allowed.
Moreover, the lack of interoperability between formats and platforms is also identified as a
major obstacle to access.
     NO
     NO OPINION

37.   If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]




                                                                                             26
We are of the view that greater interconnectedness, easier communication, and the exposure
of information offered by the digital technology turn void when libraries are prevented from
unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources. More precisely, e-
lending should enable the access to large amounts of information with a variety of digital
tools and, in any case, not smaller than those provided by physical lending.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

Institutional policies can be implemented on physical collections but are not possible on
online collections because of the contractual restraints deriving from the above mentioned
agreements.
Libraries have the availability of physical collections as a result of a purchase, while, in the
case of online collections, the availability is subject to agreements with right holders.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
There is no dogmatic difference between libraries’ traditional public lending activities and
activities such as off-premises consultation and e-lending. Deeming traditional library
activities and new digitally enabled services conceptually different would impede libraries’
adaptation to the digital era.
From a legal perspective, the central question is whether e-lending by public libraries is
covered by the existing public lending rights regimes of national legislations under the
European copyright framework.

At the moment copyright law explicitly only grants exhaustion to tangible objects, such as
printed books. However, to enable libraries to perform their public interest mission effectively
also in the digital era, there is a need of a clear legal basis for library e-lending. In all, the
sticking contradiction to the right holders’ legal rights regarding a print book renders the need
for clarity in the regulatory framework for e-lending pressing (see H. Müller, Legal aspects of
e-books and interlibrary loan, Interlending & Document Supply 40/3, 2012, at pp. 150-155,
available at http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047187 and A. Reese,
The first sale doctrine in the era of digital networks, Boston College Law Review, 44, 2003,
at 577 ss.). The problem with e-lending today is that the major publishers, contractually
superior to small but also larger libraries with serious budget limitations, are now establishing
contractual conditions that exceed the monopoly afforded by copyright. The increased cost for
online versions of works is a burden that we cannot just assume that libraries, will simply
adapt to.

Given the lack of clear regulatory framework covering e-lending, libraries that wish to offer to
their users e-books available for lending are currently facing several licensing practices and

                                                                                               27
models offered by publishers or right holders (contractual restrains discussed in above
questions – for the dominant licensing practices see also D. O’Brien, U. Gasser, J. Palfrey, E-
Books in Libraries: A Briefing Document Developed in Preparation for a Workshop on E-
Lending in Libraries, Berkman Center Research Publication No. 2012-15, available at
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111396##). Without the limitations that
the exhaustion doctrine places on the copyright monopoly of the right holders, distribution of
digital works, as currently takes place under private contracts, circumvents the rationale
behind copyright and perhaps promotes rent-seeking practices (see O. Fischman Afori, The
Battle over Public e-Libraries – Tacking Stock and Moving Ahead, IIC, 44, 2013, at pp. 392-
417).



4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other36. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)37.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X    YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
A legislative solution to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU are effectively implemented
in Italy is needed.

          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
37
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             28
Among the main problems that such legislation must address there are the costly rights
clearance, the systematic funding of digitization, the dealing with out-of-distribution works
(including cross-border access). It should also provide solutions covering copyright issues in
all the different sectors (audio-visual, text, visual arts, sound), which have not, for example,
all been covered by the recent Orphan Works directive.
All the above are topics touched upon by the he 2011 Comité des Sages report on Bringing
Europe's                 Cultural                Heritage              Online              (see
http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/comite_des_sages/index_en
.htm), which explicitly recognises and, all the more stresses the importance of cultural
institutions trying to digitise as much of their holdings as possible.

               B. Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC38 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
      YES – Please explain


The Teaching exception provides another good example of the deleterious consequences
caused by the optional exceptions regime introduced by the Information Society Directive.
One of the consequences of the fact that the implementation of the exemption is not
mandatory and that Member States have been allowed to redefine restrictively the scope and
boundaries of said exceptions or limitations, is that certain countries, such as Italy (and
France), have limited the exemption to parts or extracts of the protected works, thus not
including the use of the whole work. As a matter of fact, Italian Copyright Legislation (Law
n. 633/1941) provides for such restriction in Art. 70, comma 1, and more precisely it provides
the limitation of freedom of summary, quoting, reproduction and communication to the public
for teaching purpose (and critical analysis, discussion, study and scientific research purposes)
to “fragments or parts” of works, thus making illegal the reproduction of the whole works
without the prior authorization of the right owner. Such provision makes the exemption
almost inapplicable in a real life scenario to works such as figurative and plastic art pieces and
brief textual works such as poems and short tales. Moreover, applying this exception to part of
works such as statues, paintings, photographs, math demonstrations and diagnostic theories
would be, most of the times, useless (see E. Sbarbaro, Note sulla disciplina delle libere
utilizzazioni tra mondo analogico e mondo digitale, in DigItalia – Rivista del Digitale Nei
Beni Culturali, 1/2012, 23, at p. 28) .
This puts the Italian teacher in an awkward position as he is forced to make an illegal use of
the works or, alternatively, to not use it, with an impoverishment of his teaching potential.
In addition, art. 70, 1°, of Italian Copyright Law, which implemented Art. 5, par. 3(a),
replaced the generic and more “open” wording of the Directive (“use for the sole purpose of
illustration for teaching or scientific research”) with the more restrictive provision envisaging
exemption for certain acts of reproduction and making available, conditioned to the “sole


38
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               30
purpose of illustration for teaching”, together with the non-commercial purpose and the non-
competitive nature of the use.
The “illustration for teaching” purpose limits the applicability of the exception to the
subjective-student and to the objective-specific lesson sphere; thus with the risk of ruling out
any wider but not strictly illustrative educational purpose, such as the sharing of study
material for distance learning purposes. This is also a consequence of the bad wording used
by both the EU and the national provisions. The word ‘illustration’ indeed leads one to think
that only the showing or using of material in class, during teaching, might be covered by the
exception, and not the further activities related to the circulation of study materials afterwards.
The situation is particularly deleterious in Italy where, although it is assumed that the generic
word “use”, as provided by Art. 5, par. 3(a) of the Directive should allow for the application
of the exemption by Member States both in the analogue and in the digital sphere, the
exemption for teaching purposes has been applied in a very restrictive way by Italian judges,
who deem it applicable only to the analogical context (i.e. Italian Supreme Court, see Corte di
Cassazione n. 2089/1997, in Il Diritto Industriale, 1997, p. 812) and rule out the chance of
exempting any digital use on communication networks for illustration purposes. Moreover,
Italy is neither succeeding in having recourse to individual or collective licensing or
agreements in regards to the use of protected works on online platforms.
As a consequence, any likely making available of protected works by teachers for illustration
purposes is deemed illegal: to the detriment of both teachers and students. Other Member
States, on the other hand, adopted solutions based either on collective agreements/licences
between organizations representative of the parties’ interests, and on legal licences providing
for fair compensation, though different from each other, for instance by means of the
subjective application field. Lastly, it must be pointed out that Italian law embraces another
bold, inaccurate and incomplete provision on educational use which gave rise to a harsh
debate. It is Art. 70, comma 1bis, of Italian Copyright Law (introduced by Art. 2 of Law 9
January 2008, n. 2) which is in fact a “dead letter”: “Publication through the internet of free of
charge low resolution or tainted images and music is allowed, for educational or scientific
purposes and only in such a way that the use is not profit-making. A decree by the Italian
Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, in agreement with the Ministry of Public
Education and the Ministry of University and Research, and following the opinion of the
related Parliament Commissions, defines the limitations for educational and scientific use as
provided for by this comma”. The regulation which should have defined the subjective and
objective limitations of the exemption has never been issued.

See under 42.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
The teaching exception should be amended in such a way:
      i)        to grant the proper degree of flexibility needed to adapt to the evolving and
                changing teaching methodologies and technologies;
      ii)       to introduce subjective limitations: i.e. defining the categories benefiting from the
                exception, such as Private and Public Schools, Universities and Research
                Institutions recognised by Member States’ legal systems, teachers, students. For
                example, only teachers should be allowed to make the works available on the
                platforms, while students should be permitted to freely visualizing on their
                browser and downloading. The material made available for students should only
                be shareable between students attending the same course or University, while it
                should be prohibited for them to further share such material with other third parties
                (for example through the use of publicly accessible social platform).
      iii)      To introduce objective limitations: i.e. exempting the above defined acts only
                when they take place within a restricted-access platform.
      iv)       To drawing a line between on the one hand authorization-exempted free uses and
                on the other hand uses requiring a compensation (or a collective or individual
                authorization by the rightholders), on the ground of the subject, the space, the
                amount, the time of use (for instance depending on how wide the student network
                is: limited access through password to the students of a specific course or to the
                students of the all Institute/University, access limited to a certain number of
                students for the use not to be “public”, etc.).
      v)        To introducing a specific provision for the “study at home” of people with a
                disability.
Such exception or limitation should be mandatory for Member States in order to guarantee a
limited degree of certainty of rights and facilitate the across border use of protected works for
educational purposes.

               C. Research
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
      YES – Please explain
As a consequence of the exception framework set forth by the InfoSoc Directive (see on this
topic answer no. 21 above), several Member States have limited the portion of work that can
be used for research purposes. This is the case of the Italian Copyright Law (Law of April 22,
1941, No. 633), whose Article 70 only allows to use “fragments or parts” of a protected work
for scientific purposes, provided that other conditions are met (e.g. there is no commercial
purpose); likewise, the French Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle only allows the use of
“extraits d’oeuvres” (Article L122-5, paragraph 3, letter e), of Loi 92-597, July 1, 1992, as
amended by Law 2006-961, implementing the InfoSoc Directive).
On the contrary, some Member States have implemented almost literally the research
exception provided by the InfoSoc Directive (this is the case of Malta − Copyright Act of
Malta, Chapter 415 of the Laws of Malta, ACT XIII of 2000, as amended by Acts VI of 2001
and IX of 2003 − and Cyprus − Law no. 128(I)/2004), and therefore in said countries no
limits as to the portion of the work to be used are set by the respective copyright laws. In this
respect, it is worth noting that neither the InfoSoc Directive (Article 5, paragraph 3, letter a))
nor the Berne Convention (in particular, Article 10, paragraph 2, which relates to illustrations
for teaching) provide restrictions as to the portion of work that can be used. The quantitative
restriction mentioned above raises some criticalities and could substantially obstacle the
research activity of researches (e.g., to discuss a scientific theorem or to verify a medical
theory it would only be possible to use extracts and fragments of works. The use of the entire
work would be prevented under the current national legal framework of the countries
providing said quantitative restriction) (see G. Ghidini, L. B. Moraia, P. Errico, Il diritto
d’autore nell’economia della conoscenza: le eccezioni al diritto d’autore a scopo di ricerca,
Progetto CRUI-SIAE-AIE, 2011, http://dirittoautore.cab.unipd.it/convegno, at p. 4). Also,
where the aforementioned quantitative limit exists, there are no criteria to establish what is a
“portion” of work under the permitted use (how many pages? Who establish what is a
portion?).
In addition, Article 5, paragraph 3, letter a), of the InfoSoc Directive has been implemented in
some Member States as an exemption, while in other States the use of works for research
purposes is subject to the payment of a fair compensation to the rights holders. This is in line
with the InfoSoc Directive, whose Recital 36 provides that “The Member States may provide
for fair compensation for right holders also when applying the optional provisions on
exceptions or limitations which do not require such compensation”. Along this line, the

39
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               33
exception pédagogique et de recherché provided by Article L122-5, paragraph 3, letter e), of
the French Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle requires a fair compensation to be paid to right
holders.
The differences in the implementation of the research exception among Member States across
the EU makes it difficult to draw the line between what is permissible and what is not. And
this is particularly relevant when research activities are carried out within a transnational
framework. Let’s think to researchers who wish to carry out their activities in several
institutions located in different countries. The same activities could be lawful or unlawful
depending on the country and on the relevant legal framework (see F. De Santis, Verso una
riforma del diritto d’autore. Libertà di ricerca e libera circolazione della conoscenza, Rivista
di diritto industriale, 2/2013, 118, at pp. 122-131).
Further, the InfoSoc Directive permits the research exception only if the scientific activity is
aimed at “non-commercial purposes”. This limit (which is not provided within the patent
framework – see Article 27, letter b), of the Community Patent Convention, December 30,
1989) excludes researchers who work in and for firms elaborating on the previous “state of
the art”. This provision does not seem to consider that, as long as there is no industrial or
commercial exploitation, no infringing activity should be assessed (in this sense G. Ghidini,
Exclusion and Access in Copyright Law: The unbalanced features of the InfoSoc Directive, in
Methods and Perspectives in Intellectual Property, ATRIP Intellectual Property Series, G.B.
Dinwoodie (ed.), Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013, 307, , at p. 324).
That “balance between the rights of authors and the larger public interest, particularly
education, research and access to information” which is underlined in the preamble of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty and is also references to in the InfoSoc Directive (Recital 31) seems
not to be achieved in the existing legal framework, notwithstanding that research activities are
grounded on constitutional basis and are expression of fundamental rights (recognized both
by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which became legally binding
on the EU with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in December 2009, and by
national constitutional systems − in Italy, see Article 33 of the Italian Constitution, which
states that art and science are free, and teaching them shall be free as well, and Article 9 of the
Italian Constitution, which states that the Italian Republic promotes scientific and technical
research)

  NO OPINION


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The provision of the research exemption should be conceived as a mandatory task for
Member States and should also be made immune towards TPMs.
Under this perspective, research uses should be reformulated in precise and strict terms in
such a way as to leave no room for any interpretation of national legislators. In this way, there
might be the chance to achieve a greater level of harmonization across the European Union
and to enhance research activities carried out within a transnational framework.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?


                                                                                                34
[Open question]
To facilitate the use of content for research purposes open access initiatives have been
launched in Member States. Open access, whilst promoting open access to research
productions in the digital environment, aims to encourage researchers to disseminate their
work and make it freely available on the web for the whole public. These goals have been
expressed in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, published on February 14, 2002, promoted
by the Open Access Institute (available at http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read),
and in the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities,
published on October 22, 2003 (available at http://openaccess.mpg.de/286432/Berlin-
Declaration).
According to the signatories of the mentioned Berlin Declaration, new possibilities of
knowledge dissemination not only through the classical form but also and increasingly
through the open access paradigm via the Internet have to be supported. To this aim, it has
been highlighted that the web has to be sustainable, interactive, and transparent, and content
and software tools must be openly accessible and compatible. Open access contributions must
satisfy two conditions: (i) the author(s) and right holder(s) of such contributions grant(s) to all
users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute,
transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any
digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship, as
well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal use; (ii) a
complete version of the work is published in at least one online research repository (as
clarified also in the European Research Council’s Scientific Council Guidelines for Open
Access            of         December            17,          2007           (available          at
http://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_scc_guidelines_open_access.pdf).
However, as clarified also in the Max Plank Institute’s comments to the public consultation on
the Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy (available at the following link:
http://www.ip.mpg.de/files/pdf1/Comments-GreenPaperCopyrigthKnowledgeEconomy4.pdf),
although several open access publishers have launched successful publications and high-end
databases, forcing scholarly authors to open access publishing has not yet proved yet to be
superior in providing sustainable and cost-effective platforms for disseminating scientific
information and knowledge. In particular, it has been highlighted that “Open access mandates
for peer-reviewed publications arguably undermine reasonable investments of publishers, and
constitute a two-tier publication mode with ambiguous interdependencies. Besides the
economical and organizational uncertainties, from a legal perspective, it is still unclear
whether mandates such as those adopted by the European Research Council comply with the
fundamental freedom of scientific research as is found in the respective constitutions of
several Member States. Whereas this seems desirable, it is also not sufficiently clear how the
established mechanisms of building reputation within the scientific community will adapt to
these new publication models, which seems crucial for their success”.

               D. Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC40 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with



40
     Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                35
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 41.

The Marrakesh Treaty42 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
      YES – Please explain by giving examples
As publicly accessible library, Bocconi University Library (BUL) must make available books
and articles also to users with visual disabilities. Technology helps, providing digital texts.
But unfortunately, publishers, especially in the Italian context, do not supply pdf files of their
books. Sometimes they do not even hold them, sometimes they are not ready to send them to
libraries. They consider libraries unreliable interlocutors. Besides, the most of Electronic
Resources (supplied by International Academic Publishers) are still not readable by specific
software for visually impaired people.
     NO
     NO OPINION


51.       If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
To make publicly accessible libraries perform their duty to make content accessible to users
with disabilities, it should made clear that publishers have provide formats that can be
reproduced in order to meet these specific needs by all cultural institutions. The key issue,
though, is ex ante in the availability of the content to be then reproduced and adapted for users
with disabilities, and not in the technology to do this which is much more easier to be found.

            E. Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics43 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”44. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Under current copyright regulation, text and data mining are not likely to be permitted in
Europe (P. Ganley, Google Book Search: Fair use, Fair dealing and the Case of Intermediary
Copying,             Working               paper,           2006,          available         at
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=875384) and they have diffusely been
found infringing in France (Editions du Seuil et autres c Google Inc et France, Tribunal de
grande instance de paris 3ème chamber, 2ème section Jugement du 18 dècembre 2009)
because, under European jurisdiction, unauthorized reproduction of the whole work has no
broad defense comparable to that of US fair use.
In the UK, it is disputed whether non-commercial text mining is already permissible as a fair
dealing by virtue of sec. 29 of the CDPA 1988. In any event non-display uses are often
excluded by contract, and the problem with sec. 29 is that it is not mandatory against its
contractual restriction.
Moreover, any defense for non-display uses of copyright works limited to non-commercial
research would not be capable of delivering all the intended benefits of text mining (JISC, The
Value and Benefit of Text Mining to UK Further and Higher Education, Digital Infrastructure,
2012, available at: http://bit.ly/jisc-textm). Since permitting commercial text mining may have
substantial public benefits and positive impact on growth and innovation, there is the need of
supportive solutions for commercial research as well.


                                                                                            38
56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
We, therefore, recommend that an exception on text and data mining for non-commercial
research should be put in place and rendered mandatory against any contractual restriction.

We also recommend that the text and data mining defense should not be limited to non-
commercial uses. We are of the view that an exception extended to commercial research
would better support the potential of text mining technologies. In this case permission could
have to be under a fair remuneration scheme.
Alternatively, if commercial text mining is found to go against the second step of the three-
step test (article 5(5) of the European Copyright Directive), under which a permitted activity
should not conflict with the normal exploitation of a work, the permission for commercial
research should have to be under a compulsory licensing scheme.


21.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

            F. User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs45. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded

45
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           39
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions46.

22.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
Internet users generate a continuous flow of content that is uploaded on various platform,
from those for general networking to those for networking among specific group such as
academics. Within this plethora of content mash-ups only represent a portion of the content
made available although they raise the question as to whether this activity is actually
infringing third parties’ copyright.
As internet users approach the world of UGC change from persons to person in relation to
their knowledge of copyright law and its ‘all rights reserved’ default rule. Users that have
knowledge of copyright rules encounter a first obstacle when they want to make their own
content available to others for the creation of further works or for re-use. In order to enable
the sharing users/authors must specify what licence is adopted for that content – i.e. what
rights are reversed and what are licensed – otherwise the default ‘all rights reserved’
copyright regime applies.
On the other hand users that want to reuse material available online or incorporate it in their
own works encounter the significant obstacle of understanding the copyright regime under
which that material released. In this context creative commons licenses work quite well and
are widely adopted by the users that want to open up their content as well as by those that
want derive from online works in compliance to copyright rules. Moreover, these open
licences show that at least online there is the need for a rule different form the default
copyright rule (M. Ricolfi, Making Copyright Fit for the Digital Agenda, 2011, available at
http://nexa.polito.it/nexafiles/Making%20Copyright%20Fit%20for%20the%20Digital%20Ag
enda.pdf). A rule that enables the appropriation of the content without aggravating the authors
with the duty of always adding the right licence (and linked metadata) in order to share their
creation.
Many users though are not aware enough of copyright licensing mechanisms or if aware
prefer to operate in a grey areas within which certain behaviours are tolerated insofar they are
not sanctioned by law. The existence of such a grey area does not seem to provide incentives
to creativity and innovation, nor to dissemination of new content online (M.L. Montagnani, A
New Interface between Copyright Law and Technology: How User-Generated Content will
Shape the Future of Online Distribution, in 26 Cardozo Arts & Entertainment, 2009, at p.

   YES – Please explain
Proprietary systems cannot be considered sufficient to ensure that works created by users are
properly identified for online uses as they are not meant to do that. Proprietary systems can
work in the off-line world where in the majority of cases they make possible to identify the
right holder and ask for the authorization that will enable a third party to use the pre-existing
work. In the online realm this system is altered by the facility to which works can be found
and used by third parties that are often unaware that a work is copyrighted, hence unavailable
for any use without prior authorization. Moreover, even when users were aware of how
proprietary systems rule the appropriation of content online and the dissemination of new
content, they would ignore that such rules can vary from country to country. If this is the
context, it becomes clear that the current proprietary copyright is not fit for the online
environment and need to be adapted to the UGC phenomenon.

25.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The best solution would be the adoption of a legislative solution to the phenomenon of UGC.
Some countries are actually facing the issue in relation to mash-ups but this is not enough as it
ought to be addressed considering the whole phenomenon of UGC that span from authorial
content to derivative works.


26.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
A first exception within copyright law should be included so to authorize the use of an
existing work or other subject-matter, which has been made available to the public, in the
creation of a new work, provided that the use of the new work or other subject-matter is done
primarily for non-commercial purposes, and the source of the existing work or other subject-
matter is mentioned, if it is reasonable to do so. The primary non-commercial nature of such
UGC indicates that they should not have a substantial adverse effect on the exploitation or
potential exploitation of the existing work or other subject-matter they derive from. As a
matter of fact UGC, even when born with an amateur intent, can indirectly become a source
of revenue, as in the case that they are made available on platform that monetize, through the
sale of advertising spaces, the number of visualizations. When this happens the question as to
whether the UGC would fall outside the scope of the exception above proposed should find an
answer by considering the substantial adverse effect that the UGC constitute for the
exploitation of the work or subject matter that it incorporates. Once there is not such
substantial adverse effect the UGC should still beneficiate of the copyright exception.

27.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

 III.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying47. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4849.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

28.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments53.

     IV.       Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers54 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract55. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     V.     Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE56 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text57. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose58. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure59. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

39.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
Any discussion about strengthening civil enforcement system shall take into account the need
to distinguish between online activities which are clear infringement of copyright, carried out
with intention of commercial benefit, and activities which are aimed at sharing contents and
ideas with other users with a view to enjoying and commenting existing works with no
lucrative purposes, and which are expression of fundamental rights of Internet users (e.g.
freedom of expression). While the former should be pursued more efficiently, the latter should
find their room within the current copyright law framework. In recent years right holders (e.g.
music or movie majors) have taken several legal actions against both individuals and Internet
Service Providers using or offering file sharing services with various purposes (e.g. A&M
Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 239 F.3d 1004
(2001); MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. (US Supreme Court, 545 U.S. 913, 2005); Pirate
Bay (Stockholm District Court, 2009, B 13301-06); etc.). However, copyright enforcement
actions seems not to take properly into account that file sharing services can be used also to
foster freedom of expression and exchange information useful to express people’s opinions, to
comment (including parodying), to carry out derivative works, with no commercial
purposes.For example, in OPG v. Diebold a California district court held that Diebold, Inc., a
manufacturer of electronic voting machines, knowingly misrepresented that online
commentators including IndyMedia and two Swarthmore college students had infringed the
company’s copyright (337 F. Supp. 2nd 1195, N.D. California, 2004). In 2003 Diebold
starting sending cease-and-desist letters to US university students who engaged in circulating

56
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
57
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
58
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
59
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           48
on the Internet, via file-sharing networks, Diebold’s internal communications revealing flaws
in Diebold’s e-voting machines. Letters were sent also to ISPs hosting said documents. The
company claimed copyright infringement and, pursuant to the DMCA, requested to take down
the documents. Online Policy Group (OPG), a non-profit ISP, refused to remove the files in
the name of free speech. Two students and OPG sued Diebold alleging that Diebold
knowingly materially misrepresented that the students and ISP had infringed Diebold’s
copyright. In his decision Judge Jeremy Fogel wrote that “No reasonable copyright holder
could have believed that the portions of the email archive discussing possible technical
problems with Diebold’s voting machines were protected by copyright.”
The right holders’ strategy to pursue copyright infringements online indiscriminately has
revealed unsuccessful, a new line of action is then needed which rethinks copyright rules in
order to enlarge the scope of lawful activities online (see above II) and to concentrate the
legal actions on truly infringing organized activities.

40.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The current legal framework on intermediaries’ liability for copyright infringement online is
the result, on the one hand, of the need to shield them from liabilities for unlawful activities
occurring online (via the so-called safe harbours), and, on the other hand, of the right holders’
attempt to limit the scope of such safe harbours when they cannot enforce their rights directly
against infringing users. However, given the unsuccessful story of copyright enforcement
online (as above mentioned), right holders are trying to demand an increasing involvement of
intermediaries not only in the removal of infringing activities’ effects but also in their
prevention. The scenario of remedies requested by the right holders go from the known Notice
& Take Down (in EU ‘Notice & Action’) to the Notice & Disconnect (N&D), adopted in
France as a typical example of ‘graduated response’, to the ‘blocking’ of websites that host
copyright material without authorization (as endorsed by Turkey since 2004 and, later on, by
Spain through the ley Sinde of 2011), to the ‘filtering’, i.e. the monitoring of transient
electronic communications in order to prevent unauthorized distribution of copyright works,
with a crescendo of invasion into the users’ private sphere.
If a clarification of the legal framework in terms of legal remedies is needed, it should not
however revolve around the intermediaries’ roles as ‘gatekeeper’ of the Web, rather it should
consider their function as potential nurturers of online activities (P. Dubini, M.L. Montagnani,
The economic value of internet in cultural industries, Executive Summer, ASK Research
Center, 2012, http://www.ask.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/888ed0e2-a06c-4db7-8863-

This can be done only by focusing on the rules that are at the core of cultural industries, i.e.
copyright law, so to adapt them to the ongoing market and technological changes. The call for
‘modernizing copyright’ does not simply refers then to a propitious chance to be taken, but
rather to the concrete need for a fair balance that all the interests involved into the online
activities convey (A. Bertoni, M.L. Montagnani, Il ruolo degli intermediary internet tra tutela
del diritto d’autore e valorizzazione della creatività in rete, in XL Giurisprudenza
commerciale, 2013, 537). In order to build a fully-ﬂedged digital economy, as well as a
complete digital single market within the EU, fundamental principles come into play and their
concurrent accomplishment entails an overall equilibrium in which copyright law should act
as means to the end of economic, social and cultural enhancement. It is within such a vision
that the role of Internet intermediaries should be thought, not just in the pursue of copyright
infringements.

41.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain

   NO – Please explain

Recent legislative proposals to strengthen online copyright enforcement have been much
controversial, mainly because of lack of transparency in their development and criticalities
about their potential impact on fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and the
right to privacy. In particular, said initiatives do not seem to ensure a right balance between
protection of IP rights and data protection.
For example, within the heated discussions about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
(ACTA) (then rejected by the European Parliament in July 2012), the European Data
Protection Supervisor (EDPS) warned about the negative impact of the ACTA on data
protection rights and potential lack of due process and judicial protection of certain
provisions, notably the provisions that would have allowed copyright holders, or entrusted
third parties, to monitor Internet users and identify alleged copyright infringers.
In an Opinion issued in February 2010 (on the current negotiations by the European Union of
an Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, OJ C 147, 5.6.2010, p. 1), the EDPS concluded that
the introduction in ACTA of a measure that would involve the massive surveillance of
Internet users would be contrary to EU fundamental rights, notably with the rights to privacy
and data protection, which are protected under Article 8 of the European Convention on
Human Rights and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and
could also damage freedom of speech.
The same need for a proper balancing between protection of third parties’ IP rights and
internet users’ fundamental rights emerges constantly even in the European Court of Justice
case law. For example, in Promusicae (Decision of January 29, 2008, case C-275/06,
Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) vs. Telefónica de España SAU), the
European Court of Justice held that a fair balance has to be struck between the various
fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and that the EU directives must
be interpreted in such a way that they are not in conflict with general principles of
Community law, such as the principle of proportionality. The same need to struck a balance

                                                                                             50
between property rights, including IP rights, and other fundamental rights (such as the
freedom to carry out business, freedom of expression, criticism, discussions and the right to
privacy) has been highlighted also in the European Court of Justice’s decisions in SABAM
(decision of November 24, 2011, Scarlet Extended SA v Societé Belge des Auteurs,
Compositeurs et Editeurs SCRL (SABAM), C-70/10) and Netlog (decision of February 16,
2012, Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten en Uitgevers CVBA (SABAM) vs.
Netlog NV, C-360/10) cases.
In particular, the reasoning of the Court in SABAM is very significant. On one hand, it
recognized that the protection of copyright amounts to a fundamental right granted by Article
17, paragraph 2. of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. On the other
side, the Court noted that such a right is not granted with an absolute protection. As the Court
had already established in Promusicae, IP rights must be balanced with other fundamental
rights, such as ISPs’ freedom to carry out their business, that is in turn protected under Article
16 of the EU Charter. The Court found that the installation of a filtering system with the same
characteristics as that ordered by the Belgian court in the case at issue would have infringed
the freedom of ISPs concerned to conduct business. Such a system was in breach of Article 3
of the Enforcement Directive 2004/48/CE, that permits the adoption of measures intended to
protect intellectual property rights provided that they are not unnecessarily complicated or
costly. At the same time filtering and blocking systems imposed to Scarlet in the case at hand
would also affect the fundamental rights of Scarlet’s customers, namely their right to
protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information, (protected
respectively by Article 8 and Article 10 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights) insofar as
said system, on one side, involved the processing of IP addresses that may allow to identify
users and therefore are personal data, on the other, could determine the filtering or blocking of
lawful communications, as it was not properly designed to distinguish between lawful and
unlawful contents.
Recently, the General Advocate of the European Court of Justice (in his conclusion in UPC
Telekabel Wien GmbH v Constantin Film Verleih GmbH und Wega
Filmproduktionsgesellschaft GmbH, issued on November 26, 2013, Case C-314/12) also
clarified that, according to existing laws, an internet provider can be required to block access
by its customers to a website which infringes copyright. However, such a court injunction
must refer to specific blocking measures and achieve an appropriate balance between the
opposing interests which are protected by fundamental rights.
Any measure aimed at strengthening the enforcement of IP rights must not come at the
expense of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals to privacy and freedom of
expression, and other rights such as presumption of innocence and effective judicial
protection. A multi-stakeholder approach should be adopted, and the process of making and
implementing measures on copyright enforcement should not be made on the basis of
influence of private and economic interests to the detriment of the public interest.

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

42.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
► NO OPINION


43.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?

VII.      Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

44.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.

Another important subject matter for a review of European digital age copyright rules
concerns the relation between Technological Protection Measures (TPMs), right of access
to works not protected by copyright, and the application of the exceptions and limitations to
copyright and related rights.
Differently from what is provided for the exceptions and limitations (Art. 5), Directive, Art. 6,
requires as mandatory (“shall”) the legal protection of the TPMs by Member States’ legal
systems (in this sense see G. Ghidini, Innovation, Competition and Consumer Welfare in
Intellectual Property Law, Edward Elgar, 2010, at pp. 110-118).
A critical analysis arises from an in-depth assessment of the provisions contained in Art. 6.
1) First of all, in introducing a specific legal protection against the mere act of circumventing
a technological protection measures, regardless of whether the protected work has been
actually infringed, nor of whether the protection measure is indeed attached to a protected
work, the Directive seems to codify some sort of “access right”, with the risk of allowing the
owner to control every use of the purchased work (!) See E. Arezzo, Videogames and
consoles Between Copyright and Technical Protection Measures, in 40 IIC 2009, 82, at 95.
In doing so, the Directive seems to absolutely disregard the relevant international Treaties
where it is established that measures may be applied by copyright owners «in connection»
with the exercise of rights arising from the Bern Convention or the WIPO Treaty (see art. 11
of the WTC Treaty: «Contracting Parties shall provide adequate legal protection and effective
legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by
authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne
Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the
authors concerned or permitted by law»). At this regard see E. AREZZO, Technological
Measures, Software and Interoperability in the Digital Age, in Intellectual Property and
Market Power, G. Ghidini and M. Genovesi (eds.), 2007, 449, at 451.
The negative effects of the fusion between anti-copy and anti-access measures on the free
circulation of ideas and information are undeniable.
As a matter of fact, the protection of technological measures “per se” provides for the
prevention of uses normally authorized by copyright law, allowing the rightholders to “block
the access” even of works not protected by copyright or even non protectable. That is the case
for all works in the public domain, for works not satisfying the requirement of “originality”
because lacking of creativity, and for those parts of works representing the “idea” and not the

                                                                                                53
protected “expressive form”, in such a way that the provision goes against a fundamental
principle of copyright law (also ratified by the TRIPs) (See G. Ghidini, Innovation,
Competition and Consumer Welfare in Intellectual Property Law, Edward Elgar, 2010, at
114 and ff.; G. Ghidini, Exclusion and Access in Copyright Law: The unbalanced features of
the InfoSoc Directive, in Methods and Perspectives in Intellectual Property, ATRIP
Intellectual Property Series, G.B. Dinwoodie (ed.), 2013, Edward Elgar Publishing, 307, at p.
320 and ff.; E. Arezzo, Misure tecnologiche di protezione, software e interoperabilità nell’era
digitale, in Il Diritto di Autore, 3/2008, 340, at p. 345; E. Sbarbaro, Note sulla disciplina delle
libere utilizzazioni tra mondo analogico e mondo digitale, in DigItalia – Rivista del Digitale
Nei Beni Culturali, 1/2012, 23, at 32).
2) Secondly, the legislation on MTPs limits the traditional exceptions and limitations to
copyright, including the reproduction for private use, for digital works and especially for
online works, in a very narrow way.
Art. 6, par. 4, of the Directive envisages an obligations upon right-holders to provide the
necessary means in order to allow beneficiaries of the exception to actually take advantage of
it. However, such a duty -- which should shift upon Member States, should right holders
remain inert – is not established for all exceptions and limitations, but only for those
contained in either art. 5 par. 2 lett. a), c), d), e), or art. 5 par. 3 lett. a), b) o e), and only if
provided by the National legal system.
Now, besides the circumstance that it is not clear from the text of the Directive who should be
in charge of monitoring whether right holders comply in a satisfactory way with such
obligation (in such a way to urge Member States legislators to take action, if needed), the
problem is, however, how beneficiaries of the exception “prevented” by the technological
blockage can uphold their rights in a real life scenario. The enforcement of this provision is
very difficult especially in countries, like Italy, where the judicial application of copyright is
very protective of the rightholders’ prerogatives (see Court of Milan, decision of May 14,
2009, n. 8787). More extensively see E. AREZZO, Technological Measures, Software and
Interoperability in the Digital Age, in Intellectual Property and Market Power, G. Ghidini
and M. Genovesi (eds.), 2007, 449, at 453 and ff.
3) Last but not least, the Directive establishes (art. 6.4.4.) that for those works and protected
materials «made available to the public on agreed contractual terms in such a way that
members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them», the penultimate section of par. 4 does not apply: therefore, there is no obligation to
force the right owners to act in such a way to put users in condition to actually benefit from
the exceptions, even though they are allowed by their National laws.


In conclusion, a clear lack of balance exists between the protection of the analogue and the
digital worlds: while in the first one consumers can take advantage of the exceptions and
limitations provided by their National laws, in the second one the only “guaranteed”
exceptions (only if provided for by National laws) are those specifically listed in Article 6,
par. 4. Furthermore, if protected works are made available in such a way that the public may
access at a time and from a place individually chosen by them, there is no guarantee that users
will be allowed to benefit from any exceptions or limitations granted into the analogue world
(see E. Arezzo, Misure tecnologiche di protezione, software e interoperabilità nell’era
digitale, in Il Diritto di Autore, 3/2008, 340, at p. 357).
