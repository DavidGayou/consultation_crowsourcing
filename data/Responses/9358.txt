PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE REVIEW OF THE EU COPYRIGHT RULES
Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is the leading business organization in Finland. Our main task is to create an internationally attractive and competitive business environment for companies operating in Finland. 

We represent and defend the interests of the Finnish business community  -  both on the national level, as well as in the EU. We are engaged in dialogue and cooperation in all subjects relevant to our members such as intellectual property rights (copyrights and industrial rights).  EK represents the entire private sector and companies of all sizes covering 27 member associations (e.g. Finnish Technology Industry, Finnish Media Industry) and 16.000 member companies across all business sectors including also many industry players in the copyright industry value chain. EK belongs to BUSINESSEUROPE, the European-level association for employers, commerce and industry. 

EK welcomes the opportunity to respond to this public consultation on the review of the EU Copyright Rules and concentrates answering to certain specific questions most relevant to EK and its branch organizations dealing with the copyright industry value chain (these sectors representing e.g. copyright user's, right holder's and intermediary's point of view). We hope that our comments below will be taken into account.

II Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe? 

"service providers" point of view

The world of copyrighted content has changed radically in the past decade thanks to the modern infrastructure and the new technologies provided by digital industries, to the benefit of artists and consumers alike. However, the fragmented copyright systems in Europe have not adapted to new trends in the creation, distribution and consumption of copyrighted content. Whilst we do not believe that there is an absolute need for a fundamental reassessment of the current copyright regime, there is, however, a strong need to modernise certain aspects of the copyright rules in order to make them relevant in today's digital environment. We welcome this opportunity to constructively present our views for a copyright regime fit for the digital age. 
* We really need to reform the market and the pre-requisites for building true crossborder digital content services. The internet is global and borderless in nature, but especially legislation made for old-fashioned world deprive us the full potential of digitalisation and the European market is taken over by non-European countries. 
* Encouraging the emergence and use of lawful online content services is the best way for content creators and producers to gain higher revenues and for the whole value chains in the various content sectors to boost European competitiveness in the EU Digital Single Market.
* 1. Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live? 
* 4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
* "service providers" point of view: YES 
* Today, EU citizens can travel and work anywhere within the EU, however the Digital Single Market for content remains an aspiration. 
* We have an interest in a rich and vibrant market for online content, as they work hard to offer as many services and devices as possible, which are designed to get access to many online content services from anywhere in Europe. However, content licensing does not always allow all content to reach such devices across Member States.
* We therefore encourage the Commission to maintain its commitment to work towards a modern framework for copyright licensing. The EU should also explore possibilities that would allow different licensing rights for different content / purposes / geographical scope (e.g. also licensing rights for global content to be available from one source and for all EU Member States).
* We also urge the Commission to consider various on-going market developments seeing to improve online content distribution. Innovative approaches are needed to meet the needs of right holders, intermediaries, service providers and users. Any new regulation that is considered to protect current, more traditional business models must not hinder the emergence and development of new technologies.  1.	
* 2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU? 
* 4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
* "rights holders" point of view: NO
* The nature of the publishing business is to provide access to the published content wherever the reader is located, for a public that almost always reads in the local language in which the content is produced, to favour freedom of the press and the dissemination of professionally published content.
* Rather than a copyright `problem', territoriality is often the consequence of a business decision to serve the markets where there is a consumer demand. It should be also reminded that acquisition of the web TV rights or other content rights is always an investment to the content by the broadcaster or publisher to provide access to the professional content by the public. Investments require always a sufficient income to the broadcaster/publisher in return.
* We believe that the best way to tackle these issues is to support market led solutions. Publishing is happening cross-border, and even more so with digital. However there are issues that are not in the area of copyright which may sometimes justify why a service provider does choose not to enjoy the principle of freedom to provide service, for example a provider may choose to use geolocation software to make sure that the content is available in the countries for which the provider has acquired a licence (this happens in the music and film sector), the identity of the users is then linked to either i.e. IP addresses or payment cards.  
* Moreover in the field of online payment systems, and for micro transactions in particular, it is key that it is financially sustainable to use online payment systems that are not too expensive to use and that are secure for the user. This affects the availability of online content as a whole, not specifically cross border accessibility. Additionally, lack of interoperability of format standards, as well as national consumer laws, or national laws in the field of defamation, libel and privacy are areas that create uncertainty, and in some cases may be part of the reason why providers refrain from making content available cross border. 
* The current growth and success of online/digital game industry is a good example of a cross-border content services that are based on the employer's copyright regime. Online/digital game industry showcases well the fact the party who carries the business risks of content investments for new online content products/services (like the publishers do) should receive the copyright as smoothly as possible supported for example by the employer's copyright regime.
	

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


3 Linking and browsing

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

"service providers" point of view: NO 
Any trend associating this type of provision with copyright infringement is not desirable for the future development of the digital economy and the modernisation of copyright.
"right holders" point of view: YES in certain cases
 
 There is no need for regulation requiring the right holders' permission for random and non-commercial linking to the Internet location of material. By contrast, services based on systematic commercial linking, in which the content is chosen primarily by the service provider rather than the service user, require the author's permission. Using importing links to make works a part of one's own service do, however, likewise require the author's permission and are licensable. 
 12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 

"service providers" point of view: NO
The viewing of a webpage which would imply the temporary reproduction of copyright protected content should not be subject to the authorisation of the right holder. Any change towards a more restrictive approach makes no sense in the digital age.
"right holders" point of view: YES in certain cases

This is true in certain cases or more precisely when what is involved is not a temporary copy that is technically necessary in order to produce a service, but rather an independent service that substitutes for recorded material that is offered, sold or rented to users.

C Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?

If such a system were put in place, it would need to be on voluntary basis and should not in any case constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. 
From the longer point of view the advantages and disadvantages of a potential voluntary system of registration would be worthwhile examining, keeping in mind the limits set by the Berne Convention.
So far registration is possible in more than 40 countries, according to a WIPO survey and voluntary registration is used for example in US where it is possible.

E. Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?

20.   Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
"service providers" point of view: 

Any further extension of current terms of copyright protection will be questioned, and any extension must be based on economic arguments. There is a need to keep the balance between the protection of creation and investment, and the access to public domain. 
At least the terms of copyright protection shall not in any case be extended.
"right holders" point of view: YES
The digital environment does not itself provide a reason for changing the terms of protection in either direction. 

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

"service providers" point of view 

We wish to make a general comment on this section on limitations and exceptions in the Single Market, which we consider covering the most important questions raised in this section of the consultation. 
On the question of the optional/mandatory aspect of exceptions, our opinion is that the exceptions should not be mandatory and should remain optional. Member States choosing to implement the exceptions should have flexibility in the application thereof.  There is a need to keep a wide degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions, 
We consider that the most pressing issue to address concerns the exception for private copying.
21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 
"right holders" point of view: NO

The EU regulatory framework must be sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of the Member States' different cultural and political value bases.
22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions? 
"right holders" point of view: NO
The harmonisation of exceptions will presumably not promote creative production in Europe. The EU regulation of copyright must be sufficiently flexible.

IV. Private copying and reprography

The Commission has organised several consultations over the past ten years which helped gather a significant body of evidence relating to the operation of copyright levy systems in Europe. In the meantime, no real reform has taken place to address the copyright levy system which remains inefficient, non-transparent, and highly dysfunctional. It is regrettable that the publication of the Recommendations on private copying and reprography levies by Antonio Vitorino, which sought to bring solutions in the short term, was not followed by the application of these recommendations through concrete measures. 
Also, the multiplication of litigation cases both at the national and European levels in recent years illustrates the need to act and reform the broken system of copyright levies. 
We hope that the European Commission will seize the opportunity to propose reforms to the private copying levy systems in the Single Market as transitional measures toward the ultimate phase out of levies and the development of alternative compensation mechanisms more in line with modern consumer expectations and behaviour and digital environment.
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions  in the digital environment?

YES 
	
Copyright levies are completely out of tune with the realities of the digital era, therefore clarification of the scope and application of copyright levies is urgently needed. 
As clearly explained by Mr. Antonio Vitorino in his report on private copying and reprography levies, copyright levies also cause many frictions in the Single Market. 
Regarding the scope of the exception it should indeed be made very clear that licensed copies should not trigger the application of private copying levies, that illegal copies do not fall within the scope of the exception (and that the calculation of harm does not include illegal copies), and the professional use is also outside of the scope.
It has to be unambiguously confirmed that compensation for private copying is exclusively based on harm and therefore should only exist if there is a proven substantial harm to rightholders. The term "harm" must be more precisely defined. 
The Commission should work with the Member States on establishing a roadmap for reform and, most importantly, the ultimate phase out of levies systems. This reform should be based on two main steps:
:: As a first step, levies systems must be reformed via transitional measures - on the basis of Vitorino's recommendations - to improve the current system and chart a path towards its ultimate phase out. This could be achieved through an EU soft law instrument such as a Recommendation.
:: As a second step, device-based levies systems should be replaced by more modern and flexible alternative forms of compensation based on actual demonstrable harm. Member States should be allowed complete discretion to decide which alternative system to implement.
65    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 

NO
Licensed copies should not trigger the application of private copying levies and legislation should not lead to double/multiple payments for the same content.
Mr. Vitorino rightly concludes that content licensed through online business models, e.g. legal downloading and streaming services, should not be subject to levies ("Licensed copies should not trigger the application of levies. The opposite view would pave the way for double payments. Consumers cannot be expected to show understanding for such double payments." A. Vitorino, Recommendations resulting from the mediation on private copying and reprography levies, 2013 - p.7). 
As he summarises, rightholders have already received compensation for licensed content including subsequent copies in the framework of licensing contracts between rightholders and users. In this respect, private copying of licensed copies does not cause any additional harm to rightholders, therefore no extra compensation is justified. 
66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
 
It would be incomprehensible to consider extending to online services a copyright levy system which is not functioning in the offline world. Extending a dysfunctional system from hardware to online services would be a major step back made by the European Union in trying to develop a flourishing Digital Single Market. One must also not forget that the copyright levy system was created for the analogue world and it is on no way fit for the digital era.
67   Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies? 
YES 
Copyright levies are in essence a hidden cost for the consumers. End users who have to pay for private copying are in most cases not aware of the levy. 
An obligation to inform final customers of the amount of the levy included in the price of the products they buy would bring more transparency to the system and allow private users to know that a fair compensation for the acts of private copying they might operate is included in the price of sale of products subject to levies. 
68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services? 

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

There is a long list of specific problems with the functioning of the levy system, which have a significant and negative impact on artists, consumers and industry. The significant and growing number of court cases across the EU and at CJEU level is highly illustrative of the many problems caused by levy systems.
The very important issues to be solved are as follows:

:: There is no common definition of harm in the Member States, and the calculation of harm is not based on actual private copying. 
 :: As a consequence, scope and tariffs vary significantly across the EU.
:: Reimbursement for professional use is almost impossible across the EU.
:: Consumers are completely unaware that a levy for private copying is included in the price of the products they buy.

In the long term perspective the device-based private copying levy system should be eventually phased out and replaced by alternative systems of compensation based on actual harm, if there is still a need for compensation in addition to licencing. We wish to point out that private copying is decreasing as new digital content services evolve and, in the future, one may assume that private copying will be a rare exception.

V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

NO 

Questions concerning reasonable compensation must be resolved on the level of the Member States'contract law. The prior requirement is for freedom of contract and established business practises in national copyright markets. Pan-European uniform criteria cannot be applied to the question.
VII. A single EU Copyright Title

78.   Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 

NO

The establishment of a single EU Copyright Title is not needed. The renewal of certain topics/areas of the EU Copyright Rules can be taken forward without establishment of an EU Copyright Title. The EU copyright system must be left flexible with respects to the systems in the Member States.
