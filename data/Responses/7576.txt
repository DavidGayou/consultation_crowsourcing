II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?


The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market
through licensing agreements

 Show introduction


 1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access online services in an EU
 Member State other than the one in which you live?


    Yes
    Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain
    films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
    software)




    No
    No Opinion




 2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across
 borders in the EU?


    Yes
    Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the
    cost of providing services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples indicating the
    Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in
    general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).




    No
    No Opinion




 3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-
 territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
 Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.


   Authors generally have “exclusive rights” without borders, so they can licence the exploitation of the work without borders as well. But in the
   EU’s audiovisual sector authors usually assign their rights for the whole world to the producer. Their works are exploited globally by the
   producer who can license the exploitation rights for various modes of exploitation and territories. Audiovisual authors are neither able to
   control the distribution of their works, nor the remuneration for the exploitation of their works. The European film and audiovisual sector are
   fragmented into several markets based on languages and types of exploitation of the works. Most audiovisual (online) media services, target
   specific markets. These services do not need and therefore do not request multi-territorial licences.
   Because there is no harmonization of collective rights management in the audiovisual sector, in particular for authors’ rights, only a few
   audiovisual authors’ CMOs (e.g. in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland) are able to clear online rights for their repertoire. In other
   countries, such as Austria, online rights for audiovisual works are individually managed (by the producers).
   Of course audiovisual authors want their works to be widely accessible on online services. They are interested in developing a model for the
   collection and distribution of audiovisual authors’ remuneration for the online exploitation of their works. One major obstacle is that only a few
   audiovisual authors’ CMOs are entitled to clear the online rights for their repertoire. This reduces the interest of service providers for such a
   multi-territorial licence. This lack of harmonisation is an obstacle to pan-European online rights clearance for European audiovisual works. The
   Commission is also unclear about the cooperation possibilities between CMOs and generally prefers to encourage competition. There is also
   no harmonisation of the tax treatment of cross-border royalty payments between Member States. If CMOs from different Member States
   develop a common licensing platform, they expose their members to an additional layer of withholding tax. These problems should be
   urgently solved by the Commission.




 4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would be the best way to tackle
 them?


   The European legislator should provide audiovisual authors with a harmonised guarantee of remuneration for the online exploitation of their
   works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This should be implemented by an unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration enforced
   through a scheme where CMOs are entrusted to collect the remuneration at the level of the final distributors.
   In the audiovisual sector, after the initial transfer of the authors’ making available right to the producer, this right is usually split territorially and
   transferred to many different operators. The contractual chain back to authors is very long and easily broken if one element of the chain
   experience difficulties (e.g. an intermediary going out of business) so that the authors rarely receive any remuneration based on the
   exploitation of the work. Collective management should therefore guarantee actual remuneration for the online exploitation of audiovisual
   works for the authors, and be helpful to users who know where to get the licences from.




  5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where
  you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
  territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in
  certain European countries)?


    Yes
    Please explain by giving examples
      “Territorial restrictions” are more often a “cultural” than a “legal” problem. If you e.g. think about traditional dialect singers and musicians,
      one can hardly imagine a common internal market because of cultural and/or linguistic differences and interests within the various groups
      of consumers. Of course audiovisual authors want their works to be accessible all over Europe as long as all required authorisations have
      been regularly acquired from the producers. In fact there is no distributor in Europe that is able to exploit audiovisual works in all countries
      for all modes of exploitation. Even audiovisual media services, who could technically exploit audiovisual works on a worldwide basis,
      target specific markets and actively promote their catalogue only in a limited number of languages. Therefore one can doubt the actual
      need of these services to acquire pan-European rights if they do not exercise them. Of course licences should match the exploitation
      prospects.

    No
    No Opinion




  6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
  acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
  territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the
  one he is trying to access)?


    Yes
    Please explain by giving examples




    No
    No Opinion




  7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market- led solutions) are needed at EU level
  to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
  protection for right holders?


    Yes
    Please explain




    No
    Please explain
      There is no need for legislative changes to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the internal market, as the current
      legal copyright framework is no obstacle to achieve that goal. The Commission should consider legal initiatives to ensure a system of
      higher protection for rightholders and fair remuneration for the usage of their works. Also the liability provisions of the E-Commerce
      Directive for Internet providers should possibly be revised by the Commission.
      Beyond that, the European legislator should ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the online distribution of their works,
      independently of the country of production and exploitation. With such a level playing field, authors’ collective management organisations,
      entrusted to manage the making available remuneration of audiovisual authors could develop “one-stop-shops” to offer a single licence
      point to online operators. This will, in turn, make it easier for them to pay the remuneration due to the European audiovisual authors of the
      works in their catalogue. This must be a priority for the Commission to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the on-demand
      exploitation of their works whatever the country of exploitation.

    No Opinion




B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in
digital transmissions?
The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions

 Show introduction
  8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders
  – sufficiently clear?


    Yes
    No
    Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as
    in "country of origin" approach)
      Online audiovisual media services should work more with rightholders at the origin of the production and distribution of works in order to
      secure online exploitation rights for cross-border services.



    No Opinion




  9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights
  (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not),
  on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?


    Yes
    Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
      I think that there is no actual problem with the “territorial scope” of the making available right. As indicated above private international law
      related issues should not be solved by “abusing” the Info-Soc Directive. We do not think that a clarification of the territorial scope would
      have any impact on the recognition of the authors’ rights, the possible transfer of rights and their
      ​remuneration. These issues are mainly dealt with in legislation and authors’ contracts. The only way to address the current problems
       related to these issues is to tackle them directly through harmonisation and not through the territorial scope of the making available right.

    No
    No Opinion




2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

 Show introduction


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic
  exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


    Yes
    Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are
    in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
      The “reproduction right” and the “making available right” are two different exclusive rights provided by international, European and
      national copyright laws and their separate application has never created any problems from a practical point of view. Usually rightholders
      cooperate with each other to provide services with the relevant rights. Above that in the audiovisual sector both rights are usually
      managed by the same entities.

    No
    No Opinion




3. Linking and browsing

 Show introduction


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in
  general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


    Yes
    Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
      I do not want to prevent the normal utilisation of the Internet, which is based on a wide array of hyperlinks. But of course it has to be
      considered, that there are many (technically) different ways of linking. A normal hyperlink (i.e. a mere digital reference to content which can
      be found elsewhere on the internet) has to be treated differently than e.g. a deep, framed or embedded link. A hyperlink as such of course
      should not need the authorisation of the rightholder, but for “embedded” or “framed” links within websites, authorisation is needed,
      especially if the linking generates commercial gain. “Deep-linking” on the other hand might be considered as an act of “communication to
      the public” in the sense of the Info- Soc Directive.
      The Commission should respect and take into account the various decisions and pending cases of the CJEU regarding these questions.
    No
    Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount
    to an act of communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
    No Opinion




 12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
 protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under
 specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


    Yes
    Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why




    No
    Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be
    covered by a copyright exception)
      The act of “simple viewing” should never need the authorisation of the rightholder, independently from the medium or technology that
      provides for the content or enables its viewing. “Temporary reproductions” are covered under a mandatory copyright exception of the
      Info-Soc Directive (Art 5/1). However, when the reproduction comes from an obviously illegal platform, the temporary reproduction - but
      not the viewing itself - should be prohibited (as per the ruling in the kino.to case in Germany where the notorious German streaming portal
      site offering links to illegal films and TV series was shut down and the people behind the portal prosecuted).

    No Opinion




4. Download to own digital content

 Show introduction


 13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
 purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


    Yes
    Please explain by giving examples




    No
    No Opinion




 14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal
 framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content)
 concerned.


   Re-sale of protected works such as audiovisual works online would result in new copies, and as far as “forward and delete” technology
   (which erases the first copy from the seller’s hard drive) isn’t applied, which still is the regular case, each reproduction has to be authorised by
   the rightholders. Providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would actually raise more problems
   than it solves. However, a number of issues would have to be carefully considered. For example, whether rightholders would be ensured a fair
   proportion from the proceeds from re-sales, whether it would be feasible to obtain rightholders’ authorisation for each act of resale, whether
   the first sale doctrine should apply in the digital context to content other than software, the meaning of a “copy” for copyright purposes (i.e. if
   the new copy made on the reseller platform amounts to an infringement of the reproduction right), etc.



C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

 Show introduction


 15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other
 subject matter?


    Yes
    No
    No Opinion
 16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


   CMOs already provide such a “registration system” for the identification and licensing of works in various ways. They already administer lots
   of information about rightholders, their works and the usage of works on a national, European and international level and grant relating
   licenses (which is basically true for musical societies, as in fact most of the audiovisual societies in Europe do not administer “primary
   exploitation rights”, as indicated before).
   So there is in fact no need to develop any parallel systems, which would indeed be counterproductive. Above that, it seems unclear, whether
   such a registration system would be voluntary or obligatory, public or private and if it would be for the identification of rightholders only or
   otherwise what rights it would grant. That means it is unclear whether it should be a simple register which keeps a record of concluded
   contracts, or if it is supposed to grant copyright protection.




 17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


   I am against any system that would run against the mandatory “formality prohibition” of the Berne Convention.
   In any way setting up such a registration system would be extremely costly, time consuming and would likely never be reliable since it would
   constantly have to be kept up-to-date. So it probably would be much more efficient to link all the individual databases that already exist and
   are constantly being developed (not only but also) within the audiovisual sector.

   CMOs already provide such a “registration system” for the identification and licensing of works in various ways. They already administer lots
   of information about rightholders, their works and the usage of works on a national, European and international level and grant relating
   licenses (which is basically true for musical societies, as in fact most of the audiovisual societies in Europe do not administer “primary
   exploitation rights”, as indicated before).
   So there is in fact no need to develop any parallel systems, which would indeed be counterproductive. Above that, it seems unclear, whether
   such a registration system would be voluntary or obligatory, public or private and if it would be for the identification of rightholders only or
   otherwise what rights it would grant. That means it is unclear whether it should be a simple register which keeps a record of concluded
   contracts, or if it is supposed to grant copyright protection.




 18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


   Easy to access, free of charge, transparency, easy to adapt, supplied in a wide range of flexible technical formats. Incentives must not be
   connected to copyright privileges as this would contradict international copyright law.




D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

 Show introduction


 19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
 development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


   In the fields of collective management, i.e. also regarding audiovisual works, lots of “International Standars” already exist and are constantly
   developed.
   For example the “International Standard Audiovisual Number” (ISAN) is a voluntary numbering system and metadata scheme enabling the
   identification of any audiovisual work, including films, shorts, documentaries, television programs and their related versions. ISAN provides a
   unique, internationally recognised and permanent reference number for each piece of audiovisual content registered. ISAN is being used in
   production and distribution systems and to drive broadcast transmission systems, facilitating interoperability and information exchange that
   contributes to improving rights management. ISAN is key to content tracking and monitoring, and has been integrated in several
   watermarking and fingerprinting technologies. Collective management of rights relies on identification systems and databases. ISAN is
   progressively being integrated into the databases of audiovisual authors’ CMOs containing information on the works, their authors and other
   rights holders.
   Audiovisual authors’ CMOs have also developed IDA (International Documentation on Audiovisual Works), a worldwide audiovisual rights
   management system and online database that authors’ CMOs consult to get accurate information on audiovisual works and rights owners.
   This global database manages original productions, versions and adaptations in other languages and formats. Each work registration
   contains a minimum set of information: original titles, foreign titles, subtitles, production companies, year and country of production, shooting
   languages, rights owners, ISAN number, IPI (Interested Party Information), exploitation purposes and a unique IDA code. The audiovisual
   authors’ CMOs use IDA to identify the transmitted audiovisual production and rights-owners, retrieve and treat the information before
   distributing the royalties to the identified sister organisations. The sister organisation itself will transfer these royalties to their authors. The
   unique IDA code is used between CMOs when exchanging information on an audiovisual work. Before IDA, authors’ CMOs sent requests by
   e-mail or mail to sister societies, meaning paperwork and rather long identification processes. IDA facilitates their identification and the
   exchange of documentation between CMOs and accelerates the transfer of payments between CMOs.
   Such a database is built for the specific needs of audiovisual authors’ CMOs but uses existing tools such as IPI and ISAN in order to avoid
   the duplication of efforts. It represents a significant investment for these CMOs which will deliver benefits in the long term. IDA is a CISAC tool
   (the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and is a part of the “CISAC Professional Rules” and the “Binding
   Resolutions” for audiovisual authors’ CMOs, rules that aim to improve transparency and quality of service for all CISAC members.
   The European Union could help in building a portal giving some public information and visibility to these tools and how they work together.



E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
 Show introduction


 20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?


    Yes
    Please explain
      I definitely believe that the term of protection should not be changed and especially not be shortened. This would have negative impacts
      on the ability of rightholders to exploit their works during the period of the exclusivity of their rights. The EU-Directive harmonising the term
      of protection of copyright and certain related rights recalled that the Berne Convention lays down only minimum terms of protection,
      leaving Contracting States free to grant longer terms. As certain Member States had exercised this entitlement, the resulting differences
      between national laws were considered as distorting competition in the internal market, which justified harmonisation to make terms of
      protection identical throughout the Community.
      The Directive recalls that the minimum term of protection laid down by the Berne Convention (life of the author and 50 years after his
      death) was intended to provide protection for the author and the first two generations of his descendants and considered that the average
      lifespan in the Community had increased, to the point where this term was no longer sufficient to cover two generations. Therefore, in
      order to establish a high level of protection, which at the same time meets the requirements of the internal market and the need to
      establish a legal environment conducive to the harmonious development of literary and artistic creation in the Community, the Directive
      harmonised the term of protection for copyright at 70 years after the death of the author. Therefore, apart from harmonisation, the main
      reason for the extension of the term of protection from 50 to 70 years was the extension of the average lifespan in Europe.
      I do not see any reason linked to the digital environment that would question the duration of terms of copyright protection.

    No
    Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


 Show introduction


 21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives
 are optional for the Member States?


    Yes
    Please explain by referring to specific cases




    No
    Please explain
      The current EU law and international treaties provide sufficient flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations. There is no practical
      need for any new exceptions or to make the existing exceptions under the Info-Soc-Directive mandatory, as there is no evidenced need
      for such legislative changes. CMOs provide various solutions through dedicated licensing for teaching, educational institutions, research
      etc. There is no problem with the fact that most exceptions provided in EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States. The list
      of exceptions of the 2001/29/EC Directive is very long and encompasses all possible exceptions in the EU, but not for direct
      implementation by all Member States. Making this list mandatory would severely undermine the protection of authors’ rights.


    No Opinion




 22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of
 such exceptions?


    Yes
    Please explain by referring to specific cases




    No
  Please explain
    There is no reason nor is there a justification for such a step. The principle of subsidiarity has to be respected. Moreover, the current legal
    frame is sufficient and provides the flexibility required in the current harmonization process.



  No Opinion




23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by
referring to specific cases


 There is no need to add or remove limitations and exceptions to/from the existing catalogue. The existing catalogue reflects a good
 compromise at EU level.




24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory
framework for limitations and exceptions?


  Yes
  Please explain why




  No
  Please explain why
    I am definitely against the introduction of a US-type “fair use” exception in Europe, since it is not adapted to EU-law and provides no legal
    certainty as issues can only be resolved in front of the courts. A higher number of disputes and court cases would be fundamentally in
    contradiction with the Single Market objectives.


  No Opinion




25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ,
periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of
such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.




26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?


  Yes
  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to




  No
  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
    The territoriality of exceptions and limitations matches the “territoriality principle” of copyright and respects different legal and cultural
    specificities in the member states. I think, that the territoriality of limitations and exceptions do not constitute any problems.



  No Opinion




27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should
the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
whom, where?)


 It seems reasonable that fair compensation is due in the place where the end user benefits from the exception, as is the case, for example,
 with the private copying exception (levies are due in the country in which the “harm” to the rightholder arises, i.e. in the country in which the
 end user who bought the product resides according to the “Opus ruling” of the CJUE). In addition, it is crucial that remuneration is provided
 to the rightholders in the country where they reside, which is possible because of reciprocal agreements between collective management
   organisations.



A. Access to content in libraries and archives

 Show introduction


 28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception
 to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
 (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational
 establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?


    Yes
    Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.




    No
    No Opinion




 29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




 30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary
 institutions should be covered and under which conditions?




 31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


   As far as “film heritage institutions” are concerned, the 2001 Copyright Directive provides for carefully crafted exceptions addressing the
   needs of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives. These exceptions allow film archive institutions to
   fulfil their public interest missions.
   Above these exceptions, various European CMOs have offered their help to film and audiovisual archives institutions on many occasions to
   address their needs in relation to the use of the cinematographic and audiovisual works contained in their collections and their related
   authors’ rights. This has resulted in specific arrangements in a number of countries: collective agreements in France, mandatory collective
   administration of broadcasters’ archives in Switzerland, extended collective agreements in the Netherlands and in the Nordic countries, etc.
   The Commission should work as a facilitator to encourage film archive institutions and their European representatives to explore the
   possibility of further agreements with audiovisual authors’ organisations whether at national or EU level.




2. Off-premises access to library collections

 Show introduction


 32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
 agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or
 parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
 (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to consult, including
 across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national

  enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
  (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?




The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the management of physical and online
  collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?




  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-
  premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-
  lending? What problems have you encountered?


    Because of the nature of the internet, the difference between libraries’ traditional activities and online consultation and e-lending is huge. The
    conditions for these new activities have to be discussed with authors’ representative organisations like CMOs through licencing processes
    which will allow libraries to develop these new activities and for authors to be remunerated.
4. Mass digitisation

 40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a
 collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of
 the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that
 out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

 41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types of content (e.g. for audio-
 or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


    Yes
    Please explain
      I am fully committed to pursue the project that was started in the “Licences for Europe” (Audiovisual and Film Heritage Institutions)
      process and to find a way to undertake mass digitization and clearance for online uses of the high volume of older works in the archives of
      film heritage institutions and public services broadcasters. Audiovisual authors’ CMOs have a central role to play in helping these
      institutions preserve and offer to the public the cultural heritage of great works.
      Thanks to the “Statement of Principles and Procedures for heritage films online” concluded between ACE, FERA, FIAPF and the SAA
      during “Licences for Europe”, film heritage institutions and rightholders’ representatives now have a clear roadmap to discuss and agree
      terms for digitizing, restoring and making available European film heritage. It will enable film heritage institutions to free up European films
      stored in their archives while guaranteeing rightholders an appropriate share of the rewards.
      As far as broadcasters’ archives are concerned, no broad agreement including all stakeholders could be reached during the “Licences for
      Europe” timeframe. EBU and the SAA together developed some recommendations highlighting that collective licensing solutions are
      particularly suitable for the large scale clearance of rights. This would help make a very significant amount of works available, particularly
      for research and educational purposes. Further discussions are needed to develop a MoU or any other type of general agreement that
      would propose a suitable solution for mass digitization and rights clearance of broadcasters’ archives based on collective management.

 existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?


    Yes
    Please explain by giving examples
      Many creators, also those who grant licenses to third parties on the basis of creative commons licenses, find it unacceptable that persons
      relying on their content do not respect their moral rights, in particular the right of attribution as well the adaptation right. In practice,
      creators who devote their professional life to the creation of works, do not consider it a compliment if their finished work is adapted,
      amended or changed by others. At the same time, persons exploiting and disrespecting rights of others in this manner frequently have the
      intention of exploiting such creations of others in order to monetize them, eg on Youtube, for their own benefit. Every creator therefore
      should have the right to effectively and efficiently be able to enforce how third parties use his or her work. Whether the third party has
      commercial interests should not be decisive in order to be in control.

 61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


  The use of pre-existing protected works to create user-generated content needs the authorisation of the authors or their representatives (in
  particular, to guarantee respect for moral rights), unless an exception can be invoked.




 62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which activities should be
 covered and under what conditions?




 63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


  As traditional media are usually obliged to produce European content and as broadcasters are obliged to broadcast such content, I consider
  it to be discriminating that new media are not obliged to contribute to the financing of such content at all.




IV. Private copying and reprography


Show introduction


 64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography
 exceptions in the digital environment?


   Yes
   Please explain
  No
  Please explain
    The CJEU has given necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of private copying exception and since the
    interpretation of other substantive issues are currently pending with the Court, there is no need to deal further with the scope and
    application of the system at EU level.
    Rightholders have provided all the necessary practical and operational solutions to implement those decisions for a smoother and more
    streamlined functioning of the Internal Market.
    Currently the only missing element is the willingness of the manufacturers and distributors of recording devices (almost all of which are
    non-EU companies) to comply with EU law.

  No Opinion




65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by
rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?


  Yes
  Please explain
    “Licensing” and application of “private copying levies” co-exist and they are not mutually exclusive. This point of view has already been
    clarified by the CJEU in its “VG Wort vs. Kyocera” ruling.
    One of Mr. Vitorino’s recommendations (“licensed copies do not cause harm”) suggests that all subsequent copies made of a work
    following purchase from digital services can be covered by licenses granted by rightholders to these services. Mr. Vitorino therefore
    proposed to eliminate levies for “new business models in the digital environment”. This is based on a gross misconception of both the
    private copying system and the multitude of new digital services which provide access to protected works. Private copies cannot be
    licensed since they are covered by a statutory exception to copyright under the 2001/29 Copyright Directive.
    Therefore “licensing” and “fair compensation for private copying” can only be separate issues. Moreover, if the private copying exception
    was questioned and private copies inserted into licences, the ones that would suffer most from such a change would be consumers and
    authors, the consumers losing their freedom to copy and the authors their fair compensation.
    In practice, the authorisation, licence fee and commercial terms are negotiated by the holders of exclusive rights with each digital service
    during the licensing process, whereas fair compensation is collected through the levy system and distributed to rightholders by CMOs. Mr.
    Vitorino’s proposal derives from the flawed idea that digital services would allow rightholders to be compensated directly. In practice, only
    few rightholders or categories of rightholders grant licences to digital services (the producers or further intermediaries).
    Other rightholders, such as audiovisual authors who transferred their exclusive rights to the producer sometimes for a lump-sum payment,
    do not have any direct relation with digital services and therefore, no possibility to be paid directly.
    In this field, a huge advantage of the private copying system is that it corrects inequalities between rightholders and guarantees that each
    category of rightholders benefits from a fair share of the value.

  No
  Please explain




  No Opinion




66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing
allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


 I believe that the application of levies to certain online services is justified and does not think that it would hinder the development and
 functioning of new business models. One of the main reasons is that, just like the prices of products across Europe do not vary in proportion
 to the levy rates, the prices of online services/new business models are most probably also unaffected by the levy rates.
 More copying for private use takes place now than ever before. The devices and media which enable or host private copies of protected
 works have increased, with storage capacities which have grown exponentially.
 Consumers transfer songs and videos from computers to hard drives to phones to tablets to online lockers and back again in order to save
 and access their personal libraries whenever and wherever they want. All of these processes are undeniably acts of private copying.
 In addition, in line with the principle of technical neutrality, copies made via “cloud services” (and other future digital services which do not yet
 exist) many have the same purpose (private use) as the copies made by private individuals on their phones, tablets, etc. so should be
 included in the private copying system.
 Applying private copying to certain cloud-based services means that copies made on those specific cloud-based services would be taken
 into account by usage studies which assess the harm caused.




67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?


  Yes
  Please explain
    I agree with the objective, but does not believe that this technical point requires a legislative change at EU level within the Info-Soc
    Directive. This is certainly not a big problem in terms of cross-border application of levies. In fact, it is already applied in some Member
    States and its application can easily be extended to all Member States with the agreement of all stakeholders involved.
    Past and recent consultation processes on private copying levies have shown that stakeholders agree that levies should be clearly visible
    on all bills and contracts in the products’ sales chain (this is for example already the case in Belgium thanks to a new Belgian law
     applicable since 1st of December 2013) and on consumers’ invoices and till receipts.
     In addition, consumers should be informed of the amount and destination of the levies and more generally the reason for this mechanism
     which compensates the freedom to copy they have thanks to the private copying exception. This would help consumers understand how
     important the levy system is for the EU’s culture and rightholders and that they are part of and benefit from this virtuous system.
     Anyway and for the sake of transparency, consumers should be informed how much of the product/services price is due to copyright
     levies.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate
payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?


   Yes
   Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or
   ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.




   No
   Please explain
     The CJEU has already clarified all these issues in its recent judgments. As long as the rulings of the Court are followed, there is no need
     for any further legislative “clarification” at EU level.
     Following the “Opus ruling” by the CJEU the rule would be that the levy is due in the Member State in which the final user who purchased
     the product resides since that is where the “harm” to the rightholder would arise. In any case, even if undue levy payments occasionally
     did occur, “ex-ante exemptions” and “ex-post-reimbursement systems” should be in place to ensure that such equipment does not bear
     levies.

   No Opinion




69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly
unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example
you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).


  I think that devices and blank media can serve other purposes than for the private copying of protected works. This should be taken into
  account when determining tariffs applicable to devices used to make private copies. In addition, there are cases where certain devices and
  media will clearly not be used for the purpose of private copying (e.g. “professional uses”). In this context, ex-ante-exemptions and ex-post-
  reimbursement systems should be in place to ensure that the equipment concerned does not bear levies. However, exempting any business
  from private copying levies would be excessive, since equipment bought by companies can also generate private copies (e.g. business
  handys that are also used to store music for private use).
  It is important to point out that the determining factor should in any way be the nature of the use, not the quality of the purchaser.
  As recommended by the CJEU in the “Padawan”ruling (C-467/08), professional uses should be excluded from payment of the levy, but not
  necessarily all purchases of professional users. Devices such as tablets or smartphones, despite being the property of a company, may well
  in fact be used by employees to copy protected works for private use. Recommending that private copying levies should apply exclusively to
  purchases by natural persons as private users would artificially reduce the scope of the private copying system.
  Exemption and refund systems for professional uses should be designed at national level in consideration of the specificities of the Member
  States concerned.
  The “Austro-Mechana” CJEU ruling (C-521/11) confirmed that reimbursement schemes for the levies paid on devices that are not ultimately
  used for private purposes comply with EU law, as long as they are effectively applied and do not constitute an excessive burden for those
  who are entitled to reimbursement.




70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?


  see above




71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best
be solved?
  Firstly the rightholders’ proposal to introduce a single declaration point would facilitate declaration and payment procedures by
  manufacturers/importers. The proposal to create a single European declaration was put forward by European rightholders during the 2008-
  2009 dialogue, and agreed with the ICT industry. It aims to facilitate the implementation of the “Opus” ruling of the CJEU (C- 462/09). Via the
  “European Central Point” mechanism, distance sellers could submit declarations of sales of goods eligible to private copying levies at a single
  EU entry point, while the compensation would be invoiced and paid in the country of destination.
  Secondly, the most efficient and cost-effective way to collect levies is to do so at the earliest stage of the sales chain, i.e. the manufacture or
  import stage. Shifting the liability to pay levies onto retailers, as proposed by Mr. Vitorino, would render the system extremely complex and
  costly since this would significantly increase the number of those responsible for paying the levies and the means needed to ensure billing
  and control systems.
  The prime responsibility of manufacturers and importers for payment of the levies must go hand in hand with joint liability of all entities
  throughout the chain of sales down to the final consumer in order to avoid potential fraud and unfair competition. This principle was also
  agreed between representatives of rightholders and the ICT industry during the 2008-2009 dialogue.
  Thirdly, the fact that leviable devices and blank media differ across Member States means that the same product can be subject to private
  copying levies in a Member State and not in another. Compensation systems should be in place for all devices and media whose value is
  increased by multimedia storage and playback features. Therefore, a consistent definition of devices and media subject to private copying
  levies in the respective Member States should be sought. Rightholders’ organisations proposed during the 2008-2009 dialogue that all
  products (devices and media) able to be used to make private copies of protected works should be eligible for the private copying
  compensation scheme, with a list of products established and regularly updated at EU level. However, the interruption of the dialogue by the
  ICT industry in 2010 did not end in any concrete result and the Vitorino report was a missed opportunity as, despite suggesting a degree of
  harmonisation (such as regarding the definition of harm), Mr. Vitorino recommended Member State flexibility in the choice of devices subject
  to levies.
  Fourthly,I agree that a quick and harmonised levy setting procedure should be developed across Europe. This would mean putting in place a
  European framework of definitions, principles and procedures to be respected by all Member States in the establishment of their levy setting
  process.




V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


Show introduction


 72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for
 the exploitation of your works and performances?


  Fair remuneration of authors is a very important issue related in particular to the online distribution of audiovisual works. For audiovisual
  authors, such a “best mechanism” to ensure that they receive adequate remuneration for the exploitation of their works does not yet exist.
  “Adequate remuneration” should relate to the use made of the authors’ works and should in particular reward the success of works. This is
  why “buy-out contracts”, which prevent this from happening, would never amount to mechanisms guaranteeing adequate remuneration.
  Contractual practices in the vast majority of European countries deprive audiovisual authors of their rights and prevent them from receiving
  fair remuneration, not only but in particular for the online distribution of their works. Audiovisual authors in most countries are forced, because
  of their weak bargaining position and the absence of legislation to protect them, to assign all their rights and receive a one-off fee at the
  production stage with no further payments linked to the exploitation of the work, except for collectively managed rights such as “cable
  retransmission” and “private copying”.
  These further payments linked to the exploitation of the work (which can continue for years) are however essential for authors to make a living
  in-between projects. The characteristic of this profession is that it can take years to prepare a film and enter into production.

  I therefore proposes to by-pass these unfair contractual practices and to develop a sustainable remuneration system which would secure
  audiovisual authors’ remuneration for their making available right in the digital market, taking advantage of the new technologies.
  Such a proposal for European legislation builds on the harmonisation experience in the EU, e.g. the 1992 Rental Right Directive which
  provides for an “unwaivable remuneration right for the rental” or the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive which provides for mandatory
  collective administration of the “cable retransmission right”.
  Concerning “online uses” and in the case an audiovisual author has transferred his making available right to a producer, he should retain the
  right to obtain “equitable remuneration” for the “making available” which cannot be waived, as it is the case for the “rental right”. The
  equitable remuneration should be paid by audiovisual media services that make audiovisual works available to the public on- demand. Its
  administration should be entrusted to collective management organisations representing audiovisual authors, unless other audiovisual
  authors’ organisations, such as unions or guilds, are in a better position to guarantee such remuneration in a specific country.
  This European legislation is a necessity as contractual practices are unable to guarantee such remuneration to audiovisual authors for the
  making available of their works. European producers, which are mainly small companies, are very much focused on the production stage and
  little involved in the subsequent exploitation. They have therefore not developed industrial processes and mechanisms to trace and
  administer payments due to authors for the distribution of their works on multiple platforms and most of them would prefer not to do it at all
  since it would be costly. The only entities to do this are authors’ collective management organisations. They are today ready to invest further
  in order to address the remuneration due to audiovisual authors for the online distribution of their works.
  It has to be clarified that this proposal does not interfere with the producer’s role. It aims at organising the remuneration due to authors, once
  the producer has decided to make the work available to the public in such a manner and at the time he chooses. It therefore means that any
  on- demand exploitation of an audiovisual work will continue to have to be cleared with the producer or with the making available right holder
  appointed by the producer or subsequent contractor.
  Be it offline or online exploitations, collective management is the best solution to strike a balance between easy rights clearance, legal
  certainty and adequate remuneration for audiovisual authors.
 73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?


    Yes
    Please explain
      I definitely support fairer contractual terms and practices, whilst acknowledging that this will not solve all the problems, in particular the
      remuneration issue of audiovisual authors for the exploitation of their works. Any initiative in this field should therefore at least complement
      the introduction into EU legislation of an unwaivable right to remuneration of audiovisual authors for their making available right, based on
      the revenues generated from the online distribution of their works and collected by collective management organisations from final
      distributors.

    No
    Please explain why




    No Opinion




 74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you
 identify?


   In most European countries, audiovisual authors suffer from unfair contractual terms (excessive transfer of rights in terms of scope and
   duration, transfer of rights to remuneration, etc.) imposed by producers or broadcasters in the individual negotiation of their contract. These
   negotiations too often result in “buy-out contracts”, authors receiving a lump sum payment for the writing and/or directing of the film, with no
   further payment no matter how commercially successful the film goes on to be. Even when authors sign contracts which respect their
   economic interests and provide for additional remuneration, they rarely receive any payment automatically, except when collective rules are in
   place and enforced in particular by collective rights management organisations.
   In parallel to European initiatives to ensure proper remuneration of authors, consideration should be given to developing key standards for fair
   and enforceable contractual terms in individual contracts, including the prohibition of certain clauses in contracts.
   In addition, one way of ensuring the enforceability of fair contractual terms would be that producers applying for public funds for the
   production of films and audiovisual works should be obliged to provide a copy of authors’ contracts among the documentation. The body
   providing for the financial support would have the obligation to check it. This would be a strong incentive for producers to better respect
   authors’ rights as it would become a pre-condition for obtaining public financial support.




VI. Respect for rights


 Show introduction


 75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with
 a commercial purpose?


    Yes
    Please explain




    No
    Please explain
      The scope of the question and clarifications of the civil enforcement system in the EU should not be limited to infringements committed
      with a “commercial purpose”. All infringements should be punished, but of course sanctions should be more severe for commercial
      purpose infringements. Leaving all “non-commercial” acts out of protection would not comply with the respect for the exclusive rights
      provided by international and European copyright law.
      I believe that the respect for rights and the enforcement of rights are as important as the scope and definition of the rights themselves.
      The “safe harbour regime” provided by the “E-Commerce- Directive” should therefore be re-considered for copyright related activities.

    No Opinion




 76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
 Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online
 copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
 intermediaries?


   I strongly encourage the Commission to examine the possibility of integrating a “notice and takedown” type mechanism in the future revised
   Enforcement Directive. In addition the notification procedure (and the information to be provided) as well as the impact of this procedure, i.e.
   the action to be taken by the hosting provider (immediate take down, or as quickly as possible within 24 hours) and stay down of illegal
   content (not just the links to it) should be harmonised.
   In addition, cooperation between rightholders and intermediaries could also lead to the development of useful “filtering technologies” which
   could be developed by platforms and implemented at the stage when users upload content onto their servers. This filtering technology would
   be based on databases of works which have been registered, with a view to identifying and blocking illegal content. In this context,
   cooperation between rights holders and providers is an essential key to developing such databases of protected content and should therefore
   be encouraged.



 77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
 copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?


    Yes
    Please explain




    No
    Please explain
      According to the Court of Justice of the European Union a fair balance must be struck between the various rights at stake (such as the
      right to data protection and the right to property, which includes IPR) given that both are recognised as fundamental rights by the Charter
      of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
      In addition, the limited scope of the right to information to acts carried out on a commercial scale (article 8 of the Directive) prevents the
      full exercise of the right to information in all infringing situations.
      The Commission should take the opportunity of any revision of the Enforcement Directive to guarantee an effective balance between IPR
      and the data protection right, in order to allow the provision on the right of information to effectively protect right holders.

VII. A single EU Copyright Title


 Show introduction


 78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent
 framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


    Yes
    No
    No Opinion




 79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the
 Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?


   I do not see the need for “an optional unitary EU Copyright Title” as already proposed by the Commission in its “Green Paper on the online
   distribution of audiovisual works”. This proposal was first made by the Commission in 2009 and then repeated in several documents but the
   Commission never explained the need for and the use of such a title. The only information delivered in the Green Paper was that “authors or
   producers of audiovisual works would have the option to register their works and then obtain a single title that would be valid throughout the
   EU”. This very brief presentation raises two questions: the registration condition and the nature of the title.
   In terms of copyright protection, the Berne Convention prohibits any formality such as registration as a condition for the enjoyment and
   exercise of rights. Authors are very much attached to this prohibition which guarantees their rights in all circumstances as far as their creation
   is original and therefore deserves protection. Consequently, authors are very reluctant to see any system based on registration as it
   endangers their authorship of works.
   From a practical point of view, to pursue such a proposal, the Commission should then either undertake to revise the Berne convention or to
   define the nature of the title out of the copyright sphere.
   Because of the formality prohibition, such titles do not exist in the copyright sphere. The only existing registries in the audiovisual sector have
   limited scope and impact which do not affect rights’ protection and exercise (for example the necessary work declaration to an authors’
   society for an author to receive related payments, or the French cinema public registry which offers the statutory publication of certain
   contracts).




VIII. Other issues
 Show introduction


  80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how
  such matters should be addressed.


    -Investing in new technology, software and systems to keep their licensing operations fit for purpose
    -Improving their governance, transparency and accountability to members and users
    -Simplifying their licensing procedures to reduce transaction costs
    -Innovating in the kind of licences being offered
    -Making it a central objective to see the works of members receive the greatest possible
    legitimate distribution
    -Promoting the use of copyright works for education and cultural purposes
    -Making it a priority to engage young people directly whether they are users or creators of
    copyright works – and sometimes both at the same time – so that they learn respect for the value of creativity and are encouraged to express
    themselves creatively.
