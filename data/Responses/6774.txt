Response of LATVIA to the Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules

I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.	The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions

Latvia believes that the principle of territoriality within the field of copyright is essential and should be maintained. The cross-border availability of content services has to be ensured mainly via market-led solutions. 
However, we would welcome discussions on possible actions at the EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market and the EU should encourage initiatives aimed at preservation of cultural diversity.

B.	The definiton of the rights involved in digital transmissions

Latvia welcomes the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in the Svensson case (C-466/12). We believe that a hyperlink to another website containing works protected by copyright does not constitute communication to the public. In any case a requirement to license the use of hyperlinks would be too burdensome for internet users.
As regards the applicability of the temporary reproduction exception to the viewing of web-pages, Latvia considers the existing exception provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC to be applicable and adequate.
Latvia would welcome a comprehensive analysis and discussions at the EU level in relation to the resale of digital files, especially on the economic implications of the creation of digital resale markets.

C. 	Registration of works and other subject matter

Latvia believes that the creation of registration systems at the EU level would be useful in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter. Registration systems could facilitate the availability of online services, legal certainty as well as serve the needs of memory institutions. 
In the course of national consultation the Latvian stakeholders have been mostly supportive of the establishment of such systems.
In order to ensure effective protection of right holders and respect for the existing international obligations, the registration should be provided on a voluntary basis. At the same time it could be incentivised by different legislative initiatives, for example, simplified enforcement procedure for registered works or other subject matter.
However, the establishment of registers should not create excessive administrative or financial burden for right holders or users of works and other subject matter.

D. 	The use and interoperability of identifiers

Latvia believes that the use of identifiers for works and other subject matter should be promoted at the EU level. The EU should also encourage development of open standards for identifiers as well as automated licensing solutions.

E. 	Term of protection

Latvia believes that terms of protection must serve as an encouragement to create new works and other subject matter. Any changes to the terms provided by the international treaties must be based on economic and legal evidence. The research could be carried out on possible reduction of the terms of protection for the works of utilitarian nature, for example, computer programs and databases.
 
II.	Limitations and exceptions

Latvia notes the essential role of limitations and exceptions in providing balance among the interests of stakeholders (right holders, users, society as a whole). Limitations and exceptions facilitate flexibility of the copyright law and can serve as an instrument helping to adapt the existing law to the requirements of the digital environment. Limitations and exceptions are especially important in cases where there are no licensing mechanisms available or they are not effective enough.
Limitations and exceptions play essential role in the development of cultural and social policy of each EU Member State. Therefore we do not support their full harmonization at the EU level. Member States should be able to form their laws on limitations and exceptions according to their national circumstances.
At the same time Latvia deems it necessary to review and adjust the scope of existing limitations and exceptions established in the EU directives, most notably in the Information society directive (Directive 2001/29/EC). The review should be focused on compliance of limitations and exceptions to the digital environment as well as their impact on provision of cross-border services.
We would have concerns about introduction of "fair use" provision at the EU level. It would decrease legal certainty both for right holders and users and the level of de facto harmonization of limitations and exceptions. However, we would welcome an evaluation on possibility to establish new limitations and exceptions by the Member States outside the exhaustive list of the Information society directive according to the three-step test.

A.	Access to content in libraries and archives

It is essential to equally ensure everyone's right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits as well as the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author (Article 27 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
Cultural institutions play a significant role in preservation and availability of cultural heritage. The ability of these institutions to effectively fulfil their public-interest missions has to be ensured also within the digital environment, both via licensing solutions and the review of limitations and exceptions.
It is important to ensure mass digitisation and preservation of cultural heritage even if there are no licensing mechanisms available. Availability of cultural heritage online provided by memory institutions should be evaluated in the context of its impact on the rights of right holders to receive remuneration for the use of their works and other subject matter. However, lack of market-led solutions or their inefficiency should not threaten cultural diversity and availability of cultural heritage.

B.	Teaching

Latvia recognises the importance of exception for teaching purposes in ensuring balance between interests of right holders and each individual's right to education.
At the same time it is vital to avoid unjustified delays in supply of cross-border e-learning services. The research could be carried out on possible obstacles and their prevention.

C.	Research

No specific problems have been identified so far in Latvia in relation to exception for research purposes. The Member States should be able to adjust this exception according to their national circumstances within the scope of its existing regulation in the Information society directive.

D.	Disabilities

Latvia has established in its Copyright Law an exception on behalf of visually and hearing impaired persons. Latvia is also in favour of the aims of the Marrakesh Treaty concluded in June 2013 which facilitates access to published works by visually impaired persons and persons with print disabilities.

E.	Text and data mining
	
No specific problems have been identified so far in Latvia in relation to the use of text and data mining techniques in research. However, we support a comprehensive study on the issue to identify the necessity for legislative solutions.

F.	User-generated content

Latvian stakeholders have not raised concerns about the creation and dissemination of user-generated content. As a possible solution Latvia prefers the development of licensing systems over legislative amendments unless the licensing systems prove to be inefficient.

III.	Private copying and reprography

For a long time there have been on-going discussions among stakeholders on the review of private copying exception in Latvia. As this exception is linked to the functioning of the Single Market it could be further harmonized at the EU level.
The CJEU in its recent judgments has provided a considerable clarification of the scope of the private copying exception established in the Information society directive. However, adjustment of this provision at the EU level could ensure improved legal certainty.
Latvia believes that the review of the private copying exception should include an evaluation of the use of works and subject matter in cloud computing, TV recording and archiving services as well as the interaction of existing licensing mechanisms and private copying levies. The levy should not be claimed in cases where payment for the copying has already been received, for example, where the user has bought a digital download or online service.
The obligation of making levies visible on the invoices of the products subject to levies should not be determined at the EU level and should be left for the decision of the Member States according to their national circumstances (for example, possible administrative or financial burden).   

IV.	Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The establishment of legislative framework that facilitates the provision of fair remuneration to authors and performers for their creative contribution is an essential task of every country. Latvia believes that this task should primarily be a matter of national law. Currently, there is no necessity to elaborate legislative initiatives, in particular, of contract law, at the EU level.

V.	Copyright enforcement 

It is of vital importance to ensure an efficient civil enforcement for copyright infringements. We believe that it is more dependent on improved efficiency of existing legislative measures than their amendments. At the same time there is a necessity to provide the balance between enforcement measures and adequate protection of the right for a private life and data protection.

VI.	A single EU Copyright Title

Latvia is not in favour of the establishment of a unified EU Copyright Title, even though several stakeholders have been supportive of the idea.
The establishment of a unified EU Copyright Title would be a long-term project diminishing the possibilities to focus on efficient handling of urgent copyright issues at the EU level. Due to different copyright systems (droit d'auteur/copyright) it would be difficult to achieve sufficiently detailed alignment of all the respective rights. Lastly, the creation of the unified Title would not solve the problems of diverse implementation of the EU copyright law in different Member States. There is a certain risk that the current case-law of CJEU could lose its meaning.
