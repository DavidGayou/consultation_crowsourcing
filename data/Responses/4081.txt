      II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
B.      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
        authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
!
!
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
        rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
        download) create problems for you?
 YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
………Performing rights collection societies should be required to allow their members to
administer the rights to their own works.

11.     Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
        protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
        subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
……In general, the provision of a hyperlink to a work is essentially advertising, rather than
making available. It is equivalent to putting up a sign saying “this record is available at the
record store across the street”.

      IV. Private copying and reprography
!
!
64.    In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
       the private copying and reprography exceptions1 in the digital environment?
                                                        




 YES – Please explain
…………There is much confusion over this issue, and this confusion can lead to honest
consumers being made to feel like criminals and to small-scale pirates feeling that tehy’re
doing nothing wrong.

65.    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
       a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
       rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?2
                                                                    




 YES – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain
…There should be a clear distinction between copying for personal use or to create a
‘mixtape’ for a friend, and copying with intent to make available to others on a large scale.
The former helps the copyright owner; the latter injures them.

      V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
!
72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
       combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
       for the exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
………Royalty collection societies should be required to allow members to administer their
own rights for specific exploitations of specific works. The current situation, whereby
societies commonly insist on transfer of rights and allow the creator to administer them only
in one or more broad categories, means that collection society members are prohibited by
their societies from utilisation of many distribution routes. If the creator resigns from the
collection society so that they can use these routes, then the royalties from other exploitation
routes cannot be retrieved. There needs to be full flexibility here so that creators are not
forced to choose which routes they will not use. I believe the US collection society ASCAP
allows this sort of flexibility so that, for example, its members can collect royalties from
commercial radio broadcasts, via ASCAP, but can also personally grant broadcast rights to
not-for-profit online radio stations which so not pay licence fees to ASCAP.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
       contracts)?
 YES – Please explain
……The clause in royalty collection society contracts that requires creators to transfer rights
to the society and to refrain from administering rights themselves is unfairly restrictive on
creators wishing to exploit non-mainstream distribution routes.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
 NO – Please explain why

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
       address the shortcomings you identify?
