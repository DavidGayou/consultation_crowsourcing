The VERE Association for the Return and Recycling of electrical and electronic Devices represents the interests
of more than 3,000 SME’s even at political level, being the agent for suppliers, manufacturers and trade
associations. VERE stands up for a fair implementation regarding the legislation in the sector of product
responsibility for electrical and electronic devices for all market players in Germany and EU. Focusing on this
subject VERE Association is having the largest number of members in Germany.



By initiating its own service company “take-e-way” the VERE Association provides solutions for the
implementation of requirements and obligations in conformity with the laws mentioned above for small and
medium-sized companies in Germany and 36 further nations.



Since five years VERE is even affected by copyright law while at least 1,000 of its members generally have to
comply with the copyright claims and want to attend their legal duties duly and in an exemplary manner. Due to
the legal landscape and the regulatory framework of finding and processing levies on electrical hardware
products our members are not able to fulfil their legal duties. This leads to unfair and intransparent market
conditions for all participants and in consequence destroys work employment and companies.



Hardware based copyright levies cannot work anymore and need to be replaced

The questions raised in connection with the compensation for private copying are missing the most
fundamental and, thus, important item: Are hardware based levies a suitable tool which can work at all in the
digital area anymore?1

Nearly all companies involved in the calculation and payment of levies and copyright levy experts who have to
deal with levies on a day-to-day basis have realized that the system is broken, unfair, inefficient, and does not
work. Structurally, a system seeking compensation of right holders from end-users through device/media based
levies cannot work in the digital and cloud age. It will never do, and working on symptoms will not help. It must
be abolished (and may be replaced by another system if a flat compensation next to individual licensing is still
appropriate at all). This is clear for a variety of reasons:

1.   Product innovation cycles vs. litigation cycles

     It is mandatory under EU law (cf. CJEU judgments C-467/08 – Padawan, ground 2, recitals 48 et seq.; C-
     462/09 - Stichting de Thuiskopie, recital 28 et seq. and C-521/11 - Amazon.com International Sales, recital
     25 et seq.) and national constitutional laws that the hardware manufacturers, importers and dealers – as

1
 This statement deals with the compensation for digital copying, not for reprographic copying. However, even for the latter
hardware based levies are not suitable and not needed in modern times anymore. An operator levy (i.e. a levy on operators
of photocopier shops etc.), if at all, would be sufficient.
                                                      2



intermediaries who do not undertake the private copying – must be able to pass through the levies. The
financial burden for levies must not be beard by the hardware industry, but by the end-users who benefit
(cf. CJEU judgments C-467/08 – Padawan, recital 48; C-462/09 - Stichting de Thuiskopie, recital 28; and C-
521/11 - Amazon.com International Sales, recitals 25 et seq.). This is not at all the case in practice because
the application of levies on the merits and, if any, the applicable usually are only decided a long time after
the product has been sold which makes it impossible to include the appropriate amount in the sales price
and pass it through.

By way of a few examples only:

   (i)     there is still a litigation pending on copyright levy claims for PCs and printers in Germany for the
           years 2001 onwards, i.e. 13 years after they have been sold,

   (ii)    there has been not even a judgment of the court of first instance rendered yet on copyright levy
           claims for mobile phones in Germany for the years 2004 onwards, ten years after the sale,

   (iii)   after the German collecting societies never issued a tariff or other fixed claim towards the levy
           debtors on hard disc drives before, they issued a tariff in 2011 out of the blue, claiming amounts
           never mentioned before retroactively from 2008, this case just reached the court of first instance;

     (iv) in Austria, the highest Austrian court confirmed already in 2005 (Austrian Supreme Court,
          judgment of 12.07.2005, 4 Ob 115/05y - Gericom) that no levy shall be applied on PCs/internal
          hard discs, but now, nearly 9 years later decided to reconsider its judgment (cf. Austrian Supreme
          Court, judgment of 17.12.2013, 4 Ob 138/13t);

     (v) in Spain, many companies paid levies for many years (whereas other did not), just to learn that
         the Spanish system was not legal and there was no payment obligation;

     (vi) in France, the French upper administrative court issued a judgment stating that the tariffs are
          illegal, but still obliged the manufacturers to pay a levy for an interim period based on an illegal
          tariff (French Conseil d'Etat, decisions of 17.06.2011 N°324816, 325439, 325463, 325468 and
          325469).

There are many more examples.

To a certain degree, this is the fault of collecting societies who often take many years until they decide to
claim levies and, then, retroactively apply the levy to a product already on the market for a long time. For
obvious reasons, this practice of retroactively applying levies is clearly unjust and should be absolutely
prohibited.

However, putting this issue aside, there is a systematic problem which cannot be cured. Other than in the
analogue age in the 1960’s when levies were invented, there are new products, business models and
technologies on the market every year. Whether the levy amounts for a new product are set by the EU,
                                                            3



     member state bodies, specific bodies, or (worst) collecting societies themselves2, there must always be an
     effective legal possibility to challenge the levies in a constitutional legal system. It is no option to evaluate
     the hardware based levy system on the assumption that there is a possibility to set levies which nobody will
     be willing and will need to challenge. This will never be the case in practice; and it would not be
     constitutional.

     Even in the most efficient member state court systems, it takes many years to get a final and binding
     judgment of the highest court. In some cases it takes even much more than ten years. This means that only
     after a product has been launched and sold for 5-15 years the levy debtors will know which amount they
     should have added to the sales prices over the past 5-15 years. By this time, some of the products will not
     be sold anymore and some companies (levy debtors) may not even exist anymore. Even with respect to
     those products still sold, for 5 to 15 years the industry either included a hypothetical, too high amount
     (which will lead to too high and thus illegal charges to end-users) or a hypothetical, too low or no amount
     (which means that they have to illegally burden the financial consequences). Even reducing litigation times
     to 2-3 years (which is not realistic) would not solve the issue. In other words: As law of nature, the system
     cannot work in countries which guarantee respect for effective legal procedures. Only a compensation
     system which is not based on ever evolving and changing products could work. This cannot be hardware
     levies.

2.   Cloud and streaming age

     Just looking at the products currently on the market where levies are disputed (majority of the products,
     including PCs, tablets, mobile phones, hard discs, set-top-boxes, USB sticks and memory cards), it will still
     take many years until there will be the required certainty on

     (i) which products are subject to levies in which countries at all, and

     (ii) which amounts apply. By that time, the amount private copying done on hardware purchase by
          private end-users will be minimal or non existing. Already now, there is a strong movement to cloud
          services and streaming offerings. It does not make sense, is not in the interest of creators, and not fair
          to consumers and the hardware industry to invest time and resources to keep a system alive which does
          not work already today and which has no future.

3.   Inefficiencies and unequal treatment; unfairness to creators and consumers

     Irrespective of the non-curable issues mentioned above, a system where all involved parties (hardware
     industry, collecting societies, right holders organized in collecting societies) have to re-negotiate levies
     (collecting societies and industry) and the sharing of levy revenues (collecting societies amongst themselves
     and with right holders) every year due to the launch of new products, the changing use of one product (or

2
 Levy amounts unilaterally set by collecting societies lead to astronomic claims (such as 36 EUR for mobile phones in
Germany) which only serve as pressure for negotiations, but are never intended or possible to be reached. Obviously, such
moon tariffs cannot be used by any company to include a reasonable levy into the sales price.
                                                               4



       even only one parties view that the use has changed3) and/or a new court judgment can never be efficient.
       Necessary studies for every new product cost often a lot more than 100.000 €. This process automatically
       leads to levy amounts to be finally paid by consumers which are too high and/or profits from levy claims to
       be given to creators and right holders which are too low. The German ICT industry association BITKOM has
       calculated that in Germany a typically equipped household would have to spend EUR 396.04 if the levy
       rates claimed by the German collecting societies are applied, irrespective of whether it undertakes any
       private copying at all.4

       In addition, the collecting societies never approach all debtors, but usually focus on local (not foreign). A
       study shows that in Germany more than 70% of dealers/importers don´t know the collecting societies, ca.
       95% never got letter from them. Even one of the market leaders did not pay any levy and the collecting
       societies did not realize that over more than 10 years! To be fair, with new products and players on the
       market every year, this is maybe unavoidable to a certain extent. For more than 40 products the collecting
       societies claim levy. Just in Germany there are several thousand dealers and importers on the market. The
       result however is that the end-users of some products and some brands do not pay whereas others
       (over)pay. This is again the logical consequence of trying to transfer a system created for the analogue age
       into the fast moving digital and cloud age.

4.     Multifunctional use; unfairness to consumers and end-users

       When levies were introduced in the 1960’s on analogous audio and video recorders, there was the
       assumption that nearly every purchaser of analogous audio and video recorder used the product for private
       copying.5 It was viewed as fair to burden the purchasers of such analogue hardware with the increase of
       the product sales price by the levy amount. This private copying assumption for analogue hardware is not


3
 In 2005 the Austrian Supreme Court decided that no copyright levies are due for PCs as they are not used for private
copying to a relevant extent (cf. Austrian Supreme Court judgment of 12.07.2005, 4 Ob 115/05y – Gericom). In 2010 the
Austrian collecting societies claimed once again copyright levies on PCs stating that the use of PCs for private copying shall
have increased. After the claims have been dismissed in the first two instances, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the
case back to the lower courts for further fact finding in order to assess whether the use of PCs for private copying has
changed as suggested by the collecting societies (Austrian Supreme Court, judgment of 17.12.2013, 4 Ob 138/13t). In
Germany, collecting societies claim copyright levies (i) of up to EUR 2.56 per mobile phone sold until end of 2007, (ii)
between EUR 4.00 – 11.00 per mobile phone sold between 2008 and 2010 and (iii) copyright levies between EUR 12.00 –
36.00 per mobile phone sold as of 2011 (all claims are disputed and subject to court proceedings) asserting that the use of
mobile phones for private copying shall have increased during the years.

  Cf. expressly the reasoning of the German parliament when introducing levies in the new German Copyright Act in 1965 as
first country: “few exceptions”, “unlikely that … never used [for private copying]”, both referring not to a type of product,
but to every single unit and thereby every single end-user (see comments to art 54 in Drucksache IV/3401, 14.05.1965,
Schriftlicher Bericht des Rechtsausschusses, http://www.urheberrecht.org/law/normen/urhg/1965-09-
09/materialien/zuds_IV_3401.php3#top).
                                                               5



     at all true anymore for the vast majority of digital products for which levies are claimed today. PCs, tablets,
     phones, hard disc drives, memory cards, USB sticks etc. are used for various purposes, most are irrelevant
     for levies. The collecting societies even claim levies for every single copy, even those which are
     recommended by right holders (backup copy). The assumption that a hardware based levy is a proper
     vehicle to reach those consumers who undertake private copying is clearly not correct anymore. The only
     fair system is direct consumer licensing which can be controlled by the content providers. These
     remuneration systems are in use today by companies such as Apple and Spotify.

In result, there are many reasons which make it mandatory to stop hardware based levies. If at all a flat
compensation system shall be kept6, other ways need to be explored such as a charge on download or
streaming services7, a flat rate to be paid by every household 8, a levy on private internet access9, or a state
financed system10 or like in every retail trade: The dealer has to price in any loss (e.g. from larceny about 1%) .
Studies shows: The creator himself will get more money from such a system than by a hardware based levy. Any
of these systems would cause less legal issues, and would be fairer, be more efficient, more reasonable and
more transparent than the current hardware levy system. Transparency of the costs to end-users should also
be the aim of the European Union.

Political pressure or difficulties of a system change do not justify keeping a system which, by nature of law,
cannot work in a constitutional and EU-law compliant manner, and in addition is inefficient for right owners and
unfair to consumers and end-users.

The European Commission must therefore urgently take steps to abolish the unfair, inefficient, illegal and
outdated hardware based levy system.

6
  In our view, it should not be kept as the legal justification for its implementation in the analogous age (that copies cannot
be technically prevented and a flat compensation is better than no compensation) has gone and individual licensing models
are possible. If the content industry decides to sell products without DRM, this is their business decision which must not
lead to a burdening of the hardware industry or other intermediaries with a levy or other compensation system. If
politicians believe that creators are not sufficiently compensated, this has to be addressed in the relation between the
creator and the content industry respectively in copyright contract law, but not through the backdoor of flat compensations
to be claimed from of third parties.
7
  The providers of such services benefit from the free content as part of their business model. So, it is much fairer and
logical if they pay the compensation.
8
 Such system is already established and working in Germany for public broadcasting fees – households which do not have
the means to pay it can be released or subsidized by the respective member state.

9
  This would have the disadvantage that again a third party is burdened. However, contrary to hardware based levies, the
legal issues do not exist (easy distinction business-consumers; no new products every year; cloud and streaming does not
make a difference; not unfair to end-users as system is efficient; different use can be addressed by making the levy
dependent on speed of internet access), and it could be applied in a fair and transparent manner.
