                              REGISTER ID: 4456380381-30
        TYPE OF RESPONDENT: Representative of publishers/producers/broadcasters




Introduction

The European Publishers Council (EPC) brings together Chairmen and CEOs of Europe’s
leading media groups representing companies with newspapers, magazines, online
publishing, journals, databases, books and broadcasting, communicating with Europe’s
legislators since 1991 on issues that affect freedom of expression, media diversity,
democracy and the health and viability of media in the EU. A list of our members can be
found in annex.

The EPC welcomes the opportunity to comment on the questions set out in the
consultation. Individual companies, members of the EPC may also contribute directly to the
consultation.

The EPC has responded to the consultation with an open mind. In parallel, EPC has
undertaken work to produce a Vision Paper on Copyright, Technology and Practical
Solutions to build a copyright enabled digital market for the publishing and media
ecosystem. It will shortly be available and will complement our response to the
consultation, addressing additional issues beyond the consultation.
Executive Summary

1. The Single Market: importance of a holistic approach and the use of technology

EPC believes that it is necessary to take a holistic approach when addressing the issue of
why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe. A
wide range of issues that goes well beyond the concept of territoriality play a role when
deciding to offer a service on several markets. These include the lack of interoperability of
format standards, differing consumer laws, rules on defamation or libel, and a lack of easy,
cheap and secure micropayments transactions. Most critically though, we see no evidence
that the current copyright framework hinders the provision of cross border services; on the
contrary it remains the bedrock of an unparalleled innovation resulting in unprecedented
opportunities to provide services and access to all kinds of content in multiple formats
across many platforms and devices.

EPC remains strongly supportive of and convinced that the progress currently on-going
regarding the development of identifiers, interoperable metadata, interoperable
registries and hubs will play an ever increasing role in making content accessible to the
user, whether at home or across borders as these tools will make it easier to handle the
rights clearance procedure. Two key priorities for the EPC are:
    a) To continue the work initiated by the Linked Content Coalition, a cross media
        group of experts whose goal is to develop solutions on how to assert ownership of
        online content and of how to communicate copyright terms and conditions in the
        digital environment and to enable greater legitimate use of digital content
        through better management of data relating to rights across the network. The LCC
        recognizes that securing the highest possible level of automation in licensing will
        reduce barriers to entry, reduce cost in the supply chain, increase volume of use
        and encourage innovation.
    b) Seek clarification that legal recognition and protection of identifiers associated
        with a copy of a copyright work, or which appears in connection with the
        communication to the public of a copyright work, is covered by Article 7 of
        Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society
        as well as extending similar protection to databases which are protected by the
        EC’s sui generis database right.




                                                                            2
2. Linking & browsing: new usages may require legal adaptation

Technology makes a major contribution to the evolution of the media and publishing
ecosystem but it doesn't operate in a vacuum. It is our aim to work with and adapt to
technology in a way that benefits our direct user groups through investment in new R&D,
product and service development, and future revenue streams. There are however a
number of new situations emerging in the field of linking and browsing that may need
closer attention by policy makers:

Hyperlinking:
Press publishers encourage sharing of their content by their readers; this is often done
through the presence of share buttons to social media or by readers themselves providing
hyperlinks to their peer group.
However an increasingly common, business usage prompted by technology is the making
available for new, commercial purposes of hyperlinks to content that is protected by
copyright, in a systematic way by commercial organisations and for commercial gain.

The EPC calls for legal clarification as to why the provision of hyperlinks should be
compliant with license terms of websites (or other platforms) to which they link. It must
be clear at law that rights owners may by their licence terms define, or limit access to and
use of the content made available on an “open website”, i.e. not behind a pay-wall or
registration page. The fact that publishers invite free access to their websites by the
general public should not preclude prohibition of systematic scraping of that content via
hyperlinks Regardless if whether or not the content itself is accompanied by technical
protection measures.

Hyperlinking to illegal copies
An issue that is increasingly taking time and demands investment is action against
hyperlinking to illegal copies. A common pattern in copyright infringement cases is the
separation of the actual copyrighted material reproduced and stored without permission in
a cyber-locker and the posting of the hyperlink to such a pirated copy (as the only way to
access and download the content). Publishers spend large amounts of money and resources
to crawl the web to identify pirated copies, to send take down notices to owners of cyber-
lockers, with varying degrees of their cooperation, but have limited options to require the
removal of the posted links. The making available of a hyperlink to an infringing copy is the
single most prevalent act enabling piracy on a large scale.




                                                                            3
The EPC calls on the Commission to propose amendments to copyright law to treat as
infringements those acts of making available of hyperlinks to copies which are clearly and
obviously unlawfully obtained or obviously unlawfully made available to the public.

Snippets:
The unlicensed use of snippets derived from content on their websites by search engines
and aggregators, which, representing the distillation of press articles, substitutes for the
original article, results in substantial loss to the publishers of the original content and
must be addressed.

The EPC calls on the Commission to establish a fair framework to facilitate the making
available to commercial users of snippets on permissions- based system in partnership
with news media organisations and their authors1.



3. Download to own digital content: resell of digital files

Allowing the re-sale of downloaded content would constitute direct competition with and
substitution of the sale of the “original” work. This would lead to loss of revenue for the
author and right holder, and subsequently create unfair competition with the primary
market with significant and detrimental effect on the investments in new European content
and therefore to the provision of diverse European contents such as books, learning
materials, even magazine and premium newspaper content. Furthermore, enabling the
resale of previously purchased digital content would weaken the advertising market of the
press sector or create new unfair competition that would in practice be derived from the
publishers’ investment, which in time would lead to a diminished supply of that content
thereby operating against the consumer interest.

Post-purchase re-download: clarification for the benefit of the consumer experience
With the advent of cloud powered listening/reading, major service providers in the market
are offering all-time cloud access to previously purchased content. There is no longer one
single download to a user's hard-drive at the time of sale; instead the users validate their
credentials on a new device and get instant access to the entire portfolio of previously
purchased copies, which are automatically or upon request re-downloaded to such a user’s


1
  The fact that several European countries are taking action in this field is an indicator of the problem. For
example, in Germany a legislative framework has been established to address this issue in the field of news
media. In Spain a new legislative proposal announced in February 2014 will allow news media companies will
be able to charge search engines for displaying copyrighted content




                                                                                          4
device(s). In order to facilitate this service, the content provider must keep a master copy of
the digital good stored on its servers, create a copy and make such a copy available to the
user even though the original grant of rights from the author to the publisher has
expired/lapsed. In theory, the post-term copy could be considered a case of copyright
infringement committed by the vendor (and/or the publisher, if publisher grants rights here
fore).

A clarification in copyright law that post purchase re-download after a legal first sale is
not in violation of copyright even if the rights to sell have expired, would increase legal
certainty for rights holders, vendors and consumers alike and help to improve the
customer experience.



4. Registration of works and interoperable identifiers

The EPC would wish first to distinguish between registration of works in order to derive
copyright protection and the declaration of information about the identity of rightsholders
and terms and conditions of these works in order to facilitate licensing.

We would support all efforts to a) encourage well-structured databases to facilitate
declaration of rights and b) commonality in the way such declarations are made to promote
interoperability and accessibility across multiple media types, sectors and territories of such
information.

Digital availability of more and more content will lead inevitably to more databases and
registries. The information these databases and registries will contain is information
related to identifiers, metadata and the rights expressions. What is critical is that these
registries and databases are interoperable and can allow inter-communication and
federated searches, which will drive the development of licensing through easier
identification of rights holders, licensors and of content.

Increasingly creators and authors will be able to declare their rights in a work in standard,
authoritative ways which will lead to less confusion in cases of conflict resolution regarding
who is the author and who owns the right to a piece of work. This in addition to the
developments of hubs and exchanges, databases and registries that are interoperable, will
make content more easily discoverable.

The EPC calls on the European Commission to provide incentives directed at industry
sectors to provide them with means to start projects that will help with implementation



                                                                             5
of the above mentioned ongoing developments. Also to raise awareness of the
importance of such initiatives for licensing, increased access to content and the growth of
the European content industry. To be successful, this process must however be developed
and implemented at scale by the industry and the creative sector, and be global in its
reach.

5. Limitations & exceptions: an efficient user-oriented approach

The current list of optional exceptions and limitations was agreed in order to allow Member
States to continue to allow for exceptions already in place in their country, exceptions and
limitations that are strongly linked to their creative and cultural heritage, and which form
part of the European cultural diversity.

The EPC considers that the exceptions as they are currently defined do accommodate the
digital environment. However, the EPC is not per see against further harmonisation in
making certain existing exceptions mandatory to apply equally across the EU, on the
condition that this is justified by a thorough impact assessment, and that any such
provisions would not seek to broaden the scope of the current exceptions, would be
narrowly framed and would not conflict with the three-step test of the Berne convention.
Additionally and specifically because of the changing nature of content consumption and
the very wide scale availability of commercial content services, it is perhaps necessary to
undertake a broader reflexion of the necessary balance between the role of public
institutions, such as public libraries, and the access to content provided by the creative
industry in the digital environment when it comes to considering exceptions in this field.

Regarding whether greater flexibility in the field of exceptions and limitations should be
introduced, through an open norm style exception, this would seem to go against the legal
certainty that Europe is striving for, in the case of creators, right holders and users. Europe
would be better positioned to reach a dynamic flexibility for increased uses by providing
incentives to small scale licensing, both B2B and B2C, and automated licensing solutions.
As presented in the User Generated Content Working Group 2, Web Content Declarations
would also help users to increasingly be remunerated and monetise their user generated
created content should they so wish2.

The EPC calls for a user oriented approach: should the aim be to make content
increasingly accessible to the user (consumer, researcher, public institution) for uses such
as text and data mining, or to use parts of protected content to create new content (‘user

                                                                                           6
generated content’), priority should be given to solutions put forward by the creative
industry to make access and use ofcontent as easy as possible3. Further input and
dialogue with the user community is key to understand their needs. In the field of
teaching EPC welcomes the approach taken by DG EAC in Opening up Education to
enhance the transparency on what teachers can and can not do with the content they
wish to use in their teaching.

6. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EPC believes that this issue should be discussed at the level closest to the parties at
national level to find the most adequate solution. Regulatory approaches in Member States
differ as well as approaches in the various content sectors. However in the field of news
media publishing, an important part of the work of a news media company in countries
where work for hire provisions do not exist, is to clear the rights of a multitude of
contributors, whether employed journalists, freelance journalists and photographers, both
for the first publication but also for subsequent exploitations such as archives, or when
formerly published content needs to be re-used again in the prime news section.

7. Respect of rights

To ensure that Europe has vibrant and attractive legal online content offers that reflect the
European richness in the high quality professional content production, the civil
enforcement system needs to be rendered more efficient when it comes to tackling online
piracy.

Despite the positive benefits of the implementation of the 2004/48/EC directive, the
challenges to fight piracy online have grown even bigger. This question needs to be tackled
in the light of the e-Commerce Directive (2001/31/EC), in particular the liability provisions
and notice and takedown procedures.

Online piracy affecting the content sector can take different forms depending on the
various content sectors. Typically in the field of publishing the B2B piracy is often the major
issue, where search engines index, copy, aggregate content and provide links without prior

permission. As mentioned in our response in the linking and browsing part, hyperlinking to
illegal copies and making available of legal content without permission for commercial use
are both increasingly a problem and may require an adaptation to the legal framework.

Reflexions on fast track procedures should be encouraged, accompanied by efficient notice
and take down procedures.

The EPC is currently involved in the work related to development of identifiers and
interoperable rights expression langue and metadata standards. The involvement of
platforms and ISPs in such projects involving machine-readable licences in particular would
be helpful and would favour the creation of a sustainable content market.4

8. EU Copyright Title: what is the aim for a creative Europe?

The EU can pursue further harmonisation without the establishment of an EU copyright
title. It also remains doubtful which legal basis would serve for such a purpose and whether
such a purpose would be necessary and proportionate to achieve its aim. If the overall aim
is to create a vibrant European creative and content market reflecting the rich cultural
diversity existing in Europe, the aim of the European Commission should be to reflect on an
overall long term industrial policy setting the right framework for the creative sectors.

Although the EPC is not ideologically opposed to a unitary title, its doubtful whether a
single EU copyright title would help the diverse European content market to thrive or
whether such a framework would favour the possibility for other market players, not
necessarily in the business of creating professionally created quality content, to deploy
their activities further. It is unsure if this would help boosting Europe’s creative sector in
terms of employment and creative output.

From a pragmatic perspective there are other more pressing issues, especially in the area of
rights declarations, hubs and exchanges to bring more licensing automation, that call for
consideration and involvement.

     I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.        Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
          Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of
the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of
national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the
existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the
rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis
under national law5.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music
streaming service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an
authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the
public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European
licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial
licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management6 should significantly
facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services7; the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”8 and market-led developments such
as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition9.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability,
i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their
commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border
portability10.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and
access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online

   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                           9
services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live.
Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems
when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same”
service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across
borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same"
service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their
country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated
with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end
users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium
term11 to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market,
while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.        [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
          trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which
          you live?


2.        [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
          to provide online services across borders in the EU?
NO
The nature of the publishing business is to provide access to published content wherever
the reader is located, for a public that almost always reads in the local language in which
the content is produced, to favor freedom of the press and the dissemination of
professionally published content. This is especially true for the news media publishing
sector, as well as for magazine publishing, which before the Internet era already had
physical distribution agreements at international level, and subscription possibilities with
postal delivery to many, if not all, countries.
While publishers licence their primary rights internationally for their publications, in the
field of secondary rights such as press clipping services, the Press Database and Licensing
Network (PDLN) aims to deliver licensing solutions for international delivery of press
information for media monitoring services.
The book publishing (trade publishing in particular) sector operates by granting worldwide
rights for a specific language version. There may be some territorial restrictions for the UK
and US markets, as these two countries are considered separate markets in relation to
marketing and distribution. The book publishing market is highly related to the local
language, and sometimes publishers may not deliver physical copies of books to certain

     For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing
a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.



                                                                                      10
countries, not because of copyright, but because their agreement with the postal operator
may only cover certain countries etc. where they know that there is a sufficient demand in
order to justify the setup of physical delivery towards certain countries. Additional issues
such as national consumer laws that may differ can be an additional reason why delivery to
other countries is not ensured. Digital development and the availability of reading devices
have however created unprecedented possibilities for readers to acquire books in e-book
format across borders.
Generally the provision of access to online content and news media services across borders
happens through the negotiation and granting of licences because there is consumer
demand justifying such an investment. For example an EPC member that acquired the web
TV rights to the top football league (in Norway) negotiated a licence allowing holders of
Norwegian credit cards or Norwegian ID numbers to access the content outside Norway.
Thus cross border access was provided to respond to the specific demand to ‘travel with
your content’ and to allow Norwegians living abroad to access the content. Acquisition of
the web TV rights or other content rights is always an investment in the content by the
broadcaster or publisher to provide public access to the professional content. Investments
always require a sufficient income to the broadcaster/publisher in return.
Rather than a copyright ‘problem’, territoriality is often the consequence of a business
decision to serve the markets where there is a consumer demand.
One way of improving accessibility of content across borders in particular by helping service
providers to set up such services is to work on initiatives allowing for rights to be easily
discoverable, and licensed such as through the adoption of identifiers so that rights owners
and licensors can be found easily through interoperable databases / registries12.
As an additional point, in relation to clearing of rights in the news media publishing area, as
well as in the magazine publishing area, the employer’s copyright regime, i.e. like the one in
the Netherlands and the UK, provides an easy solution to make sure that the copyrights are
cleared in all cases also for cross-border online services. In other countries, in most cases,
either all copyrights (incl. rights to transfer the rights and amend the work) are acquired in
the contracts of employment and freelancer agreements or sufficient online rights are
licensed/acquired in the freelancer and other agreements to provide online
publications/services cross-border. Due to language, territoriality has not raised issues for
press/entertainment content.


3.          [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
            How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
            possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
            Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
EPC members may respond to this question directly in their individual contributions to the
consultation.

                                                                                         11
4.       If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
         what would be the best way to tackle them?
As mentioned in the responses to the previous questions, the EPC believes that the best
way to tackle these issues is to support market led solutions, in particular based on the
uptake by the creative industry of identifiers and interoperable metadata describing the
content, who owns the rights and where licensors can be found via interoperable databases
making rights acquisition easier and thus content more discoverable through licensed
services.
Overall, publishing is happening cross-border, and even more so with digital.
However there are issues that go beyond the concept of territoriality that may justify why a
service provider does choose not to enjoy the principle of freedom to provide a service. For
example, a service provider may choose to use geolocation software to make sure that the
content is available in the countries for which the provider has acquired a licence (this
happens in the music and film sector); the identity of the users is then linked to either i.e. IP
addresses or payment cards. Moreover in the field of online payment systems, and for
micro transactions in particular, it is key that it is financially sustainable to use such online
payment systems, and that such systems are secure. Furthermore, lack of interoperability
of format standards, differing national consumer laws, rules on defamation, libel and
privacy are additional areas that play a role when providing a service on a new market.
The current growth and success of the online/digital game industry is a good example of
cross-border content services that are based on the employer’s copyright regime (as is the
prevailing case in Europe regarding software). The online/digital game industry showcases
well the fact that the party who carries the business risks of content investments for new
online content products/services (like the publishers do) should receive the copyright as
smoothly as possible supported for example by the employer’s copyright regime.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
       there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
       territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
       territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that
       access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
YES
There are areas that are not related to copyright which may sometimes justify why a service
provider does choose not to enjoy the principle of freedom to provide services, such as
differing national consumer laws, rules on defamation, libel and privacy. These two areas,
not harmonised due to specific reasons, may create legal uncertainty, and thus providers
refrain from providing services across borders. A service provider may for commercial
reasons not want to deploy marketing efforts, in areas where this is necessary for a service
to take off, to some countries where there is little consumer demand.




                                                                               12
6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
       why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
       territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
       territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the
       consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
YES
See answer to question 5.


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
       market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
       availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
       level of protection for right holders?
YES
A market-led approach is a prerequisite in this area. If this is not the case, any legislative or
policy initiative imposing rules that affect a sound business organisation may impact
adversely innovation, employment and growth. The digital environment is a growth
opportunity for the creative industry, and what will drive this growth is to serve and
respond to the rising consumer demand.
The European Commission can encourage market-led solutions such as via the Licenses for
Europe process, and may also help by supporting projects aiming to make it easier for the
end user and businesses to find content, such as projects in the field of identifiers and
interoperable metadata standards. This will make rights clearance smoother which is key
when offering services whether at national, multinational or pan-European basis.
A key priority for EPC is to continue the work in this field undertaken by the
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org and the www.rdi-project.eu
Additionally, as previously mentioned, other areas play a role, such as efficient and secure
micropayment systems for low value high volume transactions that occur in the publishing
and media sector, and ensuring that there is an overall healthy market situation among the
various players providing services on the web.

B.      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to
        be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
1.      [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC13 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU
directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the
protection of software14 and databases15.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders16
which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies17, (notably relevant at the start of the
transmission – e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it
available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and
the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or
prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks18. These rights are intrinsically
linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.      The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g.
the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the
act of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a
single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories
and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of
the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in
each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law
of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the

13
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation
of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
14
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
15
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
16
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other
subject matter”.
17
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction
of a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC).
18
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).



                                                                                           14
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public19. According to this approach the copyright-
relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are
“targeted” by the online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers
residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8.         Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
           content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
Yes/No
Copyright law is based on the principle of territoriality in the sense that a State cannot
prescribe legal rules such as copyright law to govern activities outside its national borders.20
That is why the Berne Convention introduces the concept of ‘national treatment’ to give
protection under a country’s copyright law for a foreign work. It also brings with it the need
to have legal rules to determine the territorial location of a copyright act such as ‘making
available’ a work, which national law applies to an act of exploitation, and a mechanism to
deal with situations where the same act (e.g. ‘making available’) is treated for copyright
purposes as occurring in more than one territory.
This is the subject of much academic research and is also dealt with extensively in the Study
commissioned by the EC from De Wolf & Partners to support the EC Consultation (“the De
Wolf Study”).
This question is closely linked to the issue of competent jurisdiction and applicable law; to
determine either a country of origin approach or an exploitation/“targeted” approach, may
have an impact on the applicable law. In principle a country of origin approach to
determine the localisation of the making available act could favour forum shopping and the
provider could potentially chose a forum (place of establishment, transmission etc) which
has a lower level of protection. This could have an impact on the level of protection for the
rightsholder in case of infringement.
On this complex issue, any further work that the Commission may undertake should avoid
impacting negatively the way that rightsholders may enforce their rights.
The EPC would also like to state that technology can increasingly accommodate all parties
in cases of cross border dissemination of content while fully respecting copyright principles.




19
     See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
20
     This principle was affirmed in the ECJ’s ruling in Lagadere.



                                                                                           15
9.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
        of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights
        (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
        considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the
        enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief21)?
YES / NO
Any clarification of the territorial scope should not impact negatively the enforcement of
rights by the rights holder.


2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate
the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
        rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
        download) create problems for you?
YES
In practice, in the field of publishing, rights are acquired in such a way that this question
does not really arise. However in countries that do not have an employers’ copyright right it
is key that they acquire either all copyrights (incl. rights to transfer the rights and amend
the work) in the contracts of employment and freelancer agreements or at least sufficient
rights to cover the two sets of right to be able to exploit the work within the publication.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to
another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several
cases are pending before the CJEU22 in which the question has been raised whether the
provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making
available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies
of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the
'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU23 as to whether


21
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.
22
    Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).
23
   Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See also
http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.



                                                                                   16
such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
       protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
       subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
Press publishers encourage sharing of their content by their readers; this is often done
through the presence of share buttons or by readers themselves providing hyperlinks.
However, when the provision of hyperlinks is exploited in a systematic way by commercial
organisations and the provision of such clickable links is used for commercial gain, this
should be subject to authorisation.
Providing such clickable links creates an act of communication to the public/making
available of the copyrighted work.
In particular following the Svensson/Retriever case (C-466-12) legal clarification is needed
as to why the provision of hyperlinks should be compliant with licence terms of the
websites (or other platforms) to which they link. It must be clear that rights owners may by
their licence terms define, or limit access to and use of, content on an “open website” to a
specific category of “the public” (e.g. users who visit the site directly), whether
accompanied or not by technical protection measures. Otherwise there will be less
professional press content available for free (i.e. without payment) for users in Europe, as
the publishers will need to protect their professional press content through speeding up the
building of paywalls, etc. There should be no legal possibility in Europe to benefit from
commercial gain by re-using, in online content services, the others’ (such as publishers’)
content investments without a permission and/or payment.
Hyperlinking to illegal copies: A common pattern in copyright infringement cases is the
separation of the actual copyrighted material reproduced and stored without permission in
a cyber-locker and the posting of the hyperlink to a pirated copy (as the only way to access
and download the content). Publishers spend high amounts of money and resources to
crawl the web for pirated copies, to send take down notices to cyber-lockers, with varying
degrees of cooperation, but have limited options to require removal of the posted links.
The making available of a hyperlink to an infringing copy is the single greatest act enabling
piracy on a large scale – and copyright law should thus be amended to treat as
infringements those acts of making available hyperlinks to copies which are clearly and
obviously unlawfully-produced or obviously unlawfully made available to the public. In this
context, it is worth noting that Article 53 German Copyright Act already successfully uses
such terminology.
Regarding unlicensed use of snippets: the unlicensed use of snippets derived from content
on their websites by search engines and aggregators, as the distillation of articles, may
substitute for the original article and result in substantial losses to the publishers of the
original content.




                                                                            17
In Germany, the ‘Leistungssschutzrecht fur Presseleger’ was introduced in 2013. The
purpose of the legislation is to ensure that publishers in the online market are not placed at
a disadvantage relative to other aggregators of works. We recommend that consideration is
given to providing publishers in other member states equivalent legal protection to that
conferred by the Leistungssschutzrecht fur Presseleger’.


12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction
       of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
       the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
       circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
YES
The reference to general or specific circumstances in the question lies at the heart of the
issue, and the exception in article 5.1 of the 2001/29/EC Directive needs to be carefully
measured against article 5.5 of the same Directive (three step test), and should only apply
in certain cases:
1. Temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or incidental
[and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to
enable: (a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or (b) a
lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent
economic significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article
2.
In general press publishers want readers to be able to visit their website, browse and read
the content that the publisher choses to make available, and want this process to work in a
seamless manner by granting the screen/cache copy as an implied licence.
These types of copies will be increasingly relevant in our digital future, and perhaps it could
be useful to clarify whether such an act of communication is related to business activities or
a nonprofit activity; if the act of communication to the public is random or if the business
idea is entirely based on the systematic act of communication to the public of materials. It
could be helpful for the European publishing business to clarify the difference between
direct or indirect use of communication to the public for commercial or non commercial
purposes.
Additionally, we would like to refer to the decision of the UK’s Supreme Court in Public
Relations Consultants Association Limited vs. The Newspaper Licensing Agency Limited
which shows how members states’ Courts are getting to grips with intersection of
technology and copyright. In this case, the Court dealt with the application of Article 5.1 of
the InfoSoc Directive to analyse the copyright status of copies made on an end user’s
computer screen and in the internet cache when browsing. Applying the acquis in Infopaq I
&II, the Premier League case and other cases, the Supreme Court concluded that these
copies made by the user’s computer fell within the exception. The Supreme Court’s
decision is now the subject of a referral to the EUCJ. The case demonstrates two things: -
(1) copyright law does not “break” the Internet but (2) the way technology operates means



                                                                             18
that it takes time and care in drawing the legal boundary between copyright-restricted acts
and copyright exceptions. Whilst the general proposition that Internet browsing does not
require a licence is reasonable, there remains a risk that an overly broad interpretation
could mean that activities which ought properly to be licensable (e.g. the consumption of
press cuttings) might cease to be so.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the
further distribution of that tangible article)24. The issue that arises here is whether this
principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to
distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)25. This raises difficult
questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often
referred to as the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in
contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
         trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
14.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
         consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
         purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
In the field of book publishing however, the impact of reselling a digital e-book file would
clearly impact negatively the right holder, due to the fact that the digital copy is perfect and
moreover limitless, and that the revenue that the seller would gain from the resell would
not necessarily benefit the rightsholder. While in the physical distribution scheme, one
may pay less for a second hand book as its cover and pages are used and the work is overall
less well preserved and is not a perfect substitute, the contrary is the case of a digital copy.
Thus allowing reselling would constitute direct competition to the sale of the “original” e-
book, leading to loss of revenue for the author and rightsholder. This would and
subsequently create competition with the primary market with significant and detrimental
effect to investments in new European content and therefore to the provision of diverse
24
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
25
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).



                                                                                             19
European content such as novels, learning materials, and even magazine and premium
newspaper content. Enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content would
weaken the advertising market of the press or create new competition that would be in
practice based on the publishers’ content investment, thereby operating against consumer
interest.

For that reason, EPC supports a more restricted interpretation of the scope of the
exhaustion principle.

In terms of recent case law, the German regional court of Bielefeld did not apply the
UsedSoft case law in a case involving e-books and whether the principle of exhaustion
applies to re-sale of ebooks. The German court held that because of the nature of the EU
Software Directive 2009/24/EC as lex specialis to the EU Information Society Directive
2001/29/EC, the reasoning in UsedSoft (distribution of computer programmes) could not be
applied to other subject-matter. Additionally in the USA the situation is quite clear as
demonstrated in the case of Capitol Records LLC v ReDigi, Inc26 that the US doctrine of
“first sale” does not apply to digital content.

However there is one issue in this context that merits attention as it impacts the consumer
experience, but does not economically harm the rightsholder, and that is post-purchase re-
download. The current status of copyright should be clarified to improve legal certainty for
all stakeholders and improve the consumer experience in new use cases with regard to
post-purchase re-download (including post-termination of the rights agreement).

In the past, users have purchased a digital good and downloaded it once onto their systems,
with the entitlement for personal, non-commercial perpetual use. They could thus create
backup copies, store those on their hard drives (or in their personal cloud storage) and load
the copy onto their digital devices for consumption when needed. The vendor thus only
required a valid license at the time of sale. No problems occurred once the rights (e.g. from
the author agreement) lapsed after a certain amount of time – the work was simply
excluded from further sale.

With the advent of cloud listening/reading, major vendors in the markets are offering all-
time cloud access to previously purchased content. There is no longer one single download
to a user's hard-drive at the time of sale, instead the user validates its user credentials on a
new device and gets instant access to the entire portfolio of previously purchased copies,
which are automatically or upon request downloaded to the user’s device(s).

In order for this, the vendor must keep a master copy of the digital good stored on its
servers and create a copy and make such a copy is available to the user even after the
original grant of rights from the author to the publisher has expired/lapsed. In theory, the
post-term copy could be considered a case of copyright infringement committed by the
vendor (and/or the publisher, if publisher grants rights here fore). However, economically,

26
     USDC, 2013



                                                                              20
no harm is done if the original rights holder has received due remuneration at the time of
the sale (similar to the previous, pure download scenario). A clarification in copyright law
that such a re-download after a sale is not in violation of copyright even if the rights to sell
have expired would increase legal certainty for rights holders and vendors alike and help to
improve the customer experience.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international
treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute27. Moreover a system of registration does
not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities
that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works
that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a
system of registration are increasingly being considered28.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
        and licensing of works and other subject matter?
NO
16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
We would first wish to make a distinction between registration of works in order to derive
copyright protection and the declaration of information about the identity of rightholders
and terms and conditions of these works in order to facilitate licensing. We would support
all efforts to a) encourage well-structured databases to facilitate declaration of rights and b)
commonality in the way such declarations are made to promote interoperability and
accessibility of such information.
Digital availability of content will lead inevitably to more databases and registries; this is the
way in which information about ownership, rights to content and licensors needs to be
organised in order that rights data information is accessible in an efficient way to facilitate
the making available of digital content. What is key is that these registries and databases
are well structured, interoperable and can support exchanges and licensing through supply
chains.
The Linked Coalition Content, a cross media group of experts whose goal is to develop
solutions to how to assert ownership of online content and of how to communicate
copyright terms and conditions in the digital environment and to enable greater legitimate
use of digital content through better management of data relating to rights across the
network. The LCC recognises that securing the highest possible level of automation in
27
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
28
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently
being set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan
works.



                                                                                          21
licensing will reduce barriers to entry, reduce cost in the supply chain, increase volume of
use and encourage innovation. The LCC’s goals will be enhanced by greater levels of rights
declaration.
Increasingly creators and authors will be able to declare their rights to content in an
authoritative way which will lead to less confusion and aid conflict resolution regarding who
is the author and who owns the right to a piece of work. Supported by the development of
hubs, databases and registries that are interoperable will make information about content
more easily discoverable.
To be successful, this process must however be adopted and implemented by the industry
and the creative sectors, and be global in its reach (not limited to EU). Political support for
these initiatives fosters common understanding of the benefits and aids take up throughout
the industry.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
As mentioned in the response to question 16, the EPC believes that the registration of
metadata and rights expressions will help the development of licensing and wider
accessibility to content. We do not see any disadvantages with such a development.


18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
The European Commission can provide incentives directed at industry sectors to provide
them with means to start projects that will help the above mentioned development already
ongoing, as well as raise awareness on the importance of such initiatives for licensing,
increased access to content and the growth of the European content industry.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed29, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database30 should, once operational,
provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition31 was established to develop building blocks for

29
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings; the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types.
It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data
model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub32 is seeking to
take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling
automated licensing across different sectors.

19.     What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
        sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and
        permissions databases?
The EU can have a valuable role to play in raising awareness around the importance of
identifiers and by providing funding of projects such as the Rights Data Integration Project,
ARROW etc. By initiating processes such as Licenses for Europe the European Commission
has brought around the table a number of stakeholders and during the dialogue it was
widely recognised in several working groups that the work on identifiers is important in the
creation of a digital content market. This was particularly felt in working groups 2 and 3 in
the Licences for Europe process.
It would be valuable if the European Commission could increasingly set aside funding to
stimulate and support the content industry’s technological development.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be
freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights).
The Berne Convention33 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death
of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the
author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term
provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international
agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication.
Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an
extended term of protection.


20.     Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
        environment?

YES
The term of protection is as valid in the digital environment as in the physical environment.
It represents the possibility and incentive for the creator to make the content available and

to ensure a livelihood from its creation. The EC consultation document does not put
forward reasons or arguments why the term of protection should not be appropriate in the
digital age. The digital environment presents unprecedented possibilities of accessing
content, and innovative licensing solutions serving the users, both consumers and business,
are only increasing.
In the field of publishing the EPC does not see a need for any changes in this area.

     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and
other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an
extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a
number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC34.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect
international law35. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires
that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not
conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)36, these limitations
and exceptions are often optional37, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of
certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do
so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the
EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms
of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an
effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and
exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a
Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to
the Member State "B")38.

and related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-



                                                                                            24
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to
compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their
rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for
such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration
in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should
determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best
mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when
necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that
for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States
regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the
functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.     Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
        provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
YES/NO
The current list of optional exceptions and limitations has been agreed in order to allow
Member States to continue to allow for exceptions already in place in their country,
exceptions and limitations that are strongly linked to their creative and cultural heritage,
which form part of the European cultural diversity. The EPC considers that the exceptions as
they are currently defined do accommodate the digital environment. However, the EPC is
not per se against further harmonisation in making certain existing exceptions mandatory,
on the condition that this is justified by a thorough impact assessment, and that any such
provisions would not seek to broaden the scope of the current exceptions, are narrowly
framed and do not conflict with the three-step test of the Berne convention.

22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
        for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 YES /NO
As indicated in the response to the previous question any such harmonisation and
mandatory requirement should be considered carefully, an impact assessment would need
to be provided and such a harmonisation should not affect the scope of the exception, to
avoid any conflict with the three step test.



border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.



                                                                                         25
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
       existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
The current list is exhaustive and there is no need to add any new exceptions. Perhaps the
way to look at this is to examine which exceptions may benefit from being introduced in
Member States that have not yet introduced some of them, or as indicated above examine
if there is a need for making some of the exceptions mandatory to respond to a clear and
evidence based internal market need.

24.   Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
      degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
NO
The 1976 US Copyright Act introduced a certain flexibility by the introduction of fair use of a
copyrighted work for purposes of reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other
means specified by that section for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching, scholarship or research. It is important to note that this list is not exhaustive.
The act specifies the factors to be considered whether a use is fair: a) the purpose and
character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for non-profit
educational purposes, b) the nature of the copyrighted work, c) the amount and
substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and d) the
effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The US courts then apply these factors in their analysis of the case. The extensive fair use
case law has also allowed limitations to copyright involving market considerations that
would probably not have been allowed in civil law jurisdictions.
The UK fair dealing provision to which this question also seems to refer, is much more
restrictive and provides more robust qualifications than the US “fair use”, which is not
limited (non exhaustive list) to the types of uses, or types of works. An important
appreciation is given to the US courts where social benefit, transformative use etc. seem to
take an important part in the evaluation.
It would seem problematic for Europe to take on a US “fair use” approach mainly because
copyright is not entirely harmonised in the EU, only those parts of copyright that are
needed for internal market purposes, but also to ensure that Member States fully enjoy
their competence in the field of culture; Europe also counts a number of civil law
jurisdictions.
If flexibility means a fair use style exception subject to case law interpretation as in the US,
this type of flexibility would create legal uncertainty, which is not desirable for European
right holders, already struggling with enforcing their rights in an online environment often
in multiple jurisdictions. In Europe, where markets are different, in many cases national,
and where there is strong cultural diversity, it would not be desirable for right holders to be
subject to yet another exception that would not be clearly and narrowly defined. The
current exceptions already give important latitude for users.




                                                                              26
Perhaps some exceptions could be subject to further harmonisation but only if this is
required for the functioning of the internal market.
An open norm style exception would seem to go against the legal certainty that Europe is
striving for both for creators, right holders and users.
Europe would be better positioned to reach a dynamic flexibility for increased uses by
providing incentives to small scale licensing, both B2B and B2C, and automated licensing
solutions. Moreover as presented in the User Generated Content Working Group 2 by
Godfrey Rust, creators who upload their creations directly to the web would benefit from a
system of Web Content Declaration at the point of entry to the network to provide
identifiers to help keep track of usage, and monetise their user generated created content
should        they     so      wish.      See      http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-
dialogue/en/content/wg2-presentations-6th-meeting-25-october

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
       interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
       interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use
       or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would
       be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its
       possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.


26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
       a problem?


NO
Territoriality of exceptions and limitations is not a major problem for EPC members. As
expressed by several members, the real problem is enforcement - from the very first stage
of finding out who the infringer is, finding out who to write to and, if material is not taken
down after a cease and desist letter, this renders the cost of taking action further
disproportionate. This point is illustrated more in detail in the part of the consultation
dealing with enforcement.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
       have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
       addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
       whom, where?)

A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow



                                                                            27
acts of preservation and archiving39 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other
subject matter in the collections of such institutions40. The public lending (under an
exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other
subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive41.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their
national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary
establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make).
Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and
archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.


28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
        problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
        or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 YES
The mission of libraries and education establishments is to fulfil their public interest mission
such as preservation, archiving, teaching, on site consultation, lending etc. As with public
service broadcasters this needs to be defined and limited to a clear remit so as not to harm
a viable commercial market; this is especially important in the digital environment where
business models are providing access to a multitude of content.
The recently adopted Orphan Works Directive has solved an important issue raised by
libraries as a major obstacle to their public interest mission, in particular their preservation
activities. For rightsholders the Directive addresses a key problem, namely that libraries’
digitisation activities do not erroneously include works under copyright protection, by the
39
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
40
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

   Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.



                                                                              28
establishment of a diligent search procedure and other safeguards such as fair
compensation if the orphan works status is put to an end. Moreover the Orphan Works
directive allows the making available for cultural and educational access, thus responding to
the libraries request for a solution to a key issue in their digital public interest activities.


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The approach that has been chosen by the European Union is to deal with these questions
on a case by case basis, i.e. the Orphan Works Directive and the MoU on out of commerce
works.
A key requirement of libraries in the physical environment is to provide access to Europe’s
considerable body of creative output. But as business models are evolving in the digital
sphere it may be that public libraries are no longer needed to provide access to everything.
Any additional usage granted to libraries must not go beyond what is necessary to ensure
their public interest mission. The digital environment imposes the necessity of finding a
delicate balance that does not impede publishers’ commercial activities, and their
economic ability to provide professionally produced content to Europe’s citizens and
businesses.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under which conditions?

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other
subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on
the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The
online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user
is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather
than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting
online access to collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
       problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
       to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
       thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in



                                                                              29
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of
research and private study?

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under which conditions?

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
On this particular question, a solution needs to be contractual. This is currently the case as
there is a vibrant commercial market for in particular educational publishers in this field,
thus providing for an exception would harm existing contractual arrangements and stifle
further innovation in a profitable European sector. The fact that contractual solutions to
this issue do exist shows that there is no market failure, and no justification for an
exception. The notions of “research and private study” to “members of the individual
public” are quite large, and it would be difficult to impose limits should remote access be
included in a general exception. The risk that this would hurt the normal exploitation of the
right holder is real and great.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities.
In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with
different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply
of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
       trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
       including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?



                                                                            30
37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

On this issue there needs to be a thorough assessment of the situation and clear
identification of any actual problems before considering specific solutions. In principle e-
book lending by libraries, provided that it is clearly limited with adequate protection
measures and limitations so as not to hurt the vibrant commercial model and market of e-
books, should be able to co-exist with publishers’ commercial model. Naturally the number
of users that can borrow the book needs to be limited to reflect the physical environment,
as the duration of the available file, and any copying, printing etc would need to be
restricted/prohibited.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one
(n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
       management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
       subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

39.    [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
       libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending
       and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-
       lending? What problems have you encountered?
A key requirement of libraries in the physical environment is to provide access to Europe’s
considerable body of creative output. But as business models are evolving in the digital
sphere it may be that public libraries are no longer needed to provide the access to
everything.      Any additional usage granted to libraries must not go beyond what is
necessary to ensure their public interest mission. The digital environment imposes the
necessity of finding a delicate balance that does not impede publishers’ commercial
activities and their economic ability to provide professionally produced content to Europe’s
citizens and businesses. Any extension whether implicit or not to libraries’ role in the
provision of digital content to the European public will likely lead to detrimental
consequences for the availability of new professional published European content, and
create a stronger publicly funded competitor to European publishers.

4.     Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections
with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to
the public. Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th
century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly
addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works



                                                                              31
which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to
facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence
agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the
collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other42. Provided the
required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this
MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for
instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is
based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis
of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need
to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing
in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of
an “extended effect” to the licences granted)43.

40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
        digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it
        be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the
        2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting
        societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be
        accessed across the EU?
NO
Whether Member States consider it necessary or not to enact legislation to ensure the
cross border effect, the key point to consider should be the guidance provided for in the
MoU, notably Principle No 3 regarding cross-border uses.
Exchange of repertoires between RRO’s would seem to be a solution to consider. It should
however be noted that for many local languages the cross border effect would have little
impact; however for English language versions, or other more commonly spoken languages
the question may be viewed differently.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
        other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
        archives)?
 NO OPINION




42
         You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
43
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting
society in relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.



                                                                                          32
B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC44 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his
course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the
classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain
authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision
allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of
the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.
Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

42.        (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
           experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter
           for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
 YES
In general the EPC considers that this exception is sufficiently digitally adapted. However
should it be proven necessary to clarify the current scope to take into account for example
distance learning, this needs to be narrowly defined not to risk the e-learning licence
model, and thus jeopardise the development of quality educational material. Some
consideration may be given to local collective licensing solutions where parties agree on the
scope of the licence.
There are however areas where progress can be made and results delivered without
necessarily opening up a discussion on the current exception. Teachers are not only bound
by curricula to deliver the right learning experience, they are also seeking inspiration for
content outside the curricula to enhance the learning environment. The EPC believes that
work can be done in order to enhance the transparency on what teachers can and cannot
do with the content they wish to use in their teaching. We are looking forward to working
with DG EAC on this specific area related to exception and present solutions to deliver the
framework that teachers may need.

44.        What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
           illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
EPC members active in this field offer a number of solutions in this area. By way of example
Pearson proposes a solutions ranging from the K12 market to the higher education market
where e-books can be customised for universities thus enhancing the learning outcome.
Tools for distance learning are also available through Pearson Learning Studio allowing
teachers to create, store and share learning content for their students.
In Finland an extended collective licence scheme for educational purposes agreed between
the rights holders and the CMO in 2011. The scope ECL License has been agreed by the
relevant right holders. The terms of the licence are balanced and do not compete with the
direct licensing of educational or press publishers. The license is restricted to a limited use
for example regarding the amount of pages/and number of pupils, the possibility to include
extracts in teachers’ power point slides / ancillary material only, as well as no right to
communicate works to the public in the open internet.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC46 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 47.

The Marrakesh Treaty48 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a
mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce,
distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without
the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to
sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level
(e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

           this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in

The implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty will improve access and needs to be
implemented in order to measure the positive results it will hopefully bring to the disabled
population.



E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics49 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of
vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through
the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and
data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories
or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it
is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies
unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception
for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and


49
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.



                                                                                              36
data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is
clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but
can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether
the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the
necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to
obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions
to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”50. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
       experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining
       methods, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including
across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
 NO
Today there is no evidence of market failure, but quite the opposite considering the
statement provided by publishers during the Licences For Europe dialogue, in which
publishers commit to offer TDM licences for non-commercial purposes on request and by
default within their standard agreements with the libraries. An exception however could
potentially pose problems, notably affecting the quality of carefully managed and complex
databases by giving access and permission to the copying (reproduction) of whole
collections which potentially can create a risk of abuse. The fact that the scale of copying
would not be limited and the difficulties of pursuing for infringement if i.e. files shipped to
Russia or China it becomes very difficult to control and limit the exception.

54.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
For the reasons explained in the previous answer, and the fact that there is good faith on
behalf of scientific publishers to provide a solution which would ensure the highest quality
to the researcher undertaking data mining to do so in a managed environment, the solution
put forward in Licenses for Europe is clearly the way forward and in this respect the
Commission’s willingness and initiative taken during this dialogue to facilitate such results
has been very useful.


55.        If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
           elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
A legislative solution may undermine the provision of royalty-free licenses to carry out non-
commercial data mining. As demonstrated in the previous question, new business models
and solution are evolving, which could be undermined by a legislative solution in form of an
exception.

56.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See answer to question 54: For the reasons explained in the previous answer, and the fact
that there is good faith on behalf of scientific publishers to provide a solution which would
ensure the highest quality to the researcher undertaking data mining to do so in a
managed environment, the solution put forward in Licenses for Europe is clearly the way
forward and in this respect the Commission’s willingness and initiative taken during this
dialogue to facilitate such results has been very useful.

57.        Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
           text or data mining methods?

F.         User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms
and blogs51. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing
works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative
effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content
with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic

51
     A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.



                                                                                            38
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works
with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence
schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences
concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event,
practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small
users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the “Licences for
Europe” discussions52.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
        when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new
        content on the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate
new content on the Internet, including across borders?
 NO
In the specific case of press publishing, press publishers recognise and welcome that press
publishing is a two-way dialogue in today’s digital environment. UGC in the press-publishing
sector concerns on the one hand what users do with publishers’ content and on the other
how publishers then choose to interact with that content and additional content provided
directly by users. In summary: a) publishers choose to share professional content with their
readers, in order that they may share it with others, for example by allowing links to articles
to be shared via social media, b) readers choose to share content with publishers, in order
that they can contribute to democratic debate, for example, by providing text, photographs
and video via publishers’ websites or applications on various devices in relation to news
events.
To the EPC’s knowledge, no specific problems have been raised by users in the context of
being refused permission to use press publishers’ content for non-commercial UGC.

In fact, press publishers contacted by users who wish to use their content typically provide
licences for use of the content usually for free, as long as it is not for commercial
exploitation. In the digital environment, press publishers have however started using more
straight forward digital solutions to share their content legally and as widely as possible.
Furthermore, technology is being further developed to facilitate click-through licensing
solutions for users. In particular, via the Linked Content Coalition, a cross-media,
multinational coalition of more than 40 partners – including press publishers - from the
media and creative industries, including representatives of authors and artists, which was
launched in 2011 to work together with their standards bodies to establish automated and
semi-automated communications, based on identifiers and interoperable metadata
standards, between rightsholders and those who wish to use content.53 A pilot project, the
RDI, co-funded by the European Commission is now underway to further develop the
project.
Similarly any Web user creating new content, whether it involves re-use of existing content
or not, should be able simply to add such identifiers to enable them to better protect and
potentially monetise their content.


59.        (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
           experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on
           the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are
           proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
 YES
The EPC has worked on these issues for several years, originally from a B2B supply-side
perspective, aiming to find a solution for publishers to work efficiently with search engines
and other aggregating platforms, ensuring that publishers’ rights could be communicated in
machine readable formats to be recognised and interpreted at scale and where
appropriate, their usage remunerated. As Google in particular, only offered a total opt-out
from scraping and indexing via the Robots Exclusion Protocol, publishers wanted to work
with search engines to find internet friendly ways to create a partial opt out; they wanted
mainly, and still do wish to be able to specify how much of their content could be indexed
and displayed in order to retain some control over its usage by third parties while
developing their own business models. This early project, ACAP (automated content access
protocol) was terminated as soon as Google made it clear that, even though they had
participated in its development, they would not implement it. The ACAP work has now
been taken over by a global standards body (IPTC) and merged into industry-wide work on

NewsML. Furthermore, as referenced above, the EPC launched a new project called the
Linked Content Coalition in 2011, a cross-media group of experts whose goal is to develop
solutions on how to assert ownership of online content and of how to communicate
copyright terms and conditions in the digital environment and to enable greater legitimate
use of digital content through better management of data relating to rights across the
network. The LCC recognizes that securing the highest possible level of automation in
licensing will reduce barriers to entry, reduce cost in the supply chain, increase volume of
use and encourage innovation. The Linked Content Coalition's technical framework adopted
in April 201354 is now being tested via the eu-co funded RDI project55, co-funded by the
European Commission.
The aim is ultimately, for all media types and sectors, to facilitate click-through licensing
solutions for users, both for B2C and B2B usages. Identifiers are critical in this context, and
with interoperable metadata standards we can establish automated and semi-automated
communications between right holders and those who wish to use the content.


60.        (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
           experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you
           have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
YES
Many publishes allow users to contribute with their own content and this has often
enriched professionally published content - mutualised journalism as it is sometimes called.
Press publishers indicate in their terms and conditions how they will deal with material that
a creator chooses to share or contribute to the publishers’ platform.
The EPC also believes that content created by users will increasingly make use of identifiers
so as to be able to monetize their content throughout its life cycle.


61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


62.        If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
           elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

The EPC recommends the European Commission could encourage projects working on
identifiers, interoperable metadata standards, but also automated payment systems,
incubators for start-ups all to support the creative sectors find new ways to manage their
creative work. Increasingly the users, whether it is the end consumer or a commercial
operator, will enjoy easy click through solutions or licenses that are automated and that
can be read by a search engine, for example. The most appropriate way would be to create
priorities within EC funding programmes to ensure access to funding for such projects.


      III. Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for
such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile
listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by
certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for
rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether
the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in
her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may
indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service
provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead
to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service
providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
        the private copying and reprography exceptions59 in the digital environment?

Direct out-licensing of digital publications/services to the end-users (European consumers)
will be the future model. This includes direct payments to the publishers/broadcasters from
the end-users. The terms of use define the use of publications/services.
We may come to a future where levies are not needed but they are needed today. Private
copying continues to take place, compensation will continue to play a valuable role in the
years to come to guarantee that right holders are appropriately compensated for legal acts
of private copying, especially in an environment where a lot of non-authorised copying
takes place.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
        a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
        rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?60
 NO
Private copying will be less of an issue in the future. When there is no harm to the right
holder or the harm is minimal, the digital copies should not be subject to private copying
levies. This is increasingly the case.

66.     How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
        (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
        copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
        business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
It is key for publishers to be in charge of licensing through direct licensing. To have e.g.
cloud based ISPs’ content services be subject to private copying levies could potentially lead
to a loss of revenues and loss of direct customer relations. As already stated increasingly
levies will be of less importance in the digital age as licensing will be dealt with directly.


67.      Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
        subject to levies?61
 YES
Transparency is important and can also support awareness-raising. Levies on products
should be made visible.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same
time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private
copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to
a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have

                                                                                         43
ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments62.

68.     Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
        undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles
        to the free movement of goods or services?
NO
This question seems to concern primarily manufacturers and importers, EPC has thus
limited information and experience in this matter. However should the issue of double
payment arise (i.e payment of the levy both by the manufacturer of the device and then
again by the importer), it seems useful to implement an efficient system allowing for
refunds.


69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
        persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
        transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
        provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

70.     Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To
        what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
        existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?

71.     If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
        system, how would these problems best be solved?

      IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights
from authors or performers to producers63 or determining who the owner of the rights is
when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract64. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and
there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately
remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider
that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the
62

   See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

                                                                                         44
whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices,
negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of
possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at
national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
        combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
        for the exploitation of your works and performances?

73.     Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
        contracts)?
NO
The EPC believes that this issue should be discussed at the level closest to the parties at
national level to find the most adequate solution. As rightly stated in the introductory text
of this part regulatory approaches in Member States differ as well as approaches in the
various content sectors.

74.     If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
        address the shortcomings you identify?
The EPC believes that this issue should be discussed at the level closest to the parties at
national level to find the most adequate solution. As rightly stated in the introductory text
of this part regulatory approaches in Member States differ as well as approaches in the
various content sectors.

      V.Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought
by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are
concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection
of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it
cannot be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of
infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright
when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose67. One means to do this could
65
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
66
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
67
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.



                                                                                          45
be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure68. At the same time, there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
        infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
YES
To ensure that Europe has vibrant and attractive legal online content offers that reflect the
European richness in the high quality professional content production, the civil
enforcement system needs to be rendered more efficient when it comes to tackling online
piracy.
Despite the positive benefits of the implementation of the 2004/48/EC directive, the
challenge of fighting piracy online has grown even bigger. Online piracy affecting the
content sector can take different forms depending on the various content sectors. Typically
in the field of publishing, B2B piracy is often the major issue, where search engines index,
copy, aggregate content and provide links without prior permission.
As mentioned in our response to question 11, a common pattern in copyright infringement
cases is the separation of the actual copyrighted material reproduced and stored without
permission in a cyber-locker and the posting of the hyperlink to such pirated copy (as the
only way to access and download the content). Publishers spend high amounts of money to
crawl the web for pirated copies, to send take down notices to cyber-lockers, with varying
degrees of cooperation, but have limited options to require removal of the posted links.
The making available of a hyperlink to an infringing copy is the one act enabling piracy on a
large scale – and copyright law should thus be amended to treat as infringements those
acts of making available hyperlinks to copies which are clearly and obviously unlawfully-
produced or obviously unlawfully made available to the public. In this context, it is worth
noting that Article 53 German Copyright Act already uses successfully uses such
terminology.
The EPC believes that all players in the value chain need to cooperate, to ensure that with
benefit comes responsibility is important to undertake a) a thorough analysis of the role
and effect of content aggregators and b) to ensure that reproduction or displays of
copyright material for commercial purposes (i.e. by linking and/or using search engine
technology and copying a headline and headnote /photograph) are treated within copyright
law as a distribution or making available of the work to the public. It is essential to find
efficient ways of tackling copyright infringement on the internet as the spread of the
infringing work is so fast which creates damage and loss of revenue at a click. Reflections on
fast track procedures should be encouraged, accompanied by efficient notice and take
down procedures.



68
  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.



                                                                                        46
To per se exclude a clarification of the current liability provisions of the e-commerce
directive is not necessarily helpful. If Europe wants a competitive content market it needs
to put the necessary means into place.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
       involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
       brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
       online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
       would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
The current legal framework, also comprising the 2001/31/EC Directive, contains provisions
which have led to ISPs exercising a middleman role leading to inefficiency when dealing
with illegal content. The limited liability provisions where granted in order to make such
businesses thrive as they were in the beginning of their development. However over the
years it has been shown that these businesses have indeed thrived and in some cases vis
small and incremental infringements of 3rd party content. Further clarification on liability
provisions and notice and takedown procedures would be welcome.
Additionally EPC is currently involved in the work related to development of identifiers and
interoperable rights expression langue and metadata standards. The involvement of
platforms and ISPs in such projects involving machine-readable licences in particular would
be helpful and would favour the creation of a sustainable content market. See
linkedcontentcoalition.org and rdi-project.org.

77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
       achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights
       such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
NO
Further clarification is welcome as there are perverse outcomes arising from Data
Protection legislation where it interacts with notice and take down practices whereby the
mantel of privacy is facilitating piracy. The Telefonica judgement said provisions in
community law that protect intellectual property must be balanced with those that protect
personal privacy. Privacy concerns must be recognised but when it is necessary to prove an
infringement of the law right holders should be able to access information allowing them
put the infringement to an end and claim damages occurred by the loss.

       VI.    A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright
debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such
an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that




                                                                           47
the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation
while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

78.        Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
           of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright
           across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
NO
The EU can pursue further harmonisation without the establishment of an EU copyright
title. It also remains doubtful which legal basis would serve for such a purpose and whether
such a purpose would be necessary and proportionate to achieve its aim. If the overall aim
is to create a vibrant European creative and content market reflecting the rich cultural
diversity existing in Europe, the aim of the European Commission should be to reflect on an
overall long term industrial policy setting the right framework for the creative sectors.
The introduction of a single EU Copyright Title would not necessarily mean that a licence
would, of necessity, cover the entirety of the single market. In that context, it is interesting
to draw a comparison with the Regulation for Unitary Patent Protection for the whole of
the EU adopted in September 201269. Article 3.2 of that Regulation makes it clear that a
European patent will provide: “…uniform protection and shall have equal effect in all the
participating Member States.” However, it goes on to say that “It may be licensed in
respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating Member States. “If a
similar approach was taken to a unitary copyright, the position would be the same.
Whilst pan-territorial licences may often be in the consumer interest, this is not always the
case. Pan-European licences for content can be expensive to acquire. This can discriminate
against smaller players who want to provide a service to provide digital content to a local
market. If only pan-European licences were available, they may be priced out of the market.
In that way, pan-European licences could lead to a concentrated market which would not
be in the consumer’s interests.
From a pragmatic perspective we think that there are other more pressing issues, especially
in the area of rights automation, that call for solutions. EPC maintains an open mind on this
issue but considers that it does not currently high on the copyright ‘to do’ list and the
subject would need further analysis of the costs and benefits associated with moving
towards a wholly new copyright framework in the EU.


79.        Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
           current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
           longer term project?

                                                                              48
      VII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most
important matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any
important matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our
attention, so they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.     Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
        copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.


We wish to seek clarification that legal recognition and protection of identifiers associated
with a copy of a copyright work, or which appears in connection with the
communication to the public of a copyright work, is covered by Article 7 of Directive
2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society as well as
extending similar protection to databases which are protected by the EC’s sui generis
database right.
Finally, the EPC is currently in the process of elaborating its Vision Paper on Copyright,
Technology and Practical Solutions in the digital age. This is an exercise that is organised
independently from EPC’s contribution to this consultation. However EPC would welcome
the opportunity to present these proposals to the Commission later in 2014.
