   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

It is core to the business  of  record  companies  to  make  as  much  music
available to EU consumers as possible through  the  most  consumer  friendly
models. With a huge variety of different services providing over 37  million
recordings across the EU we  believe  it  is  arguably  the  best  and  most
advanced digital content  business  in  Europe.  As  part  of  this,  record
companies grant EU-wide cross-border  licenses  and  indeed  in  some  cases
worldwide licenses. Record companies encourage services to  launch  as  soon
as possible and in as many countries as possible – our business model is  to
make our content available to as many customers as possible.  Digital  music
services are available everywhere in Europe.


Over the last years, the music industry has revolutionized itself under  the
current framework, and Europe is becoming a  key  creative  centre  for  the
music business  globally.  The  European  digital  music  market  has  grown
considerably in the past few years  (from  €200  million  in  2004  to  €1.2
billion in 2012), and increased significantly in its variety.


Digital music services in Europe have achieved incredible scale in  a  short
period, offering over 37 million  tracks  to  all  European  consumers,  and
repertoire continues to grow. Now  there  are  267  digital  music  services
available  in  Europe,  ranging   from   pay-per-transaction   services   to
subscription services, including freemium ad-supported services. Five  major
music services – iTunes, Deezer, 7Digital, Youtube, MySpace  –  are  already
available  everywhere  in  Europe.  Spotify  is  available  in  25  European
countries, and other services are available everywhere or almost  everywhere
in Europe too: XBoxMusic is rolling out in all  28  countries,  Rara  in  20
countries, eMusic in 25 countries, GooglePlay  in  15  countries.  In  fact,
many of the leading online and digital services, such  as  Spotify,  Deezer,
Last.FM,  7digital,  are  European  success  stories.  These  services  have
developed on the basis of the existing copyright framework  and  the  multi-
territory licences given by the right holders.


Music  services  are  portable  across  borders,  allowing  subscribers   to
streaming services to travel with full  access  to  their  service,  and  to
consult services and playlists in other countries.


However, despite the progress of new digital service  business  models,  the
biggest obstacle to the development of services  online  is  online  piracy.
Piracy makes it extremely difficult for digital music  services  and  start-
ups to break into countries where piracy is prevalent, and to develop  their
business  in  those  countries.  Directive  2004/48/EC  must  therefore   be
improved on a number of points.


A 2013 survey conducted by GfK and the Coalition  of  Creators  and  Content
Industries (Coalición de Creadores e Industrias  de  Contenido)  shows  that
the volume of pirate music products in Spain  in  2012  was  valued  at  6.9
billion euros. In Spain,  33%  of  Internet  users  download  music  content
illegally, and one in two Internet users have accessed unauthorized  content
online at some time.


Revenues for sound recordings have dropped  for  eleven  years  straight  in
Spain to less than a quarter of what they were in  2001.  Annual  income  in
the Spanish digital market is now surpassed by much smaller  countries  such
as Norway, and total recording industry revenue in Spain has been  overtaken
recently by Sweden.


As for hard goods  piracy,  street  piracy  remains  a  highly  visible  and
unabated problem in Spain particularly for the music  and  film  industries.
For the music industry, illegal CD sales amount to 19% of the legal  market.

€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


Record companies are regularly asked for and regularly grant EU-wide  cross-
border licences, and in some case even world-wide licences, either  directly
or  via  collective  management  organizations  representing  their  rights.
However, many services elect to roll out  on  a  gradual  country-by-country
basis, in order to adapt  to  local  conditions  and  consumers’  needs  and
preferences. They often, therefore, do not want a  multi-territory  licence,
although they are also glad to know that when they expand, licensing  is  in
place to facilitate their work.


Copyright is not an issue. The practice shows that  many  digital  platforms
elect to roll out services on  a  gradual  country  by  country  basis,  for
commercial reasons, and to adapt their  services  to  consumers’  needs  and
tastes in each country. Many non-copyright factors are also involved in  the
development  of  services   across   borders,   and   require   considerable
investment, such as negotiating deals with local operators, including  ISPs,
mobile networks, advertisers, payment providers etc.


Even large companies with significant resources such  as  Apple  and  Google
have staggered their roll outs. Like any business, digital services need  to
manage their growth, and there are a number of business  reasons  for  this,
which include trying out  new  business  models  (which  requires  time  and
considerable  resources),  setting   up   local   offices,   marketing   and
communication, and a need for a local presence to provide  locally  targeted
editorial content in the national language. Furthermore, they  need  to  set
up distribution, reporting and payment systems. A key factor  mentioned  for
the success of online services is the proximity to local consumers.  Indeed,
some services only look to service  specific  national  audiences  (such  as
BelgianMusic, WIMP, Cubomusica). A rushed  launch  with  insufficient  local
presence and marketing,  without  testing  market  reactions,  can  severely
damage a service or even destroy its chances.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


If  a  service  chooses  to  roll-out  on  a  country-by-country  basis,  as
explained in our response to Q3, this is not due  to  copyright,  but  to  a
strategy that reflects the diversity of European culture  and  markets.  The
crucial problem – online piracy –  should  be  addressed  by  applying  more
efficient enforcement measures and remedies (see our responses to  Questions
75 and 76).


In addition, the record industry continues to  provide  various  information
tools which help to  raise  awareness  regarding  legal  services  available
across Europe.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


Record companies’ objective is to make repertoire available in  all  markets
where they have rights to do so. There is no reason for record companies  to
withhold rights to certain content. The only reason why rights might not  be
granted is if the companies do not hold rights  in  certain  countries.  The
fact that rights  are  territorially  defined  should  not  be  regarded  as
territorial restrictions. As explained above, our companies  license  rights
on a multi-territory, sometimes worldwide, basis.


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


Not applicable, see our response to Question 5.


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


The widespread availability of licensed  music  content  across  the  EU  is
already a reality, no legislative changes are necessary. The music  industry
is one of the most advanced digital content businesses in Europe.


The European copyright system is based on rights granted  to  right  holders
in each Member State, but this does not preclude the licensing of rights  on
a pan-European basis and the growth of  legal  services  across  Europe,  as
explained in our response to Question 3. Successful digital  music  services
have been built on the current EU copyright framework, which shows that  the
system is able to foster and support the growth of the  digital  economy  in
the EU. Changing this framework without clear evidence of  the  need  to  do
so, and without proof of any actual benefit  to  the  market,  would  create
major uncertainty and would prejudice the continued growth and viability  of
digital services.


€ NO OPINION


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES


See our response to Question 9.

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


We are not aware of any reasons why changes would be necessary, and  neither
are there any reasons to believe that any  changes  would  have  a  positive
effect on the market. On the contrary, changes to the territorial  scope  of
the “making available” right such as a  “country  of  origin”  approach,  or
“targeting” approach, would negatively affect music  rights,  both  from  an
enforcement and a licensing perspective.


As explained in our response to Question 8, there is no need to clarify  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right,  which  is  derived  from
international treaties as  well  as  European  law.  The  rights  of  record
producers, including the right of making available, are frequently  licensed
on  a  multi-territory  basis,  and  we  have  not   encountered   practical
difficulties due to possible  differences  existing  in  national  rules  on
authorship/ownership or transfer of rights.


As regards enforcement of rights, as a matter of  practice,  litigation  can
take place where the infringing act occurs, i.e. in the  country  where  the
server is located (where the act of uploading takes  place),  and  in  every
country where the server / service is accessed by members of the public.  In
many cases, national courts confirmed  that  the  act  of  making  available
covered both “upstream” and “downstream” activities, confirming that  making
available occurs in the country where the server is located,  and  in  every
country where the server/service is accessed. The introduction of  either  a
so-called  “country-of-origin”  principle   or   an   “exploitation/targeted
public” principle through EU-wide legislation would  be  contrary  to  these
principles and would interfere with the enforcement  of  producers’  rights,
limiting the ability  to  bring  infringement  proceedings  against  illegal
services. This negative effect would be all  the  more  prejudicial  in  the
absence of availability of cross-border injunctions.


The introduction of a so-called  “country-of-origin”  principle  for  online
licensing would lead to forum-shopping for the  acquisition  of  rights,  as
also  concluded  in  the  Commission’s  Study  on  the  Application  of  the
Information Society Directive (p. 182 of the Study), and would  not  produce
any improvement over the  current  situation,  where  digital  services  and
content are already  available  across  Europe.  The  “exploitation/targeted
public” principle could be difficult to define due to the lack of  objective
criteria to define the concept of “exploitation” and  “the  target  of  that
exploitation”, which, in  practice,  would  be  defined  on  a  case-by-case
basis, and this could lead to a lot of uncertainty for  both  right  holders
and consumers.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


The provision of a hyperlink should, at least in certain  circumstances,  be
subject to the authorisation of the right holders.  This  was  confirmed  by
the CJEU in  the  Svensson  case  (C-466/12).  The  Svensson  decision  also
confirms that authorisation for linking does not extend to links  to  copies
that have been made available without the permission of the  right  holders.
For instance, linking to a copy that was made available  by  a  third  party
without the consent of the right holder would clearly violate the  right  of
communication to the public.


There have also been several  cases  at  national  level  on  the  issue  of
linking and on the scope of the communication to the public right  that  are
consistent with this  reasoning,  and  which  cases  should  be  taken  into
account. For  instance,  in  2011  the  Vizcaya  Criminal  Court  of  Appeal
reversed a previous ruling and held for the first time  in  Spain  that  the
activity  carried  out  by  the  administrators  of  two  e-links   websites
(FenixP2P and mp3-es.com ) should  be  deemed  as  an  infringement  of  the
communication  to  the  public/making  available  to   the   public   right.
Additionally, in a  more  recent  ruling  –  January  2014  –  the  Valencia
Criminal Court of Appeal upheld a previous decision  which  found  that  the
website  operator of  Divxonline  did  engage  in  a  communication  to  the
public activity when providing links to infringing  content  hosted  in  P2P
networks and making available to the public movies/TV  Series  in  streaming
too.


An additional example is piracy via  BitTorrent  where  illegal  content  is
accessed via links that direct users to the location where they  can  access
content. Many significant pirate services use the aggregation  of  links  to
infringing content in order  to  operate  and  generate  revenue.  In  these
circumstances the very act of linking  –  e.g.,  linking  by  someone  whose
object is to assist in  the  infringement  of  copyright  by  systematically
directing  users  to  infringing  copies  –  should  itself  constitute   an
infringement of copyright.


The CJEU judgement in the Svensson case and other cases  at  national  level
indicate that a broad definition of the communication to  the  public  right
should be maintained. Otherwise right holders may be  deprived  of  remedies
against these forms of piracy.


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


Comment:  the  EU  Copyright  Directive  Article  5.1   provides   that   no
authorisation is required for temporary reproduction  (a)  for  transmission
by an intermediary and (b) for lawful use. Under  this  clear  statement  of
law, protection has been given  to  the  right  holders  without  inhibiting
legitimate internet services.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


In the recorded music sector, the consequences of  enabling  the  resale  of
digital content would have very harmful consequences for  the  entire  music
market.  Digital  files  that  are  transmitted  electronically   are   very
different from, and have different market impacts than, recordings  sold  in
physical formats.


The notion that the exhaustion principle should apply to copies acquired  by
means of digital transmissions in the same way that it applies  to  physical
copies ignores the many differences between the  two  kinds  of  copies  and
between the two distribution processes.


Looking specifically at the  music  sector,  the  resale  of  used  physical
recordings  is  in  the  following  context:  (1)  the  quality   of   these
deteriorates with time, and often due to wear and tear or  mishandling,  (2)
purchasing an item at a used record store requires travelling to  the  store
and searching for a copy of the phonograph record, and (3) the  resale  only
concerns the original recording, not copies of that recording[29],


These issues do not apply  to  files  that  are  available  and  transmitted
online.


First, the quality of a digital file is by nature identical to that  of  the
“original” file, with  the  result  that  the  file  transmitted  completely
substitutes the original.  Second,  because  the  resale  of  mp3  files  or
similar files actually involves the making and transmission of a  new  copy,
one cannot ensure that the person  who  sells  the  used  file  is  actually
surrendering his or her own possession of a copy. This means that  a  seller
may well retain and continue to use  a  copy  (quite  unlike  the  situation
involving sales of used hard copies) or resell multiple  (unlimited)  copies
from a single copy. This risk is increased by the fact that, in response  to
demands from consumers, a la carte music downloading  services  do  not  use
any technological protection measures.


The adoption of “digital exhaustion” would severely affect online  services,
and would strongly prejudice right holders who would not  share  in  any  of
revenues from sales of copies that have displaced  sales  of  material,  and
creators would find it more difficult to make a  living  and  draw  revenues
from the sale of original content.


It is worth noting that the consequences of enabling the resale  of  content
by means of digital transmissions have been analysed by  the  United  States
Copyright Office in its Section 104 Report (2001) and, more recently,  by  a
U.S. federal court in Capitol Records v. ReDigi (2012), and the  conclusions
of both the report and the  decision  stress  the  negative  impact  on  the
market for creative works.


As the U.S. Copyright Office concluded in its  Report  (in  language  relied
upon by the court in Redigi, this quotation is from the Section  104  Report
at pp. 82-83): “Physical copies of works degrade with time and  use,  making
used copies less desirable than  new  ones.  Digital  information  does  not
degrade, and can be reproduced perfectly  on  a  recipient’s  computer.  The
‘used’ copy is just as desirable as (in fact, is indistinguishable  from)  a
new copy of the same work. Time, space, effort and cost  no  longer  act  as
barriers to the movement of copies, since digital copies can be  transmitted
nearly instantaneously  anywhere  in  the  world  with  minimal  effort  and
negligible cost. The need to transport physical copies of works, which  acts
as a natural brake on the effect of resale on the copyright owner’s  market,
no longer exists in the realm of digital transmissions. The ability of  such
‘used’ copies to compete for market  share  with  new  copies  is  thus  far
greater in the digital world.”


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[30]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[31].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


€ NO


Identifiers and information  about  ownership  and  rights  are  subject  to
market-led solutions, on a global level and on a case by case  basis,  where
a business need arises, therefore the creation of an EU registration  system
is unnecessary. A system imposed by legislation  carries  significant  risks
for  the  market  including   additional   administrative   burdens,   added
infrastructure and IT costs and  potential  conflict  with  existing  market
solutions.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[32], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[33]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[34]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[35] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


The need for  identifiers  is  driven  by  the  market  which  has  provided
solutions, and will continue to do so in order to meet industry demands.  In
our view, the European  Commission  can  do  two  things  in  the  immediate
future:


(1) In cases where the foundational work needs to  be  put  into  place  the
Commission  can  lead  the  way,  often  working  with  industry  and  other
stakeholders, such as with the  Linked  Content  Coalition  (LCC  Framework,
http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org).


(2)  Allow  market  activity   to   shape   developments   around   database
interoperability.  In some cases, industry alone can drive developments,  as
with company databases and data quality improvements. In  some  instances  a
partnership  between  industry  and   standards-setting   bodies   is   more
appropriate: for example in the current plans to work with ISO  on  revising
the ISRC standard.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[36]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


As the representative of the  recording  industry  in  Spain,  our  response
focuses on the term of protection for sound recordings.


The EU Term Extension Directive was  only  recently  adopted  after  lengthy
consideration, and  it  came  into  force  on  the  1st  November  2013.  We
therefore question whether any re-assessment is appropriate at this stage.


The current EU  term  of  70  years  from  publication  for  performers  and
producers in a sound recording was only recently increased to  be  more  in-
line with the international trend. Many countries have 70 years and  higher,
with the US having a 95 year term.


The 70-year term reflects  the  fact  that  performers  are  living  longer.
Furthermore, the infinite nature of the internet means that a vast array  of
repertoire can be made available in a way that was  not  possible  in  brick
and mortar stores. This created the opportunity for many performers to  have
a second career as their older recordings are rediscovered by  consumers.  A
70-year term for sound recordings ensures that  artists  are  protected  and
can earn remuneration later in life, which is why artists  were  such  vocal
supporters of the extension  to  70  years.  Moreover,  additional  measures
provided under the EU law and national legislation ensure that  artists  get
additional benefits and remuneration from an extended term of protection.


A longer term of protection  also  benefits  new  artists,  as  income  from
copyright is available to  be  re-invested  in  discovering,  nurturing  and
promoting  new  musical  talent  in  Europe,  ensuring  continued   cultural
diversity as well as more opportunities for young performers.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[37].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[38].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[39], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[40],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[41].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


€ NO – Please explain


The exceptions in the EU Copyright legislation are  drafted  in  a  flexible
way and accommodate a large variety of digital uses. There is  a  degree  of
variation in exceptions among  the  Member  States  due  to  their  optional
character, however, in most cases these  variations  are  of  little  or  no
practical consequence. This is due to the  fact  that  the  main  exceptions
(for  the  disabled,  libraries,  education,  press,  quotation)  have  been
implemented in all Member States. Also, many exceptions  (e.g.  museums  and
prisons, repair of equipment,  architectural  works,  etc)  have  no  cross-
border impact.


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


€ NO – Please explain


As the Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information Society  Directive  notes,
exceptions are derogations from the rights of creators, and they need to  be
applied and interpreted strictly. The potential need for making some or  all
exceptions mandatory across Europe should therefore  be  clearly  justified,
and in particular the economic impact of such measure should be  quantified.
The same applies to any further harmonisation. As mentioned  under  Question
21, most exceptions are already implemented in all Member States,  and  many
of them do not even have any cross-border effects.


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


Existing exceptions already provide a large degree of  flexibility  and  are
able to  accommodate  new  uses  online.  For  the  rest,  we  believe  that
licensing solutions are the most flexible and  fastest  way  to  accommodate
new digital uses, knowing that many of these uses have a commercial  impact.



If any problems arise, the music industry has proven itself open to  looking
at ways to ensure that the market can deliver pragmatic  solutions  for  the
benefit of all parties. Before any  new  exceptions  are  considered,  their
necessity (including why they would be preferable  to  licensing  solutions)
should be  proven  on  the  basis  of  clear  evidence  and  sound  economic
analysis. This analysis should, in particular, look at  the  extent  of  the
perceived need in terms of quantity of  potential  users  across  Europe  in
relation to the impact on the market, and for example whether there  is  any
market failure which cannot be fixed  without  changes  to  legislation.  To
date no such problem or market failure has been identified.


One  important  example,  user-generated  content  (UGC),  has   significant
commercial impact and value, and record companies have  been  licensing  UGC
for some time. As explained in our responses to  Questions  58-63  on  User-
Generated  Content,  record  companies  license  platforms   directly.   The
licences given by the companies to UGC platforms  also  enable  the  posting
[embedding] of UGC  by  users  on  their  own  blogs  or  websites,  thereby
extending  the  authorised  uses  beyond  the  platforms   themselves.   The
introduction of  a  new  exception  is  not  necessary,  and  would  deprive
creators of revenues, without bringing any benefit to the end-user. .


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


€ NO – Please explain why


The existing exceptions already provide for a large degree  of  flexibility.
Member States have room to implement exceptions in a focused  manner,  where
necessary. The CJEU provides interpretation of the  EU-wide  concepts.  More
flexibility in the form of an open-ended  exception  would  neither  provide
legal certainty nor more harmonisation  at  EU  level.  We  agree  with  the
authors  of  the  Study  On  The  Application  of  Directive  2001/29/EC  on
Copyright  and  Related  Rights  in  the  Information   Society   that   the
introduction of an open “horizontal”  exception  or  a  “fair-use”  kind  of
exception in the Directive 2001/29/EC, which would introduce flexibility  to
the list of exceptions, would not be a good option  because  it  will  raise
more questions and go beyond what is necessary for “certain special  cases”,
which is required under  the  three-step  test,  provided  by  international
legislation (WCT, WPPT, TRIPs) and EU legislation (Article 5.5 of  Directive
2001/29), and would have an adverse impact on the  Internal  Market  because
it is an unfamiliar concept for copyright in most  Member  States  (see  pp.
534 – 539). We think that the three-step test  should  remain  the  ultimate
safety net for right holders and it is the precondition for the  flexibility
of the scope of certain exceptions listed in Directive 2001/29/EC.


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


We have not faced any practical problems or market failures because  of  the
territoriality of limitations and exceptions.

€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

Assuming that a particular act has an effect in more than  one  country  and
is subject to an exception that requires compensation, compensation  arising
from the harm suffered in each country should  be  paid  to  the  person  or
entity that holds the rights in that particular country, and should be  paid
by the person benefiting from the exception in that country.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[42] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[43].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[44].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

In our view, there is no need for any extension of the existing  exceptions.
If problems exist, market-based solutions, such as  new  licensing  schemes,
should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are  flexible  and
can be implemented  and  adapted  faster  than  legislation,  and  can  then
continue to adapt to changing consumer habits and technology.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

There is no need for new exceptions or limitations, or for any extension  of
the existing exceptions. If problems exist, market-based solutions, such  as
new licensing schemes  should  be  preferred  whenever  possible,  as  these
solutions are flexible and  can  be  implemented  and  adapted  faster  than
legislation. To date no such problem or market failure has been identified.


Moreover, there is no need for such exceptions and limitations with  respect
to  music  because  access  to  music  is  already  ubiquitous  and  readily
available at attractive conditions due to developments in  the  marketplace.
The free-to-use on-demand services (freemium) that are  available,  such  as
the ad-supported versions of Spotify or Deezer, give instant access  to  all
EU consumers to a catalogue of 37  million  tracks  from  all  over  Europe,
enabling also research and private study.  Any  extension  of  the  existing
exception in the  field  of  music  regarding  the  online  consultation  is
therefore unnecessary.




  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


€ NO


The wide availability of digital music  services,  including  in  particular
those operating a “freemium” model means that any  exception  for  e-lending
is unnecessary.


Moreover, e-lending by public institutions could interfere  with  legitimate
music services that are offered on  the  marketplace,  providing  the  world
repertoire in  various  formats  and  at  attractive  conditions  (including
freemium models) and  having  made  significant  investment.  Unlicensed  e-
lending would provide users  with  totally  substitutable  services  to  the
services  offered  by  commercial  providers,  which  would  prejudice   the
exploitation of producers’ rights  and  would  harm  the  digital  services.
Furthermore, unlike physical copies of works, digital copies do not  degrade
with time and usage and  can  be  reproduced  perfectly.  In  addition,  the
making available by public institutions of a single copy  of  a  work  to  a
potentially unlimited number of users via e-lending would lead  to  multiple
simultaneous  uses  of  a  single  copy,  which  would  have  a  much   more
detrimental effect on the exploitation of  the  work  than  the  lending  of
physical copies which are based on one user per copy. As such the impact  of
a potential exception would have a far  greater  economic  impact  than  the
traditional physical schemes. These activities  should  therefore  be  dealt
with by the market place and should be subject to licenses.





€ NO OPINION


  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

As explained above, an exception for e-lending in the field of  music  would
directly harm the legal market.  Any  problems  arising  can,  and  must  be
solved by licensing schemes.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

[Open question]

It should be noted that when libraries  get  into  the  business  of  making
works  available  online,  they  are  starting  to  compete  in  the   areas
traditionally governed by the marketplace, and therefore there is much  less
justification for exceptions and limitations.


Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[45].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[46].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


€ NO – Please explain


This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties. There  is
no issue of out-of-commerce recordings for  the  music  industry.  Moreover,
the wide availability of music content makes mass digitisation unnecessary.


€ NO OPINION





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?


€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


Producers are able to license their content directly; no additional  schemes
or mechanisms are needed.


€ NO OPINION


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

There is no need to extend any existing exceptions.


We agree with the conclusions of the authors of the  Commission’s  Study  on
the 2001 Information Society Directive that the exception for  teaching  and
research (art. 5.3(a)) is formulated openly, i.e. e-learning is included  in
the scope of the exception. The Study points out  that  the  issue  is  that
some  implemented  national  laws  show  a  restrictive  transposition   and
diverging conditions. We agree with the opinion expressed in the Study  that
the best option to address and solve the divergences  would  be  to  require
Member States to  meet  the  aims  of  the  exception,  especially  when  it
concerns cross-border teaching and research (pp. 402 – 403 of the Study).

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[49]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [50].

The Marrakesh Treaty[51] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[52] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[53].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[54]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are

€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


€ NO


Today, consumers enjoy creating content with a combination of  images,  text
and music  content,  often  using  somebody  else’s  pre-existing  copyright
protected content. This is usually described as  “User  Generated  Content”.
In practice, the greatest majority of UGC uses significant portions of  pre-
existing works  which  are  protected  by  copyright.  For  instance,  users
combine a wedding video with a  music  track,  or  apply  new  lyrics  to  a
popular music video.  


User Generated Content (UGC) accounts for a significant  proportion  of  the
content  available  on  video  streaming  platforms.  The  record   industry
licences UGC platforms that  make  available  new  content  based  on  sound
recordings and music videos created by the  record  labels.  These  licences
are provided on a cross-border basis.


The licences given by the companies also enable the posting  [embedding]  of
UGC by  users  on  their  own  blogs  or  websites,  thereby  extending  the
authorised uses beyond the platforms  themselves.  This  enables  users  who
wish to show their UGC on their own blogs and websites to do so  by  posting
the UGC on a licensed platform and then “embedding” the  video,  such  as  a
wedding video, on their blog or website, which  makes  it  appear  that  the
video is coming from their site although in fact it is coming from  the  UGC
platform. This is beneficial to the user, who can take  advantage  of  user-
friendly tools generally provided by the platforms that are probably  easier
for most people to use than the tools they  would  use  to  put  the  videos
directly on their websites, and because the act of  ‘making  available’  the
UGC – including the underlying  right  holder’s  work  –is  covered  by  the
license to the platform. (It is also  the  method  employed  by  almost  all
users.) It is also beneficial to right holders  because  they  are  able  to
exercise different options  to  monetise  the  content  and  the  option  to
require that the video be taken down if it is objectionable,  such  as  when
the music is combined with offensive content.


Protected  recordings  are  identified  by  automatic  content   recognition
technology (such as YouTube’s  Content  ID  and  Audible  Magic’s  automated
content recognition system) and  can  be  associated  with  the  appropriate
right holder. This identification facilitates remuneration of  the  relevant
right holders, and enables them to require, in  a  very  small  minority  of
cases, that particular UGC – such as those which are offensive,  or  violate
the moral rights of the performers – be taken down.

  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


[Open question]


As explained above, the use of UGC is solved by licensing online  platforms.
This provides a legal environment  for  consumers  who  make  UGC  available
online, while enabling right holders to monetise their content.





  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]
UGC is being handled  successfully  by  licensing.  On  the  contrary,  some
proposals  mentioned,  such  as  an  exception  for  UGC,  would  be  highly
prejudicial.

We support the existing law which makes  it  clear  that  a  user  who  uses
another person’s work requires, except in rare and rather  narrowly  defined
cases, the permission of the copyright holder. There is no reason to  change
the law in that respect, especially when the right holders  have  relied  on
the law to enter into licenses that facilitate  the  dissemination  of  UGC,
while at  the  same  time  respecting  the  economic  and  moral  rights  of
creators.

In contrast, creating exceptions for  UGC,  as  sometimes  suggested,  would
render the existing license system  meaningless,  and  would  deprive  right
holders of the revenues they are currently obtaining. It would also fail  to
deal with the issue of moral rights and the need to  accommodate  mechanisms
for addressing such issues, which are currently managed under the  licensing
arrangements in place. The principal beneficiaries  of  an  exception  would
not be consumers, for  whom  nothing  would  change  in  comparison  to  the
current situation, but a number of big platforms  which  would  be  able  to
receive the proceeds of advertising for UGC without paying any  remuneration
to the owners of the content, including the artists. This would result in  a
transfer of value from creators to large technology companies.

We  agree  with  the  authors  of  the  recently  published  Study  On   The
Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights  in  the
Information Society that was prepared for the Commission that there  do  not
appear to be “sufficient problems in practice to  justify”  a  UGC  specific
exception (p. 542 of the Study). They also note  that  there  is  reason  to
believe that another legislative alternative to introduce  more  flexibility
into the list of exceptions “will practically give rise  to  more  questions
than it will answer and will lead to increased litigation”,  that  it  could
well lead to “unexpected but undesired results,”  and  that  “it  is  likely
that it would have an adverse impact on  the  functioning  of  the  Internal
Market” (p. 541 of the Study).

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]
As we explained, the market accommodates the use of UGC. Users who  wish  to
disseminate UGC  using  pre-existing  music  may  do  so  by  making  their
creations available through licensed platforms, which provide  the  benefit
of remunerating the performers and producers of the  underlying  works  and
respecting the moral rights of the performers  and,  in  very  rare  cases,
requiring the takedown  of  offensive  UGC  that  incorporate  pre-existing
recordings.


  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[56]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[57][58].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[59]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


Directive  2001/29/EC  provides  for  clear  exceptions  for  copyright  and
reprography. The private copying exception, in particular, makes clear  that
the exception is limited to individual, non-commercial uses, in  return  for
fair compensation. We are not aware  of  problems  resulting  from  national
legislation and case-law relating to the  actual  scope  of  the  exception,
except for the issue of legal source, which will be clarified  by  the  CJEU
in the near future.


€ NO OPINION


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[60]

€ YES – Please explain


The music industry’s priority has always  been  to  give  licenses  whenever
possible. However, today a large number of private  copies  continue  to  be
made from CDs or from online sources on digital devices and  media  such  as
mobile phones, smart phones, MP3 players and PCs for reasons such as  format
shifting or for the making of copies beyond licensed uses, or  as  a  result
of  the  mandatory  private  copying  exceptions  in  some  countries,   for
instance, in France or Belgium. For these copies, fair compensation must  be
provided as foreseen under Article 5(2)b of Directive 2001/29/EC whenever  a
private copying exception exists under national law.


The EU 2001/29 Directive provides clear  criteria  for  the  application  of
fair compensation, some of which  have  been  confirmed  by  the  CJEU.  The
possible harm to the right holders is only  one  of  the  possible  criteria
which can be taken into account to evaluate the level of fair  compensation.
In this context, harm includes the missed licensing  opportunities  for  the
right holders when copies cannot be  licensed.  The  Directive  also  states
(Recital 35) that no levies are due when the prejudice to the right  holders
would be minimal. There is no  need  to  clarify  these  points  further  in
legislation.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


We do not believe levies impact the  development  of  new  online  services,
including cloud services. A large variety of online services, some of  which
rely on cloud technology such  as  Spotify,  Deezer  and  iTunesMatch,  have
developed rapidly in the last  years;  while  more  services  are  emerging.
Levies are simply not interfering with this development.


Cloud services in particular involve, for the large  majority,  the  setting
up of a database and the making available of the copies to consumers.  These
activities require a license from right  holders,  and  such  licences  have
been granted to services such as iTunes  Match,  AmazonMP3  and  GooglePlay.
Copies made “in the cloud” within these  services  do  not  fall  under  the
scope of private copying and levies.


Conversely, we do not see how lower levies would have  any  positive  impact
on the development of legal services. As explained  above,  a  reduction  of
levies would only affect the revenues of right holders for copies  resulting
from situations where there is no effective licensing option.




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[61]

€ YES – Please explain


The levy amount could  appear  on  the  invoice  related  to  the  sales  of
products  subject  to  levies.  For  full  transparency  and  to  avoid  any
misunderstandings, such an indication should only  be  displayed  if  it  is
accompanied by a clear explanation about the purpose of the  levy  (i.e.  to
compensate the right holders, including the  artists,  for  the  copying  of
their creations). In addition to transparency, an advantage of  the  visible
levy would  be  to  help  enforce  the  joint  liability  of  manufacturers,
importers and retailers within the sales  chain,  as  each  element  of  the
chain could verify that the levy has been paid upwards.


The application of a visible levy can be left to voluntary  practice  or  to
national legislation.


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[62].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.


€ NO – Please explain


Levies are not an obstacle to the free movement of goods  and  services.  We
are not aware of cases of double payment. This is probably due to  the  fact
that EU countries have different exemption or refund systems in the case  of
exports or transit of products subject to levies.


The Opus judgment of the CJEU (case  C-462/09  Stichting  de  Thuiskopie  vs
Opus Supplies, 16 June 2011) recently clarified that, in cases  of  distance
sales occurring from one EU Member State to consumers located in another  EU
Member State where a private copying exception and levies are in place,  the
distance seller is liable for the payment of  the  levy  applicable  in  the
Member State where the consumer is located.  Consequently,  it  is  for  the
State where right holders are impacted by  private  copying  to  ensure  the
effective recovery of the levy, irrespective of whether the  media  retailer
is established in the same State or in another one.


This decision confirmed what already applies to the offline environment.  In
our view export or exemption schemes can also be  applied  in  the  case  of
online sales  of  equipment  and  devices  in  order  to  avoid  any  double
payments.


€ NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

[Open question]

The percentage of products sold to persons other  than  private  individuals
depends on the type of product, and we do not have data on an  EU  level  on
this point. However,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  relevant
criterion to assess the private nature of a copy is not the  status  of  the
person or entity buying the product, but the actual nature of the use, as  a
product bought by a company (such as smartphone, or tablet) can be  used  to
no small extent to copy protected content for private purposes.  The  extent
of private uses on multi-purpose devices can be assessed by market  studies.


Moreover,  national  levies  systems  include  systems  of   exemptions   or
reimbursement for  certain  categories  of  users,  thereby  avoiding  undue
payments.


  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

[Open question]

See response to Question 69

  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?


[Open question]


The  CJEU  has  already  clarified  a  number  of  important  elements,   in
particular the fact that levies  are  an  adequate  and  legitimate  way  to
compensate right holders for the private copying  of  protected  works,  the
application of levies in the country of establishment of consumers, and  the
liability of manufacturers for the payment of levies.  Another  decision  is
expected shortly on the application of legal source for the private  copying
exception. In our view, any further issues, if they arise, can be solved  by
clarifications from the CJEU, or by national legislation.


   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[63] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[64]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

The grant of exclusive rights to producers is essential to  enable  them  to
take the significant financial investment risks they  make  in  an  industry
where there is no guarantee of success. Furthermore,  this  gives  them  the
ability to enforce those rights against infringing parties.


The best measure the EU can take  to  ensure  that  authors,  producers  and
performers are properly remunerated is to tackle  piracy.  The  remuneration
of authors, performers and producers has been devastated  by  piracy.  Sales
of music have halved as a direct  consequence.  In  order  to  substantially
increase revenue  for  performers  and  authors  the  EU  needs  to  provide
adequate legislation to  enable  producers  and  publishers,  on  behalf  of
performers and authors, to fully tackle the piracy  which  has  caused,  and
continues to cause, so much damage to the industry.


Contractual freedom of all parties involved is and continues to be the  best
mechanism for addressing remuneration of performers. The decline in  revenue
over the last few years comes directly from the impact of piracy,  not  from
the contractual relationship between producer and performer.


The digital market has not offset the decline in physical  sales  caused  by
piracy, so there is no additional revenue in the value chain.


  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain why


See the response to Question 72. There is no demonstrable  need  for  action
at the EU level.


Existing EU and  national  law,  as  well  as  judicial  precedents  already
provide protection against unfair contractual practices.  Moreover,  in  the
music sector the best  guarantee  for  fair  contractual  practices  is  the
competitive pressure resulting from the intense competition that  exists  at
every level of the music industry. This is reinforced by the fact that  with
new digital production and distribution technologies the  barrier  to  entry
to the market of  music  production  is  very  low.  As  a  result  of  this
competitive environment,  companies  that  applied  unfair  practices  would
simply disappear, as they would not be able to sign new acts or  retain  old
ones.


€ NO OPINION


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

We believe that under the prevailing conditions, a  system  that  guarantees
contractual  freedom  is  the  best  means  to  achieve  fairness  and  fair
contractual practices. We do not believe  that  detailed  rules  interfering
with  the  parties’  freedom   to   contract   or   introducing   artificial
restrictions upon parties will benefit anyone,  as  ultimately,  they  would
reduce the production of new creative content  to  the  detriment  of  right
holders and consumers.


  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[65] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[66].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[67]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[68].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


The enforcement of IP rights should definitely be  made  more  efficient  on
several points. Directive 2004/48/EC was an  important  first  step  towards
harmonising  measures  and  procedures  for  civil  enforcement  in  Europe.
However, with the further rapid  development  of  Internet  technology,  the
Directive has now become inadequate to address the main forms  of  copyright
infringement online, which in the majority of cases involve  a  cross-border
element as internet sites are available in more than  one  country,  and  it
does not provide effective remedies for right holders.


IFPI estimates, based on measurement  data,  that  around  25%  of  internet
users  in  Europe  regularly  access  unlicensed  services  offering   music
content. Unlicensed operations  act  as  unfair  competition  to  legitimate
digital services as well as high street music retailers (many of  which  are
EU-based). EU-based companies such as Deezer, Spotify and WiMP have led  the
growth in streaming services in Europe and globally,  but  face  significant
challenges in further expanding  their  premium  offerings  when  unlicensed
free services are widespread. Piracy also limits  consumer  engagement  with
the many free ad-supported services, limiting the  advertising  revenues  of
legal services and thus harming their commercial viability.


Piracy  is  widely  acknowledged  as  a  dampening  force  on  new  services
launching, especially in countries with low  enforcement  and  high  piracy.
For example, when iTunes launched in Poland, the late Steve Jobs  said  that
iTunes’ biggest competitor was piracy rather than other  legal  services,  a
thought       shared       by        other        licensed        companies.
(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3805565.stm).


Digital piracy has both  a  direct  and  an  indirect  negative  impact.  It
directly impacts sales: the  majority  of  academic  and  empirical  studies
conclude that piracy negatively impacts  the  demand  for  licensed  content
(see,  for  example,  Smith/Telang’s  “Assessing  the  Academic   Literature
Regarding the Impact of Media Piracy on Sales”  (2012)).  Between  2004  and
2012, as digital services were substantially increasing, global sales  still
fell 30.2 percent, in large part due to piracy.  In  addition,  there  is  a
knock-on impact on the development of the  legitimate  online  market  as  a
whole and the ability of record companies to invest in music production  and
local repertoire, as well as in new talent. Tera  Consultancy’s  March  2010
study “Building a Digital Economy: The Importance  of  Saving  Jobs  in  the
EU’s Creative Industries” (“Tera Study”),  found  that  in  2008,  the  EU’s
creative industries that were most impacted  by  piracy  (film,  TV  series,
recorded music and  software)  experienced  retail  revenue  losses  of  €10
billion and losses of more than 185,000 jobs due to piracy.


Directive 2004/48/EC needs to be revised, in particular with respect to  the
following aspects:


-  Cross-border  injunctions  should  be  introduced.  Online  piracy  cases
typically involve a cross-border element with sites and  services  available
in more than one country, or having connections (e.g. operators, ISPs)  with
multiple jurisdictions. Often, right holders are required to  take  multiple
actions against the same infringing  service  (e.g.  The  Pirate  Bay),  and
there is currently no procedure to enable claims in different  countries  to
be consolidated in one jurisdiction. One option to remedy this situation  is
to allow an injunction against a specific service  obtained  in  one  Member
State to be enforced in another Member State, either directly or by  way  of
an expedited procedure.


- Article 8(3) of the Directive 2001/29/EC (which corresponds to Article  11
of the Directive 2004/48/EE)  should  be  properly  implemented  in  all  EU
Member States. Article 8(3) is not properly implemented  in  countries  such
as Germany, Poland, Czech  Republic,  Bulgaria,  Hungary  and  Sweden.  This
article allows in particular  to  obtain  injunctions  to  require  internet
access providers to stop providing access to  infringing  websites,  and  in
November 2013  the  Advocate  General  of  the  European  Court  of  Justice
confirmed that this form of injunction is available under Article  8(3)  and
is not incompatible with fundamental  rights.  In  countries  where  Article
8(3)  is  implemented  right  holders  have  been  successful  in  obtaining
injunctions against access providers  (e.g.  UK,  Italy,  Ireland,  Belgium,
Finland, Denmark and Spain). However, in  many  countries  these  procedures
take significant time and right holders incur high  costs  in  pursuing  the
cases with infringing websites and  services  remaining  accessible  in  the
meantime, causing significant  harm  to  the  right  holders.  We  therefore
believe  that  the  current  legislative  framework  could  be  improved  in
national  jurisdictions  by  providing  for  faster   and   more   efficient
procedures, ideally enabling right holders to obtain injunctions in  respect
of several sites in one action. It is currently not possible to obtain  such
a relief in all countries where Article 8(3) is implemented.  Also,  the  EU
legislative framework should take into account the  cross-border  nature  of
online piracy.  For  instance,  there  should  be  regulation  to  allow  an
injunction against services/intermediaries obtained in one Member  State  to
be enforced against other services/intermediaries in another  Member  State,
either directly or by way of an expedited court procedure.


- Provisions on injunctive relief should  be  improved  in  order  to  cover
subsequent IP/DNS  addresses  of  infringing  websites,  and  catalogue-wide
injunctive relief. For instance, The Pirate Bay  has  changed  domain  names
and registrations and IP addresses a number of  times  over  the  course  of
2013 in ongoing efforts to circumvent the block in certain  countries  where
the orders obtained did not cover changes of domain or IP addresses for  the
sites. The right holders should be able to notify  additional  IP  addresses
and URLs to ISPs in a regular basis when  an  original  blocking  order  has
been granted. It should also be guaranteed that obtaining  a  catalogue-wide
injunctive  relief  for  current  and  future  catalogue  is  not   rendered
unreasonably  onerous  or  practically  unworkable  due  to  the  number  of
infringements that must be proved by a right holder in order to obtain  such
relief. In addition, where  injunctions  are  granted  and  the  service  is
hosted by an EU based ISP that ISP  should  be  required  to  terminate  the
hosting account.


- Provisions on damages as provided in the Directive  2004/48/EE  should  be
improved to achieve their purpose: (i) right holders have to  be  adequately
compensated for the loss suffered, and (ii) infringers (and other  potential
infringers)  have  to  be  deterred  by  applying  sufficiently  significant
damages.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]
The current legal framework is not clear enough in allowing  for  sufficient
involvement of intermediaries. The  recording  industry  believes  that  all
intermediaries such as  Internet  service  providers,  advertising  brokers,
payment service providers, domain  name  registrars,  etc.  in  the  digital
economy have a responsibility to cooperate in order  to  support  legitimate
digital commerce and  fight  piracy.  We  therefore  suggest  improving  the
following measures:

- Cooperation required from all intermediaries. All  intermediaries  in  the
online environment  (search  engines,  advertisers  and  payment  providers)
should contribute to  curb  piracy  online.  The  EU  legislative  framework
should consider that all intermediaries  play  an  important  role  when  it
comes to online piracy, which means they bear  certain  responsibilities  in
tackling the problem. Examples of what this should include are  as  follows:
(a) search engines should stop directing consumers to infringing content  or
services but in any event should change their  prioritisation  criteria  (by
promoting legal services and significantly demoting  pirate  sites  where  a
reasonable volume of infringement  notices  are  sent);  (b)  advertisers/ad
networks should stop serving advertisements to infringing  sites  that  make
substantial sums from unlicensed content; (c) payment  providers  should  be
required to stop providing payment services to illegal sites  and  services;
and (d) App stores should remove  Apps  which  are  designed  to  facilitate
piracy.

- Protection  against  liability  only  for  truly  neutral  intermediaries.
Protection against  liability  under  the  E-Commerce  safe  harbour  regime
should only apply to  “truly  neutral  intermediaries”.   The  most  serious
problem right holders encounter with notice and action is that many  of  the
platforms and services seeking to take advantage of  the  safe  harbours  in
Article 14 are  not  properly  within  the  definition  of  hosting  service
providers,  nor  are  they  true  intermediaries  (e.g.  unlicensed   locker
services and BitTorrent sites).  Many of  these  services  are  structurally
infringing sites, enabling the wide dissemination of  unauthorised  content,
and whose business model depends on right holders not being able  to  locate
and notify infringing URLs fast enough before they are re-posted.   However,
according to ECJ case law  and  the  EU  legislative  framework,  protection
against liability can only  granted  to  “merely  technical,  automatic  and
passive” services. This should therefore be clarified further. 

- Requirement for ISPs to keep public  databases  updated.  ISPs  should  be
required to keep public databases  (e.g.  Domain  Tools,  RIPE)  updated  to
allow right holders to identify which ISP is  providing  internet  service. 
The vast bulk of  the  online  piracy  problem  originates  from  sites  and
services for which there is no identified  corporate  entity  or  individual
against whom civil litigation can be taken.  The  difficulties  which  right
holders face – beyond the above mentioned lack of a legal method  to  obtain
the details – are  (1)  incorrect  or  fake  details,  or  even  no  details
displayed on public databases such as the RIPE  database  or  Domain  Tools,
and (2) incorrect or fake details held by ISPs.   In  addition,  sites  move
from one ISP to another very quickly in order to evade enforcement.   Unless
ISPs are required to keep public databases accurate and up  to  date,  right
holders are deprived of any means of  identifying  the  persons  responsible
for the infringing services. 


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


The balance between copyright enforcement and  protection  of  private  life
and personal data has been addressed extensively  in  case  law  (e.g.  CJEU
Promusicae case) and in underlying legislation

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


We do not see what benefits a single EU Copyright Title would  provide,  and
how it could be put in practice. A single EU Title makes sense in the  field
of rights which are obtained  on  the  basis  of  a  registration  (such  as
patents or trademarks). The very nature of those industrial property  rights
is different from copyright, as  their  protection  itself  depends  on  the
registration system, which includes the examination of  the  subject  matter
(e.g. a sign, or an invention) to be protected. For these rights,  a  single
title  is  an  alternative  to  long  and  expensive  multiple  registration
procedures in individual Member States.


Copyright is inherently different  as  its  existence  is  not  based  on  a
registration procedure and arises from the mere creation of  a  work.  If  a
single EU copyright title  was  introduced  as  an  optional  system  to  be
applied on the top of national copyright systems, we do not  think  that  it
would be adopted, because it would duplicate the  protection  which  already
exists at national level and across Europe. On the other  hand,  if  such  a
title was mandatory, this would require a full  harmonisation  of  copyright
throughout the EU, which is neither necessary nor achievable.


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

The core legal framework underlying the online music market,  in  particular
Directive 2001/29/EC which sets out the necessary rights and the  protection
of technology in the digital environment, is generally satisfactory, and  is
sufficiently harmonised at EU level. It provides  an  acceptable  degree  of
legal certainty as well  as  flexibility  for  the  future.  Efforts  should
concentrate on the proper  implementation  and  enforcement  of  this  vital
framework


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]
One area in which the EU could have an immediate and positive impact on  the
copyright sectors would be to introduce a system of tax  credits  to  assist
with the discovery, development and production costs of new artists.  A  tax
credit system would incentivise companies to take additional  risks  on  new
European  talent,  would  boost  cultural  diversity,  and  lead   to   more
investment in talent at a local level, all the while boosting  the  European
economy.

Another important issue is to extend reduced  VAT  rates  for  the  cultural
sectors to cover recorded music, which currently does not benefit  from  the
reduced rates that other sectors do.  Additionally,  extending  the  reduced
VAT rates to both online and offline products is important, as  the  product
consumed is the same: music. Reduced and harmonised VAT rates would lead  to
more consumer interest in purchasing music (at lower prices) and would be  a
way of promoting Europe’s culture. It would also bring the music  sector  in
line with other creative and cultural sectors.

rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.

reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to

joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending

C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] Article 5.2(b) of the 2001 Copyright Directive makes it clear the
making of private copies is not allowed for commercial ends, therefore
prohibiting any sale of the copies made.
[30] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[31] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
