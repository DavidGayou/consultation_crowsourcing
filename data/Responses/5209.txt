The reply contains answers to questions 8, 10, 11 and 12. Besides these
specific comments, which reflect my own personal views (only) on the
definitions of the economic rights, I refer to the reply of the European
Copyright Society, to which I also am a signatory.




  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market





B.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope  of  what  needs
to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established  by  Directive  2001/29/EC[1]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection  of  software[2]
and databases[3].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[4] which are essential for the transmission of  digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or  prohibit  the  making  of  copies[5],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[6]. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital  transmissions
and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[7]. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which  has
to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”  by
the online  service  provider.  A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations  –
      i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?



NO  –  Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[8])
A major problem with the current rights regime, whether it applies to cross-
border situations, or is limited to a certain territory, is that the rights
are defined according to the nature of the act of use and not its functions
or effects. This way of defining the rights could lead to just results if
the nature of the acts somehow reflects the effects, but the rapid
technological development implies that this is increasingly far from being
the case today. To illustrate, related to the question of the clarity of
the “making available” right in cross-border situations, whether which one
of the “targeting” or the “country of origin” approaches that are to be
preferred, should depend on whether there is a need for applying the
different territorial copyrights in the cross-border situations or if the
right holders interests would be sufficiently secured by a principle of
country of origin. The latter will in its turn depend on whether economic
and legal conditions are sufficiently harmonized in order to avoid attempts
to circumvent the legal protection for right holders in the digital
environment. These considerations are not properly addressed when the
question becomes whether “the act of “making available” [does] happen in
the country of the upload only, in each of the countries where the content
is potentially accessible, [or] in each of the countries where the content
is effectively accessed”. Symptomatically, the CJEU in its decision in
Football Dataco II failed to discuss the implications of applying a
multitude of territorial rights instead of one single right, concentrating
instead on the nature of the concept of “re-utilization” in Article 7 of
the Database Directive and whether this concept implies that the data on a
website is re-utilized by persons targeted by the data transmission. The
problem in this respect is not as such the lack of clarity of concepts like
“making available” and “re-utilization”, but the fact that the nature of
the acts of use gives little guidance as to how to solve the underlying
question; should Internet transmissions involve the multiplicity of
territorial rights or only one right (the right of the country of origin).

Thus, the problem raised in question 8 reveals a more general problem of
which there can be given many examples, and it is likely to presume that we
yet only have seen the top of the iceberg. The problems raised in questions
10-12 infra are equally illustrative. An example not directly covered by
this questionnaire is a controversy currently pending before Norwegian
courts, regarding whether the right clearance regime developed for
retransmissions of broadcasts is applicable in a changed technological
environment where the distributor does not “retransmit” broadcasts already
made available to the public, but receives the signals encrypted from the
broadcaster and transmits them to the public. Two lower court decisions
have stated that the concept of retransmission does not apply in this
situation. The result of the decisions is that right holders, both
domestically and abroad, who used to receive remuneration for cable
distribution through the relevant right holder organization (Norwaco) are
left without compensation. The question whether this is an intended and
desirable effect of a mere technological change, is left without discussion
in the decisions which are exclusively based on the nature of the relevant
act of use – retransmission of broadcasts.

Problems of the kind outlined here will not disappear by way of clarifying
the content of the concepts or adding new concepts based on the nature of
the use as new problems only will arise. Thus, there is a pressing need for
a different approach to the economic rights which abandons the attempts to
positively define the scope of the exclusive rights by describing the
nature of the act of uses. Reference can be made to Daniel Gervais, Towards
s New Core International Copyright Norm: The Reverse Three-Step Test, 9
Marquette Intellectual Property Law Review (2005) 1, proposing to base the
economic rights in copyright on a reverse reading of the Three Step Test. I
will also point to my own suggestion to replace the current “bundle of
economic rights” with pertaining exceptions and limitations with an
overriding norm of an exclusive right to a reasonable exploitation of the
work, followed by a pertaining catalogue of examples and specifications of
what is/what is not reasonable, focusing on the functions and effects of
the exploitation rather than the nature of the use. An outline of this
model was published (in Norwegian) in Ole-Andreas Rognstad, Opphavsrettens
innhold i en multimedieverden, Nordisk Immateriellt Rättskydd (NIR) (2009)
531, and a further elaboration of it (in English) is scheduled to be
published this spring. Under the proposed model, the question whether
multiple territorial rights or one single right shall apply may be
addressed more directly, connected to legislation on choice of law, instead
of being implied in the regulation of where the different kinds of actions
determined by the nature of the use shall be considered to take place.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


[In particular if you a service  provider  or  a  right  holder:]  Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


YES

The situation described here illustrates the same problem as outlined under
question 8. The overlapping of the right of making available to the public
and the reproduction right, results from the fact that the current rights
regime is based on the nature of certain acts of use and not the functions
or effects of the use. Thus, as indicated in the question, two rights
regularly apply to one single act of economic exploitation in the digital
environment. This might create problems for service providers and right
holders, but is not least a cause for concern from an end user perspective.

One example to illustrate, also related to the next question (11). It
follows from the recent case law of the CJEU (case C-466/12, Svensson) that
“the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely available on
another website does not constitute ‘an act of communication to the
public’” (see the conclusion of the decision). The rationale behind the
ruling is that “the making available the works concerned by means of a
clickable link … does not lead to the works in question being communicated
to a new public” as the “public targeted by the initial communication
consisted of all potential visitors to the site concerned, since, given
that access to the works on that site was not subject to any restrictive
measures, all Internet users could therefore have free access to them”
(para. 26 and 27). The Court also emphasized that this applies even in
situations where “Internet users click on the link at issue” and “the work
appears in such a way as to give the impression that it is appearing on the
site on which that link is found, whereas in fact that work comes from
another site”, because “since there is no new public, the authorization of
the copyright holders is in any event not required for such a communication
to the public” (para. 29 and 30).

Now, for the sake of consistency this rationale should apply also to
situations where access to the material “freely available” on the Internet
is provided for by use of different means than links to the third party
website. For example: Instead of providing a link to the third party
website from where a document, eg. a photograph, is freely available, a
Facebook user downloads the photograph on her own machine and creates a
link to it on her Facebook page. Neither in this situation the link will
target a new public, since the photograph is freely available from the
third party website. This way of providing access to the photograph to the
same public that can access it from the “original” website will, however,
come in conflict with the reproduction right. For the average user of the
Internet this distinction is incomprehensible, and the legal situation is a
solid proof of that the current copyright legislation is far from being
technology neutral. From a functional perspective, the very method of
providing access to material already made available on the Internet should
not matter. The end user is concerned about the functionality, not the
nature of the acts of use, and the current rights regime threatens the
legitimacy of the copyright legislation in the eyes of the general public.
It should also be emphasized that the interests of the right holder is not
affected by the alternative method of providing access. Also in the former
situation, where a link is provided to the third party website, the
provider of the link may download the photograph to her own machine, since
private copying is not an infringing act (Article 5(2)b) of Directive
29/2001/EC). The download in the second situation will, however, not be
considered as private copying, since it will represent the basis for the
making available to the public. The result is, however, also from a right
holder’s perspective, exactly the same in both situations. Initiatives
should be taken in order to get rid of this anomaly of copyright law,
stemming from the fact that the current economic rights in copyright are
based on the nature of the acts of use and not their functions.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases  are  pending  before  the  CJEU[9]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[10] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.


Should the provision of a hyperlink leading  to  a  work  or  other  subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


NO Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,  or
under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does  not  amount  to
an act of communication to the public – or to a new public,  or  because  it
should be covered by a copyright exception)

It should be obvious that ordinary informational linking to works freely
made available on the Internet is legal – otherwise the essential
functionality of the Internet would be hampered. The result now to a
certain extent seems to follow from the CJEU decision in the Svensson case,
se question 10 supra. The legal ground for the result is, however,
questionable. An evident problem with hyperlinks is the double functioning
of links. On the one hand it is a reference to a work already made
available on the Internet. On the other hand a hyperlink represents a
function in itself as it undeniable has the effect that the user gets
access to the work by activating the link. The analogy to a footnote in a
book therefore only tells one part of the story. In the Svensson case, this
aspect is recognized by the CJEU as the Court, emphasizing that “for there
to be an ‘act of communication’, it is sufficient, in particular, that a
work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons forming
that public may access it”, held that consequently, “the provision of
clickable links to protected works must be considered to be ‘making
available’ and therefore an ‘act of communication’” (case C-466/12, para.
19 and 20). With reference to its earlier case law stating that “by the
term ‘public’, [Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29] … refers to an
indeterminate number of potential recipents and implies, moreover a fairly
large number of persons”, the CJEU confirmed that the manager of a website
containing clickable links “is making a communication to the public” (para.
21-23). As pointed out under question 10, however, as the CJEU found that
the links did not lead to the works in question being communicated to a new
public, that is “a public that was not taken into account by the copyright
holders when they authorized the initial communication to the public”, the
conclusion was that “the authorization of the copyright holders is in any
event not required for such a communication to the public” (para. 24-30).

By relying on the concept of a ‘new public’, the CJEU found a way to deal
with the links which on the one hand leads to the result that linking to
material freely available on the Internet is lawful, while on the other
hand clickable links that “makes it possible for users on the site on which
that link appears to circumvent restrictions put in place by the site on
which the protected work appears in order to restrict public access to that
work to the latter site’s subscribers only”, will need the right holders’
authorization (para. 31). Thus, the new public criteria strikes a certain
balance, but is controversial for other reasons. History has shown that it
is extremely difficult to draw the distinction between the original and the
new public/audience, and already under the 1948 Brussel revision of the
Berne Convention the distinction was considered as unusable as a criterion
for dealing with retransmissions of broadcasts, leading to the formulation
of Article 11bis(1)(ii) which let the right to retransmissions depend on
that the communication is made by an organization other than the original
one, and not on whether it reached a new public or not. When the CJEU now
in a series of cases has introduced the ‘new public criterion’ as the main
factor for delineating the right of communication to the public, it may
claimed to be ignorant to the problems this criterion has created in the
past and undoubtedly also will in the future.

The introduction of the criterion is, however, a symptom of the major
deficit of the current rights structure, pointed out in the foregoing,
namely that the rights are defined according to the nature of the acts of
use and not their functions or effects. The underlying facts of the
Svensson case are illustrating. The base problem of that case is not about
linking but the lawfulness of news surveillance services in the digital
environment. The consequence of the CJEU ruling is that such services do
not need the authorization of the right holders to the articles (the
journalists) as long as the service is based on links to articles freely
made available on the Internet. Again it is possible to question the
consistency and technological neutrality of the CJEU decision, since a
different choice of method for providing the customers with access to the
news articles could have led to a different result. In the case, the news
surveillance company Retriever Sverige AB operated a website providing its
clients with lists of clickable links to articles published by other
websites and informing the clients about new results matching their search
terms in an email or SMS sent to the clients. If Retriever instead of
providing the clients with a list of links to the articles had downloaded
them from the websites freely available and attached them to the email
informing the clients of the new results, the right holders would have had
a claim against Retriever on the basis of the reproduction right, even if
Retriever had deleted the articles from their servers immediately after
having carried out the operation. Neither in this situation would the works
in question have reached a new public, since the articles were freely
available on the Internet. But the method for giving the clients access to
the articles would, on the basis of the reproduction right, determine the
lawfulness of the news surveillance service. This proves again that the
current economic rights regime is not technology neutral and that the
lawfulness of the economic activity in question – here the news
surveillance service – depends solely on the characterization of the acts
of use. A fact concealed by the CJEU judgment in the Svensson case is that
Retriever receives remuneration from its clients based on the clients’
downloads of the articles in question. This illustrates that Retriever is
using the articles made available on the Internet to exploit a new market,
and the question becomes whether the right holders should be entitled to a
share of this exploitation. This problem is not properly addressed when
hyperlinks are dealt with under the ‘new public’ criterion and the method
for how the news surveillance activity is carried out becomes decisive for
whether or not the activity requires an authorization by the right holder.
This is not to say that the result of the Svensson case necessarily should
be different – only that under the current regulation, it is the
description of the operations carried out that determines the lawfulness of
the acts of use under copyright law, and not the functions and effects of
the operations.

To conclude, the current regulation, including the new public requirement
is not a well fit tool to handle issues regarding hyperlinks. In the short
run there is any case a need for a default rule on the EU level, explicitly
granting immunity to ordinary use of information systems like links and
search engines without having to depend on the highly ambiguous new public
criterion.

Should  the  viewing  of  a  web-page  where  this  implies  the   temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general,  or
under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.  because  it  is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)

The viewing of a web-page in general should not be subject to the specific
authorization of the right holder. It lies in the very nature of the
Internet as an information medium that the public can visit websites,
browsing and viewing the contents of them. The only reason why this is even
a question is the extension of the reproduction right to temporary copying,
which in itself is a result of what has been emphasized many times in the
foregoing – that the current rights regime is based on a description of the
nature of certain acts of use and not their functions. The fact that a
simple question whether the viewing of a website is allowed requires an
assessment whether the very complicated and ambiguous conditions in Article
5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC are fulfilled, is perhaps the most obvious
symptom and indication of that there is something seriously wrong with the
present system. The only question which should be subject to discussion is
whether users should be banned from viewing and browsing content illegally
posted on the Internet. This is a policy question, involving also the issue
of copyright enforcement as it may be held that a right to ban the viewing
of copyright content available on the Internet is not enforceable.  In the
end it is a question of to what extent the right holder should be entitled
to control the access to the works. This should be regulated in a
comprehensive matter, also including the protection of technical protection
measures, and should not be “hidden” in the incomprehensibly complicated
provisions of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.
