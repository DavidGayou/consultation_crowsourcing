     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

   NGO, AIPPI is an Organization dedicated to the development and improvement of the
   regimes for the protection of intellectual property (including copyright).
   AIPPI is a politically neutral, non-profit organisation, domiciled in Switzerland which
   currently has almost 9,000 members representing more than 100 countries. The objective
   of AIPPI is to improve and promote the protection of intellectual properly on both an
   international and national basis. It pursues this objective by working for the development,

                                                                                            6

   expansion and improvement of international and regional treaties and agreements and
   also of national laws relating to intellectual property, including copyright. It operates by
   conducting studies of existing national laws and proposes measures to achieve
   harmonisation of these laws on an international basis. The Members of AIPPI are people
   actively interested in intellectual property protection on a national or international level.
   They include lawyers, patent attorneys and trademark agents (both outside and in house
   counsel) as well as judges, academics, scientists and engineers. They also include
   corporations and other IP owners.
   For its annual session of the Executive AIPPI’s Committee, so-called “Working
   Questions” (also: “Qs”) are formulated. They concern areas of intellectual property law,
   where AIPPI sees a need for international discussion and harmonization. Each year, i.a.
   one “Q” from the area of Copyright is dealt with at the Executive Committee session. The
   process of discussing a “Q” within AIPPI starts with Working Guidelines, followed by
   Reports of National Groups (Group Reports), answering the questions set out in the
   Working Guidelines, and a Summary Report of the Group Reports before the session of the
   Executive Committee. At the session, a Resolution is discussed and passed by majority
   vote. Examples for copyright are “Q216” and “Q216B”, both on
   “Exceptions to copyright protection and the permitted uses of copyright works in the hi-
   tech and digital sectors”. The Working Guidelines, Group Reports, Summary Reports and
   the Resolutions may be found here:

   In the present contribution, where possible reference to Resolutions have been made,
   which contain AIPPI's position as adopted by its Executive Committee. Where no reference
   to a Resolution is made, the present contribution reflects the opinion of a number of
   experienced copyright practitioners who are members of AIPPI (as listed above).

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of



16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21

(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

AIPPI does not have a common position yet. Also, AIPPI did not discuss this extensively on
the basis of a Working Question, leading to a voted resolution prepared by reports of AIPPI’s
national groups. See above I. for an explanation of AIPPI’s process to adopt voted
resolutions on intellectual property policy issues.
One view is that the material scope of the “making available” right is unclear, particularly in
the context of modern audiovisual applications. Where the situation also has a cross-border
element, additional complications of international public law arise. These might indeed
usefully be addressed by a country-of-origin principle, which would make it possible to obtain
a pan-European license at source and thus reduce the business costs and risks (and resulting
impoverishment of services available to EU consumers) of dealing with differing copyright
regimes. The application of such a principle also potentially raises new complications,
however, related to the material scope of the making available right in the country of origin
and the risk of service providers relocating to the Member State with the least onerous
copyright regime.
However, these questions, although important, are relatively minor compared to more basic
questions about the material scope of the “making available” right, i.e. whether a particular
act qualifies as one or more communications to the public and, if so, by whom. In our view,
there is considerable scope for clarification of the material scope of the right, particularly in
the sphere of audiovisual distribution.
Another view expressed within AIPPI is that the scope of the making available right in cross
border situations is sufficiently clear. It should not be further regulated by the legislator, but
its interpretation should be left to the courts. The CJEU has the last word, if an exploitation

22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

                                                                                                              12
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
right harmonized on the EU level by directives is at stake. This is in particular true for the
making available right as part of the right of communication to the public (Art. 3 Copyright
Directive 2001/29/EC), but also for the re-production right (Art. 2 Copyright Directive
2001/29/EC) and for the distribution right (Art. 4 Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC).
Naturally, the CJEU has always paid particular attention to the establishment of an internal
market and in particular a digital single market.
It is desirable that consumers can use on-demand services even when on holidays or when
travelling for business outside their country of residence. For, this, however, one does not
have to change the “targeting” approach. It is sufficient to interpret the notion of “public” in
a flexible way, in order for the consumer to remain part of the public of his or her country of
residence, While this is already common practice for a lot of on-demand services, AIPPI is
also confident that case law will find this solution if necessary without the legislator having to
act.
Also, one would have to critically check, if from the side of on-demand service providers there
is a relevant interest in a pan-European service. Demand from users for content seems to be
quite different in different member states.
Furthermore, AIPPI does not think that changing the making available right from the
“targeting” approach to the “country of origin” approach is a good idea. The country of
origin principle for satellite broadcasts pursuant the cable and satellite directive 93/83/EEC
should not be used as a model for the making available right. Satellite broadcasts and making
available services cover different scenarios, which should not be treated alike:
-      Broadcasts and in particular satellite broadcasts belong to a “push” concept of use,
       while the making available right is part of an interactive on-demand “pull” concept.
       In interactive “pull” scenarios the user is an integral part of the rights’ act of usage
       as such. Thus, the country of origin cannot be the only place of use. Rather, the
       targeted place of use is of utmost relevance.
-      AIPPI also has certain doubts if the introduction of a country of origin principle solely
       for EU origin for the making available right would be contrary to Art. 8 WCT. This
       would mean to treat services within EU origin differently than services with non-EU
       origin and to create a “split” making available right.
-      Copyright law in the EU does not seem to be sufficiently harmonized to avoid a race
       to the bottom in case of a country of origin principle. This is in particular true for
       moral rights, but also for copyright contract law protecting the author and for
       enforcement in practice, despite the EU Enforcement Directive 2004/48.
-      Finally, a country of origin principle for the making available right will naturally
       enlarge the territorial scope of licensing and thus the licensing fees. Small and
       medium sized companies with little selling power regarding the territory of the EU as
       a whole but with importance in single member states will be put on a disadvantage
       compared to larger right holders with considerable selling power if they do not
       happen to be located in the country of origin. Small and medium size right holders will
       not be able to increase the price for a communitywide license in a proportionate way.


Finally, AIPPI would like to note that the target approach is common also in other
jurisdictions outside the EU. Under Canadian law, the application of the Canadian Copyright
Act follows the standard of the “real and substantial connection” test. This means that the
connecting factors are both the point of origin and the point of reception.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
X YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
From a user´s perspective, the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment usually creates problems if those two rights are
exercised by separate entities. Especially if only one of the rights is represented by a
collecting society while the other is exercised individually.
However, in general, the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment has not created any problems. All relevant rights (in particular the
making available right and the reproduction right) are usually in one hand, i.e. in the hand of
the licensor. As stated by the Commission, existing problems for copyrights in musical works
(not musical neighbouring rights) for internet platforms will be solved by the upcoming
Directive on Collecting societies. Otherwise, they should be left to the courts (see German
case Court of Appeal Munich decision of April 29, 2010, file no. 29 U 3698/09, published in

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
In general, the provision of a hyperlink to a work that has been made available elsewhere on
the Internet, should not be considered a communication to the public or reproduction of the
work. This may be different in certain specific circumstances, which will be discussed below.
Moreover, there may be circumstances in which the rightholder may oppose the publication
of the hyperlink on non-copyright grounds.
At an Executive Committee meeting in October 2011in Hyderabad, India, AIPPI adopted a
resolution Q216B on Exceptions to Copyright Protection and the Permitted Uses of Copyright
Works in the Hi-tech and Digital sectors
(https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/216B/RS216BEnglish.pdf). This contains the
following resolution:
“Providing user-activated hyperlinks to a copyright work, in and of itself, should not be
considered a reproduction of the work. Also, providing such hyperlinks to a copyright work
that has already been made available to the public on the Internet with the authorization of the
relevant rights holder does not, by itself, constitute a further act of making such a work
available to the public. However, providing hyperlinks may attract liability by contributing to
acts of copyright infringement in relation to the targeted work.”
This statement raises the question of when a copyright work “has already been made
available to the public on the internet”. In general, this occurs at the moment the work is
uploaded to a location that is technically accessible to the public. It is this initial uploading of
the work rather than any subsequent hyperlinks to it that is the copyright-restricted act

VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
subject to the permission of the rightholder. It is not required that this upload location is
widely known, nor is it required that the work is actually accessed or even likely to be
accessed. It is conceivable, however, that a work can be uploaded to the internet in such a
way that it is technically inaccessible to the public, for example because it is placed in a
password-protected directory or a session-ID. In such a case, it is conceivable that a
hyperlink might be constructed in such a way as to enable access to a work that was
previously inaccessible.
Differing opinions are possible as to whether the publication of such a hyperlink would
qualify as an act of communication to the public of the work thus made accessible.
As the AIPPI resolution acknowledges, there are circumstances in which the act of
hyperlinking to a protected work may contribute to acts of copyright infringement. This may
lead to liability on the part of the publisher of the hyperlink. In that case, the rightholder
might also demand removal of the illegal hyperlink. Although this is not quite the same thing
as the right to authorise the hyperlink as the question phrases it (which seems to use
authorisation in the sense of giving a copyright license), it would amount to a de facto right to
prohibit the hyperlink.
Also, non-EU jurisdictions treat hyperlinks in a differentiated way under copyright law. A
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, albeit pertaining to assessment of communication
to the public within the context of defamation, highlights the uncertainty as to whether or not
hyperlinking attracts liability. It likely depends what is the nature of the link.

In our opinion, the downloading and viewing of a web page on end-user terminal equipment
should not be subject to authorisation of the rightholder, because it is covered by the
exemption for transient or incidental copying as part of a network transmission or legal use.
To the extent that it is not covered by this exemption, the exemption should be broadened to
cover it. But the exception should not cover temporary reproductions of content made
available in a clearly infringing way, in case the user is able to identify this illegality
beforehand. The right holder’s copyright interests are sufficiently protected by his ability to
authorise the communication to the public that precedes the downloading and viewing of the
page by the user.

4.        Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
     NO OPINION


16.        What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
The answer to this question can vary depending on the benefits offered for registration and
the actual consequences of non-registration.
From a right holder’s perspective, the advantages of such a system would lie in the fixed set
of rules that would facilitate proof of title and, depending on the rules, allow damages to be
set more easily. The most interesting advantage could lie in making prosecution of
infringements more effective in cases where registered works or other protected subject
matter were used without authorisation.
17.        What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Registration could create a significant administrative burden and costs for right holders in
sectors where a great number of items would need to be registered, notably sound recordings
and photography but also in the broadcasting sector (footage in archives). Some of these
sectors have industry or sector specific registration systems in place that appear to function
satisfactorily, so that a second, legal obligation to register works may be burdensome.
In addition, the problems a compulsory registration system promises to resolve may be less
pressing than often claimed and the practical difficulties in obtaining information about
actual rights ownership may be overstated. Unauthorized exploitation may be the result of
failed license agreement discussion as much as of prospective licensees looking in vain for a
person or entity to grant them a license.
Usually, where search tools exist, protected content can be identified, including the right
holder to be addressed (like in the field of text publishing where search tools have been

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             18
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
available for a long time).This is in particular true for audio-visual content like feature films,
TV programs etc. Here, opening and closing credits are used which usually identify the right
holder.
The problems begin where such search engines fail, namely in the field of picture search. One
of the reasons why so much visual content is being used without proper license simply lies in
the fact that a given picture for which a license is sought cannot be easily matched against
picture databases.
This difficulty could not be resolved by registration requirements because the picture search
would fail to work in the register for the same reasons that it fails on the internet. This, by the
way, applies mainly to stills like photographs, since in moving pictures right holder is
ordinarily identifiable through the opening or closing credits, (see above).
Furthermore, especially in the fields of film and TV, photography and sound recordings, there
exists a large quantity of protectable material available in archives but never meant to be
commercially exploited.
Registering released material only and leaving this bulk of protectable archive material
unregistered, may have as a result that those with access to archives would rather use
unpublished material instead of the registered items, so that the right holder in the registered
work or other subjected matter may not even be able to benefit from the advantages offered by
registration.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
In light of the answers concerning Questions 16 and 17 above, the strongest incentive for
right holders could lie in attaching a broader scope of protection than what is the current
acquis communautaire and what is required by international conventions to those willing to
register their works, notably with respect to damages.



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the

systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

environment?

                                                                                                                20
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
1) This resolution addresses the general issue of the term of copyright protection, particularly
the need for a harmonised maximum term and whether different types of copyrighted work
should enjoy the same term of copyright protection.
2) This resolution does not relate to moral rights, related rights and/or traditional knowledge.
3) AIPPI has previously studied questions where the term of copyright has been addressed to
some extent.
4) In the resolution on Question Q73 “Legal and Economic Significance of Industrial Design
Protection” (1985) it was stated that the protection of copyright law should be given to these
works for a reduced period, which could be fixed at 25 years.
5) In the resolution on Question 57A ”Protection of Computer-Software and Integrated
Circuits” (1985) it was noted that the Berne Convention (BC) sets the term to the lifetime of
the author plus 50 years after his death and AIPPI was of the opinion that such a duration was
not appropriate in the field of computer software, and that it might be necessary to provide a
shorter duration in line with the reduced term of protection for photographs and works of
applied art.
6) In the national reports and discussions preceding the resolution on Question 231"The
interplay between design and copyright protection for industrial products" (2012) almost all
groups were of the opinion that the term of copyright protection for industrial products,
insofar as these are protected by copyright, should be the same as the term of protection for
other copyrighted works.
Considering that:
1) Almost all the national Groups report that their respective countries have ratified the BC as
amended, TRIPS 1994 and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT), which means that there is a
substantial level of harmonisation in respect of the minimum term of copyright.
2) Over the years the term of copyright has, with few notable exceptions, been constantly
extended in almost all countries.
3) There is no consensus among the national Groups in respect of what an adequate term for
copyright should be and whether such term could or should differ between different types of
work.
4) However, there is a substantial support among the national Groups in favor of a maximum
term for copyright. Among the concerns raised were a continued extension of the term of
copyright, competition between countries/regions in respect of offering best protection for
copyright holders and distortion of the international market for copyrighted works.
Resolves that:
1) A maximum term of copyright should be introduced in relevant international treaties
governing this aspect of national copyright laws.
2) The maximum term of copyright should not exceed 70 years pma of the last deceased
author when the term is calculated on the basis of the life of the natural person.
3) Different types of copyrighted work should in principle enjoy the same term of copyright
protection.
4) The term of copyright for industrial products and other applied art, insofar as these are
protected by copyright, should not differ from the term normally applied to other copyrighted
works.


                                                                                                21

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            22
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
So far, AIPPI has discussed the need for new limitations and exceptions in particular in the
digital world only on a very general level. Resolution Q216 2010 Paris (see for the process of
resolutions above I.) states the following:

“For limitations and exceptions to copyright protection in the digital environment, the Three-
Step Test referred to above sets the generally-accepted standard. In this regard, national
laws should be harmonised relying on the Three-Step Test.”

The Resolution may be downloaded here:
https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/216/RS216English.pdf

A further Resolution Q216B 2010 Hyderabad further specified for some scenarios:

“1) In respect of limitations and exceptions to copyright protection, national laws should be
harmonized relying on the Three-Step Test. Due to cultural differences amongst states, a full
harmonization may be very difficult to achieve. Harmonization should at least be achieved for
some of the limitations and exceptions applicable for Internet uses adopting the following
guidelines:
a) The system of limitations and exceptions should be sufficiently flexible to treat new
technologies and emerging business models.
b) The system must provide for adequate legal certainty in the application of the limitations or
exceptions.
c) The system should have minimum standards for compliance, for example a non-exhaustive
list of specific Internet-related limitations and exceptions, in particular as set out below.

2) … (Resolution on UGC providers, see below questions 58 et seq.)

3) Providing user-activated hyperlinks to a copyright work, in and of itself, should not be
considered a reproduction of the work. Also, providing such hyperlinks to a copyright work
that has already been made available to the public on the Internet with the authorization of the
relevant rights holder does not, by itself, constitute a further act of making such a work
available to the public. However, providing hyperlinks may attract liability by contributing to
acts of copyright infringement in relation to the targeted work.

4) Search engines, when helping users to find and access copyright works that have already
been made available to the public on the internet with the authorisation of the right holder
should be able to rely on exceptions or limitations and, beyond these on implied licenses, if
provided by national jurisdictions.

5) In respect of transient or temporary copies, there should be specific limitations or
exceptions to copyright infringement as follows:
a) In relation to a computer program, the making of transient or temporary copies should be
exempted from copyright protection, where such copies are necessary to perform or secure a
lawful use of the said computer program.
b) In relation to all other works transiently or temporarily reproduced in an end user’s
computer memory, the making of such transient or temporary copies should be exempted
from liability for copyright infringement, where the copies are supportive of a lawful use, and
the technical means employed are content neutral, and the copies have no economic
significance.


                                                                                             24
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
6) Copyright exceptions and limitations should allow for the private copying of electronic
works. This exception or limitation should apply to non-commercial use only. Distribution to
the public or public communication should not be covered by this exception. National
legislation may further restrict the distribution or communication of private copies (for
example by restricting private copies to personal use by the owner of the original copy, for as
long as ownership of the original copy is retained). In addition, national legislation may
provide for a general exemption in relation to certain types of works or certain forms of
exploitation captured by the private copying exception.

7) It is proposed to have a separate question addressing the specific issue of levies for
exceptions or limitations to copyright protection.”

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

AIPPI is considering to study the question of exceptions and limitations for archives and
libraries in detail at the Congress in Rio in 2015.


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
AIPPI has passed Resolution Q216 (see above I. for the process of passing Resolutions within
AIPPI) in Paris 2010, which also mentions format shifting under considerations for the more
general Resolution:
“Format shifting involves converting material into another, often digital format. The national
jurisdictions currently offer varying limitations or exceptions to copyright protection in order
to allow for legally permissible format shifting, e.g. for private use or for non-commercial
institutions such as libraries, museums, etc. However, few jurisdictions allow format shifting
for commercial purposes.”
The Resolution Q216B may be downloaded here:
https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/216/RS216English.pdf
One of the principal issues in connection with preservation and archiving is that of its effect
on commercial exploitation if access is not restricted.

elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements

                                                                                             27

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,

                                                                                          28
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

teaching, including across borders?

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

AIPPI, at Paris 2010, has adopted a Resolution (see for its process above I.) as follows:
“Subject to laws that may govern access to works by the visually impaired or by any other
disabled person format shifting should be available for commercial business models by way
of licence only. For private and non-commercialuses, limitations or exceptions to copyright
protection may be provided in cases where the limitation or exception in question meets the

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not


51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              34

to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

54.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There seems to be ample consensus that, generally, text and data mining activities should be
encouraged as necessary tools of progress of a digital economy. However, such activities are
still developing and far from reaching a mature state. Accordingly, it would be advisable to
foster market-based solutions between participants. Legislative activities should be kept to the
minimum at this initial stage.
Text and data mining of non-copyrighted materials (eg, raw data) should not be restricted or
limited in any way. Abusive behaviors could give rise to actions under the data base sui
generis right (Directive 96/9/EC).


52
  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .


                                                                                                     35
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
Text and data mining of copyrighted materials may trigger copyright infringements
depending on how the current provisions (rights of reproduction and transformation and
exceptions) are applied and interpreted by courts in the specific circumstances. Given that
such rights and exceptions were not created with text and data mining activities in mind, it
may be premature and speculative to draw general conclusions. In addition, there seems to be
limited consistency across text and data mining processes, content access methods and
protocols. Technical efforts to establish standards and achieve larger interoperability of
formats, processes, etc. should continue with the contribution of the EU Commission.
Probably copyright and neighboring rights should not be at the center of the debate on text
and data mining: access to content should be the key at this stage. At a later stage, once the
benefits of data and text mining have better crystalized in society, there should be clearer
context to tackle more fundamental legal issues such as whether data and information (not
protected by intellectual property) may be the subject matter of property rights, or instead
should be the realm of liability systems.
Copyright initiatives should encourage right holders to allow text and data mining activities
provided that such activities do not conflict with a normal exploitation of works and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of authors. A good example in this regard is
the commitment by certain scientific publishers to create a mining portal (see point 10. of the
document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”). This initiative
would be even more interesting should the publishers be able to offer a special “mining”
subscription allowing researchers that are not regular subscribers to have limited access to
contents for mining purposes.
However, in order to accelerate the availability of text and data for mining, an exception for
non-commercial research should be seriously considered.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
For the time being, legislative actions should be limited to the consideration of an exception
for non-commercial research.
56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Foster standardization and licensing schemes.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
Yes. Allegations that text and data are trade secrets, and therefore not accessible, are not
uncommon. It is questionable whether such contents are truly trade secrets or whether such
characterization is a way to refuse access or re-use of contents not protected by intellectual
property rights.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and


                                                                                                 36
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As this is an area of relatively recent appearance and on-going development, it appears
advisable to allow more time for its analysis. One of the first steps of the analysis would be to
try to define the concept of UGC. Towards this aim, different categories of UGC could be
distinguished:
(i) Neutral UGC: the contents do not include any pre-existing third party work or protected
subject-matter. In turn, two sub-types may be distinguished: (a) non-copyrighted UGC (raw
UGC): none of the contents of the UGC merit copyright protection. This sub-category would
include subject-matter originating from third parties that does not merit copyright protection,
such as raw data or pure information; (b) copyrighted UGC (pure UGC): all or part of the
content generated by the user includes (exclusively) the user’s own intellectual creation.



                                                                                              38
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
Such neutral UGC (including both its raw and pure subclasses) should not generate any
conflict with third party rights and, as such, should not be subject to any restriction or
regulation. In fact, the creation of neutral UGC should be encouraged, for example by
facilitating licensing schemes that use automatic identification systems in the case of pure
UGC so that user-creators can license and assert their rights in a practical / realistic way.
(ii) Hybrid UGC: the contents generated by the user do include some sort of third party
copyrighted content. Two sub-types may be distinguished: (a) Hybrid- infringing UGC: cases
of clear cut infringement with minimal or no contribution by the user; in fact it could be
questioned whether this type of output should be considered as UGC at all (since the user
does not generate anything), and (b) Hybrid- derivative USG: where the user takes third party
content to combine it with his/her own contribution. This last sub-category is the one that
raises more difficult questions.
Whilst the hybrid- infringing UGC should obviously be discouraged, the hybrid- derivative
UGC merits the attention of legislators and judiciary to try to find a balance between the
legitimate interests of creators and users.
A first step should be towards fostering sector licensing schemes between right holders and
platforms (ie, UGC providers, see below). Some initiatives are already under way, e.g. in the
recording industry where compensation to right-holders come from platforms (and not users)
via advertising revenues. Statutory exceptions for UGC in the EU should probably await to
analyse the practical experience of other jurisdictions that have established them, such as
Canada. Also, the openly formulated “free use” provisions of German law (Art. 23 and 24
German Copyright Act) should be worth a look. Case law under these German provisions
draws the borderline between illegal adaptation and a free use asking, if the older work used
“fades away” in the new work.
Since very recently, the Canadian legislation provides a separate user right pertaining to
transformative use of non-commercial, user-generated content. In contrast to the limitation
with respect to fair dealing (which need not be commercial) the statutory demarcation of
“non-commercial” will no doubt gain judicial attention in view of the increasingly murky line
between commercial and non-commercial use on the internet. Distribution of content free of
charge, while ads are served, raises the question as to what is meant by non-commercial.


59.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
In 2011, AIPPI discussed liability of UGC platform providers at length. Question “Q216B”

VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
At the AIPPI Executive Committee Meeting in Hyderabad, India, in October 2011, a
resolution was passed by AIPPI (see for the discussions process within AIPPI above I.),
which came to the following conclusion under 2):
“Rules concerning the liability of UGC providers have to strike a fair balance between
protecting the desired function of UGC providers to easily communicate users’ creations to
the public and safeguarding the rights holders’ interests to exclusively authorize and control
use of their copyright works. National and international law should provide for the following
principles:
a)     In general, there should be no obligation on UGC providers to monitor for infringing
       activity, except as set out below.
b)     UGC providers storing third party content should at least have a fair and reasonable
       duty to remove (take down) and prevent further uploading (stay down) of the same
       infringing content by the same infringer in situations where such UGC providers are
       furnished by the relevant rights holder with prima facie evidence of the specific
       infringement. A quick and simple dispute resolution procedure should be available,
       enabling the user to argue the legality of the content. If the UGC provider does not
       fulfill its duty to take down and take reasonable measures to ensure stay down of the
       specific content, the UGC provider may be liable for copyright infringement as if it
       was the underlying infringer.
c)     A UGC provider wilfully facilitating, enabling, cooperating with or contributing to
       infringing activity should be held accountable for the underlying infringement as if the
       UGC provider was the underlying infringer. The same principle should apply if the
       UGC provider makes the users’ infringing content its own content.”

https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/216B/RS216BEnglish.pdf


60.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Foster licensing schemes for “desirable” UGC, ie, hybrid- derivative UGC as described
above. Self-Regulation of the market should be fostered.
There will be cases where it is more likely that license agreements will be concluded via the
provider of the respective platform and others where micro licensing directly to the user
should apply.
-      The first solution (license via the platform provider) lends itself to all types of content
       where a (private) user is acting on a non-commercial basis and would thus be hesitant
       to continue using a platform where – even by micro licensing systems – payments have
       to be made by him or her. It has to be borne in mind that while the activity of the
       private users generating such content might by non-commercial, the activities of those
       running the platforms on which such content is offered are clearly of a commercial
       and highly profitable nature.
-      The second solution (micro licensing directly to users) might by appropriate for all
       those choosing to open “channels” of their own or crossing the borderline between
       strictly private and “not for profit”(yet commercial) use.



                                                                                               40
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
From our perspective, there is no way around dealing with these issues by contract. In
particular, it must be possible for a right holder to determine not only which works or other
protected matter is to be excluded from any use but also the amount of license due for various
stages of success a user generated content might undergo. Obviously, it lies in the right
holder’s interest to participate to a higher degree, the more intensely a content is used.
AIPPI would like to emphasise the need to respect that generally and within the limits of
general law, any right to license comprises the right to refuse such license at the right
holder´s discretion.



     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

61.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

72.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain

73.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
At the AIPPI Congress 2010 in Paris, Resolution Q216 (see above I. for the process of
resolutions) was adopted, which stated the following with regard to enforcement of rights in
the digital world:
“1) Effective and enforceable copyright protection should be safeguarded in the digital
environment.
2) The rights holder should be fully recognised under national laws as being exclusively
entitled to authorise and control the various activities of production, reproduction,

of intellectual property rights.

66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           45

communication, performance and other uses in respect of copyright works in communication
networks such as the Internet. Copyright law should therefore provide for an efficient
enforcement against infringing activities in such communication networks. These infringing
activities should in general not be rendered exempt from liability by way of compulsory
licences, mandatory levies or expansive limitations/ exceptions to copyright protection. For
the purposes of this paragraph uses in “communication networks” does not include uses in
broadcasting.
3) … (statement referring to limitations and exceptions, see above questions 21 et seq.)
4) For efficient and effective enforcement of copyright in the context of the Internet, the rights
holder should be entitled to address all parties that enable, facilitate or contribute to any acts
of copyright infringement, including a regime for ISPs to provide the information necessary
for such enforcement with due regard to user’s rights. Such parties should include not only
those users who are engaged in acts of direct infringement, but in general also ISPs according
to the principles set out below.
5) As ISPs or the Internet traffic they administer often operate on an international level,
national rules pertaining to ISP liability should be harmonised. It is preferable that national
and international law provide for guiding principles on the matter, including the following:
a) In general, there should be no obligation on ISPs to monitor for infringing activity, except
as set out below.
b) Host providers storing third party content should in general have a fair and reasonable duty
to remove and prevent further uploading of specific infringing content, where such host
providers are furnished by the relevant rights holder with prima facie evidence of an
infringement.
c) Access providers should in general have a fair and reasonable duty to block access to
copyright infringing material, where such access providers are furnished by the relevant rights
holder with prima facie evidence of infringement.”

AIPPI thinks EU law is line with these statements, in particular with regard to injunction
claims pursuant Art. 8 (3) Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.


Furthermore, AIPPI would like to draw the Commission’s attention to AIPPI’s Resolution
Q216B, passed at the AIPPI Executive Committee Meeting in Hyderabad, India, in October
2011 (see for the discussion process within AIPPI above I.), which came to the following
conclusion under 2) (This Resolution Q216B is already mentioned above answering question
59):
“Rules concerning the liability of UGC providers have to strike a fair balance between
protecting the desired function of UGC providers to easily communicate users’ creations to
the public and safeguarding the rights holders’ interests to exclusively authorize and control
use of their copyright works. National and international law should provide for the following
principles:
a)     In general, there should be no obligation on UGC providers to monitor for infringing
       activity, except as set out below.



                                                                                               46
VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
b)        UGC providers storing third party content should at least have a fair and reasonable
          duty to remove (take down) and prevent further uploading (stay down) of the same
          infringing content by the same infringer in situations where such UGC providers are
          furnished by the relevant rights holder with prima facie evidence of the specific
          infringement. A quick and simple dispute resolution procedure should be available,
          enabling the user to argue the legality of the content. If the UGC provider does not
          fulfill its duty to take down and take reasonable measures to ensure stay down of the
          specific content, the UGC provider may be liable for copyright infringement as if it
          was the underlying infringer.
c)        A UGC provider wilfully facilitating, enabling, cooperating with or contributing to
          infringing activity should be held accountable for the underlying infringement as if the
          UGC provider was the underlying infringer. The same principle should apply if the
          UGC provider makes the users’ infringing content its own content.”
This resolution may be downloaded here:
https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/216B/RS216BEnglish.pdf
We think that EU Law (Art. 8 (3) Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC and the provisions for
damage claims in the Enforcement Directive 2004/48) is in line with these statements for
liability of UGC providers.


What measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
Usually, the first step would be to make intermediaries aware that they are indirectly causing
or contributing to a third party copyright infringement. Most intermediaries (but not all) have
no interest in connecting themselves to illegal activity.
Furthermore, the realistic expectation of successful legal action against intermediaries will
likely raise their willingness to cooperate. This also seems to be relevant in an anti-trust
assessment of horizontal cooperation between intermediaries, as avoiding legal uncertainty
should be recognized as an efficiency gain under Art. 101 TFEU. Therefore, it is
indispensable that the EU legal framework provides for efficient remedies (injunction, but
also including damage claims) against intermediaries.

74.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
X YES – Please explain
AIPPI thinks that it is the courts' task to achieve this right balance. So far, in particular the
case law of the CJEU raises no doubts that the courts are determined and able to fulfil this
task (see CJEU C-275/06 – note 68 – Promusicae; C-360/10 notes 46 et seq. –
SABAM/Netlog; C-70/10 notes 44 et seq. – Scarlet/SABAM).

VERSCHM P 2190275 / 1
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

75.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES

term project?
