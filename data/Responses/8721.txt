Introduction
Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a few requests annually for granting multi-territorial licences for reprint of single article in Poland  -  number of such requests is depended on the position of newspaper or magazine in the polish market. Such requests refer only to a few of the most opinion-forming press titles. The press has the specific nature, for that reason most of the licenses are granted to individual consumers in the national market. Licensing mechanisms relating to e-subscriptions do not contain any territorial limitations, consumers can therefore have free access to the subscriptions they order or digital press from all over the world. Thus, the need for pan-european licences for the press is not relevant at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press is typically connected with a national territory, the majority of business licenses related to reproduction and press clippings are also national licenses. Territory is always specified in licenses for publications in the area of printed press. In digital world territorial limitations for licensing digital editions and press clippings are rarely. The scope of a license is generally defined by a number of end customers authorised to have the service.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using foreign press is marginal in Poland since the press primarily covers regional topics and the language is local; the press is generally disseminated in national languages. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important to stress that press publishers should always be able to decide what will be the subject or subjects of the license. The presumptive pan-European license should always be based on voluntary choice and never imposed. Press is primarily a national product and the cultural issues are mostly regulated on national level. Territorial character of copyright is not the problem in press sector. There are far more serious barriers and obstacles in multi-territorial licensing like unclear antitrust laws, differences between tax systems (different VAT rates and withholding tax) and dominance of pirate press clippings services which results in unfair competence with legal service providers. Therefore, European Commission should first fight against infringements and prevent unfair practices like the abuse of dominant position by service providers gaining profits from press circulation.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From a practical point of view the scope of the making available right is sufficiently clear 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

 NO

 NO OPINION
Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hyperlink which lead to a work protected under copyright is not a kind of footnote. It gives access to the content and makes it possible to be available to the public. In our opinion if provision of a hyperlink communicates a protected work to the public it should require an authorisation of the rightholder. If provision of a hyperlink leads to illegal content it should constitutes the copyright infringement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In press sector first lines of a news article are the most important. They draw the reader's attention and grasp the essence of the story which is then extend in successive paragraphs. When links to newspaper content are provided together with the first lines of the article, there is a great risk that readers look at that lines and loose motivation to continue reading relevant information on the newspaper websites as such. It is a redirecting of traffic which has very negative impact on advertising revenues which rely on the number of clicks recorded on the newspaper website. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using newspaper content in services like Google News should therefore be considered as the copyright infringement. Using links to newspaper content without prior consent of the publisher should not be possible unless it is truly indispensable for navigation in horizontal search.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Infopaq Case, The Court of Justice of the European Union clarify that acts of reproduction could be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC only when they fulfil all the requirements set in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC, in particular when the activity have no independent economic significance and its sole purpose is to enable a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary or a lawful use of a work or other subject matter to be made. If the service fails to fulfil one of these conditions, than the given reproduction activity is not exempted on the basis of Directive 2001/29/EC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, when the reproduction comes from an obviously illegal platform, the temporary reproduction exception is not applicable and using of the press content is a copyright infringement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain by giving examples

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The concept of providing a legal framework for resealing of previously purchased digital content would raise a lot of problems. The right of exhaustion means a physical transfer of ownership of the work. In digital world it is very easy to make copies. Mailing a file with a work means that it is automated copied  -  without the introduction of effective digital rights management preventing copying  -  the concept of the digital right exhaustion would in fact legalise piracy. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taking into consideration the present status of technology and the ineffective protection of publishers content in the we strongly oppose the adoption of the principle of the right exhaustion in relation to digital copies.
Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to current international legislation concerning copyright, the registration could only be voluntarily and cannot be a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our opinion, registration system at EU level would only create an unnecessary administration burden. This concept is contrary to the Berne Convention and would lead to false assumptions that only registered works are protected by copyright. Registering of articles would not facilitate licensing but would only signify higher costs for publishers.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collective management of rights depends on identification systems and databases. The European Commission should support the projects aimed at improvement of the Internet-based solutions in the area of providing authorised access to content and using text and image works.
Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

 YES

In our opinion the current terms of protection is even more appropriate in the digital world and shortening the terms of copyright protection could have negative consequences for the development of culture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright are mostly treated by purchasers as investments and therefore shortening the terms of copyright protection would lead to decrease of the value of the creativity and in result remuneration for the transfer of copyright would also be lowered. In further perspective, it could cause the degeneration of culture due to the lack of authors' motivation to create new works

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are strongly against any additional exceptions. The list of exceptions in Directive 2001/29/EC is very long and it gives enough flexibility. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any possible new exception cannot be introduced without a thorough analysis of the impact on creating and financing the culture. We should pose the question who is a beneficiary of such exceptions in the economic sense. Consumers or online platforms?. The latter earns huge amounts of money on the consumer's activities, which  -  on the basis of an exception  -  place on these platforms also copyright protected materials of the third parties. New exceptions can lead in a longer perspective to a disappearance of the professional creation which be replaced by the user generated content.

The optional character of exceptions and limitations in the Directive 2001/29/EC already provides sufficient degree of flexibility.

* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

In Poland press publishers have a big problem with the abuse of that exception. It is strictly connected with an inappropriate implementation of Directive 2001/29/EC in Poland. The archive status is used by private media monitoring companies, which copy the content of all publically available content online and scan and digitalise the content of all newspapers and magazines published in Poland. Then, they make the publisher's content available to the public while providing commercial press clipping services. This exception should be applied in a minimal scale.

Firstly, European Commission should thoroughly check if the rules of Directive 2001/29/EC are respected in all EU countries.
Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We need to solve the problem of creating non-commercial tools (like search engines) which will make possible to distinguish commercial or non-commercial use. The most profitable business in the Internet is not providing access to the copyright protected work but delivering the tools to find or present it.
E  -  lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

In regard to current issues of publishers content and the archives of press material made available online, the change of the current scope of that exception would mean the introduction of a mechanism of unfair competition towards press publishers. An easy way to see newspapers and magazines made available online by the publishers in a commercial manner via the library website, will entirely ruin digital press market in Poland. The possibility of introducing paid licenses should be thoroughly analysed. The permanent access to press content via a website is totally different than a temporary use of the work's copy borrowed from a library. It is sufficient to record one digital file with the newspaper content, put it on a library server and provide link to the content for everybody to see. Who will, however in that case, finance the creation of such a newspaper? 
Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2011 MoU referred mostly to books not to the press. The press sector operates in an entirely different way and newspapers provide access online to old content through their archives and databases on commercial basis. It is rather difficult and unpractical to speak of the "out of commerce" content in case of the press.

Mass digitalisation of publishers content by public libraries or by private companies like Google represents a considerable risk to publishers' ability to make contractual agreements by which they can monetise their content in the digital environment.

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We don't observe specific problems from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, when text and data mining access is provided for scientific research purposes via licensing models developed by the publishing industry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are, however, serious potential problems when text and data mining access is not managed via licensing models. Publishers should always retain the right to decide how their content may be used or re-used by others and when may not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, text and data mining access has to be a managed process in order to avoid disruption of different platforms used by press publishers. In this context, it is important that potential miners continue to keep in touch with press publishers to achieve the best result for their research. It is necessary to avoid any potential degradation to these platforms, which may happen when unmanaged mining takes place without publisher support.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lastly, from the perspective of press publishers, any potential exception for text and data mining could be abused by news aggregators and media monitoring companies in order to avoid acquiring the license for their activities

User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

No matter if creative works are amateur or professional, they are subject to the same copyright rules. This means that the every use of existing protected works needs to be authorised by the author or other rightholder, unless there is a place for an exception. Licences for Europe consultations show that licensing schemes are possible in the area of the use of user generated content, including micro-licences concluded between rightholders and consumers generating the content.

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a need to harmonize provisions on remuneration for private copying and reprography on the EU level.  The possibility of copying for private use should be accompanied by fair remuneration of copyright holders, suffering damages due to such copying. Common rules of calculating the level of levies and of listing devices and carriers covered by these levies should be introduced for all Member States of the EU. These levies should be collected at an early stage, as is the case at present in Poland, from manufacturers and importers of copying devices and blank carriers, by means of which copies of works can be made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The private copying levy system should be transferred into the digital environment. In digital era the consumers make private copies even more often than before on more connected devices and services. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a general rule, levies should be collected in the country where the end consumer reproduces the work, in the country where damage to the author is done. There are also no grounds to distinguish situation of purchasing reproducing devices based on the criterion of private and professional purposes. In practice, control whether such devices are actually used in accordance with the purpose declared is impossible, in particular in the case of further re-sale of the device. Hence, colleting of levies on all such appliances is necessary.

Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea to include levies on private copying into the licensing system originate from false and unrealistic assumption that new business models allow the authors to get remuneration directly from the owners of digital services. However, in practice only very limited group of rightholders has the possibility to sign agreement directly with Internet service providers. It is never the case of press publishers or journalists. The only form of fair remuneration for these groups of rightholders may be private copy or reprography levies. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The European Court of Justice decided also in the VG Wort case (C-457/11-C460/11) that a possible consent by the copyright holder to the reproducing of his work or other subject matter in the context of the exceptions provided for private copying and reprography in Directive 2001/29/EC has no effect on fair remuneration payable under the exception. This means that remuneration paid to the author or publisher under a license does not preclude from receiving the fair compensation for the exception.

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system of compensation levies should take into consideration changes of methods of using works in digital era. At present, more often than in the past reproduction of works for private use is done within online services of various type. Thus, common European provisions should be introduced to enable colleting levies for copying in new business models in digital world, including i.a. within the framework of services based on cloud technology.

What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In respect of reprography levies, the question is irrelevant, as noted also in the report from the mediator Antonio Vitorino. The reprography exception under Directive 2011/29/UE (Art. 5.2 a) covers reproductions on a specific medium (paper), using any kind of photographic technique, regardless of its purpose, which may be for professional, educational, private and other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, when it comes to analysing the impact of reprography levies, it is not relevant to make a distinction between private and professional uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a levy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?

Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For press publishers the fundamental basis is the respect for the freedom of contract and the freedom of negotiations. Any European initiatives which may have the goal to prohibit certain clauses in contract should take into accounts the distinction between different sectors. One solution which can be applicable for audiovisual or music content is not relevant for publishing since the contractual relationships and rights management are organised differently in each sector.

Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The civil enforcement system in the EU should not be limited to infringements committed with a commercial purpose. All infringements should be punished. The only difference between commercial or non-commercial infringements could be in sanctions, which should be larger for commercial purpose infringements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are strongly against any form of legislation that would decriminalise the non-commercial infringements. Infringements for non-commercial purpose usually create commercial profits to third parties (Internet Service Providers). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet Service Providers should face high requirements in the area of taking measures leading to preventing violations of copyrights in Internet. In particular, regulation should be created that would require them to immediately react to information about appearance of violations based on services rendered by them. When obtaining such information, they should be obliged to immediately block access to a given service and remove access to contents raising justified doubts as to the legality of their origin. They should be also charged in specific situations with the obligation to monitor contents made available from the point of view of their conformity with the provisions of intellectual property rights in force
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual property rights should always have priority over illegal exploitation of works or other subject matters. Arguments about the right to privacy, protection of personal data or the right to access to information often referred to in this context are sometimes only a cover to justify free access to free entertainment for users and this does not mean that somebody else is not making big money on illegal providing access to it. Therefore, there is no room for granting excessive protection to free access to intellectual property at the expense of rightholders.

A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
European Commission should rather focus on the adoption of an overall IPR strategy, than work on a single EU Copyright Title. The EU countries have different legal traditions and systems, which include both common law and civil law practises, and it is hard to believe that sufficient unanimity could be reached among EU Member States.

One of the challenges facing press publishers in the digital environment is how to ensure that Internet companies and other third parties do not extract the value of their content, without remuneration for those who created or invested in that content. Effective IPR enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to combat with piracy and parasitism, as well as to ensure that rights holders and the society can fully enjoy the benefits of the intellectual property.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that fair competition, respect of copyright and value of content, as well as equal search are indispensable conditions for the proper functioning of the digital ecosystem, to the benefit of all users and consumers. Today, technology platforms and search engines have a great impact on which press content is visible and accessible to users on the Internet. In this context, it is essential that search engines act in a neutral way to ensure that all press content can be found without any discrimination.
