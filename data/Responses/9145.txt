The Law Society of Scotland’s response


January 2014





Introduction
The Law Society of Scotland aims  to  lead  and  support  a  successful  and
respected Scottish legal profession.  Not only do we act in the interest  of
solicitor members but we also have a clear responsibility  to  work  in  the
public interest.  That is why we actively engage and seek to assist  in  the
legislative and public policy decision making processes.

To help us do this, we use our various Society committees which are made up
of solicitors and non-solicitors and ensure we benefit from knowledge and
expertise from both within and outwith the solicitor profession.

The Intellectual Property Law Sub-Committee  (the  Committee)  has  had  the
opportunity to  consider  the  Europeans  Commissions  consultation  on  the
review of the EU copyright rules and  has  the  following  comments  to  put
forward in response to the questions posed in the consultation document.

Comments

6   Are there reasons why, even in cases where you  have  acquired  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the  consumer  to  a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

Yes Distributed Networks – it might be necessary to redirect a  consumer  to
a local server due to server speed.

7 Do you  think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders

No.  The market should perhaps decide  the  balance  between  providing  the
freedom to offer EU-wide services and the obligation  to  do  so.  We  might
also consider the negative  correlation  between  cross-border  restrictions
and the scope/potential for infringement.

8 Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations  –
i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

No.  The wording in the Directive  might  be  amended  to  clarify  that  an
undertaking “makes a product available” in those territories  in  which  the
undertaking hopes/intends to trade – implementing a target approach.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or  other  subject
matter protected under  copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

No. In general  –  it  should  be  covered  by  the  exception  –  it  is  a
technological enabling process and the consumer cannot perceive the copy.

See further our answer to  Q  12.  Even  if  the  hyperlink  has  been  made
longwinded in order to claim that  it  has  more  creative  content  than  a
telephone number, the reproduction has no economic significance.

12.Should the viewing  of  a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright  on
the screen and in the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation  of
the rightholder

No.  As per Q11, the  temporary  copy  ought  to  be  considered  to  be  an
exception. Further, if the viewing of a web page DID require  authorisation,
this may hinder the efficacy of a network. See the unanimous views  of   the
UK Supreme  Court  in   Public  Relations  Consultants  Association  Limited
(Appellant)  v  The  Newspaper   Licensing   Agency   Limited   and   others
(Respondents   [2013] UKSC 18, before making a referral to  the  ECJ  .  See
especially Lord Sumption at paragraph 36.

14 What would be the consequences of providing a  legal  framework  enabling
the resale of previously  purchased  digital  content?  Please  specify  per
market (type of content) concerned.

The creation of a “second hand” market might reduce the value  of  copyright
content,  thus  potentially  devaluing  creativity  and  the  incentive   to
innovate. However, if the “forward and delete” issue can  be  overcome,  the
consequences of such a framework ought to be  limited:  copyright  protected
work ought not to be exempt from market forces, though where the value of  a
physical work might increase over time (eg First edition book, vinyl  record
in good condition) the digital copy is unlikely to do so

At present there is a lack of legal clarity about the extent  of  the  title
that is obtained by a purchaser of  digital  content  and  available  to  be
passed on upon resale. The conventional view is that  the  provider  may  by
stipulations restrict the title to, in effect, a limited right of  use  that
is non-transferable, in life or death. It is submitted  that  this  view  is
incompatible with the reasoning of the European Court  of  Justice  in  Case
128/11 UsedSoft GmbH v Oracle International Corp (supra). Reference is  made
in particular to paragraph 88 of the judgment: “Articles 4(2)  and  5(1)  of
Directive 2009/24 [on the legal protection of computer  programs]   must  be
interpreted as meaning that, in the event of the resale of  a  user  licence
entailing the resale of a copy of a computer  program  downloaded  from  the
copyright holder’s website, that licence having originally been  granted  by
that rightholder to the first acquirer for an  unlimited  period  in  return
for payment of a  fee  intended  to  enable  the  rightholder  to  obtain  a
remuneration corresponding to the economic value of that copy of  his  work,
the second acquirer of the licence, as well as any  subsequent  acquirer  of
it, will be able to rely on the exhaustion of the distribution  right  under
Article 4(2) of that directive, and hence be regarded  as  lawful  acquirers
of a copy of a computer program within the meaning of Article 5(1)  of  that
directive and benefit from the right of reproduction provided  for  in  that
provision.”.

It is submitted that legislation (including  but  not  limited  to  consumer
legislation) can and  should  put  the  title  of  a  purchaser  of  digital
content on a par with that of a purchaser of goods. Such legislation  should
also require the reseller (absent explicit  licence  to  the  contrary)   to
delete from their own systems all copies of that  which  is  resold  and  to
contain an implied warranty of such deletion in the resale. It is  submitted
that the task of devising a technical and proportionate method  of  ensuring
that such deletion does occur can and should be left  to  the  ingenuity  of
the industry.    It is observed that there is nothing  new  in  combining  a
sale of goods with a licence limitation on use.  The purchase of  a  Compact
Disc expects to be licensed only for domestic use.

15 Would the creation of a registration system  at  EU  level  help  in  the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

No.

16 What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

Similar advantages  to  those  of  registered  trade  marks  and  registered
designs. Principally, it provides the rightholder with  comfort  and  access
to efficient resolutions to infringement.

17 What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

The database of registered works would presumably have a watermark  feature.
The concept of such a database might act as  a  commercial  disincentive  to
licence providers (eg Getty Images) as it may undermine the  database  costs
which have been incurred. It might also cause duplication of  search  engine
results, which ought also to provide  access  to  watermarked  content.  The
registration would also only show when the work  was  created,  rather  than
demonstrate that the work has been infringed.

18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

These ought to reflect the advantages which stakeholders identify in Q16.

19.  What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the   adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

An “identifier taxonomy” system might be developed, similar to the  Nice  or
Hague Agreements.

20 Are the current terms of copyright protection still  appropriate  in  the
digital environment?

No.  The prevalence of audio-visual work is such that it ought to  be  given
the same level of protection as  other  forms  of  copyright.  Technological
advances mean that a/v is being used in  cases  where,  in  the  past,  LDMA
works might have been used.

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

Yes.  There is reduced legal certainty in allowing optional exceptions.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

All exceptions should first  be  harmonised  and  then  made  mandatory.  To
reverse this process might cause additional practical challenges.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions.

If Art.5(1) were to be made  non  exhaustive,  this  would  provide  greater
flexibility (though perhaps a non-material  reduction  in  legal  certainty)
and  could,  to  a  degree,  future-proof  the  legislation  to  accommodate
developments in technology.

25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by  the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its  possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.

As above, amend the wording of Art.5(1) and permit the  courts  to  identify
and determine those instances where expansion is desirable.

27 In the event that limitations  and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of  “fair
compensation”  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part   of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?

The Committee would be interested to learn of  the  proposals  but  at  this
stage, would comment that  uniformity  of  implementation  is  desirable  in
order to preserve legal certainty.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
application of the private copying  and  reprography  exceptions[1]  in  the
digital environment.

No. (Clarity is perhaps  only  required  on  the  definition  and  scope  of
private copying/private purposes if levies are to apply to  private  copying
– Q65.  It might be  useful  to  provide  additional  clarification  on  the
circumstances under which levies may be claimed.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application  to   online
services (e.g. services based on cloud computing   allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new  business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
revenue on the other.

Online services  provide  additional  flexibility  for  end  users.  If  the
rightholder  can  obtain  fair  revenue  once  through  legitimate   (albeit
flexible)  frameworks,   this   is   perhaps   preferable   to   encouraging
infringement, in the event that users are charged per device.

67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?

Increased visibility could make all levels of the  distribution  chain  more
mindful of rightholders’ interests.

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

No. These issues are perhaps best determined by the market.

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose

No. This is probably a quantification of damages issue, where damages  ought
to reflect the commercial use which has been made of the work.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
for  sufficient involvement of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries.

Intermediaries are, for the most part, mindful of the dangers  of  copyright
infringement. Their  cooperation  will  always  be  tempered  by  their  own
commercial interests. The current framework  arguably  goes  as  far  as  is
appropriate without burdening  intermediaries  with  the  task  of  actively
protecting rightholders.

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project.

If certain commitments are made and changes effected,  arising  from  Q1  to
Q77, arguably, the merit of creating  an  EU  Copyright  Title  is  reduced.
However, the principle of harmonisation is desirable.

The process of a  single  title  ought  to  be  a  long  term  project.  The
potential  for  legislative  contradictions  arising  and   the   commercial
consequences of such contradictions are such that any pursuit  of  a  single
title should not be hurried.

A single title must also consider the issue raised at Q7, namely  it  should
provide a  balance  between  the  freedom  to  offer  EU-wide  products  and
services and the obligation to do so.  With  a  single  title,  it  must  be
considered whether products would automatically be “made available”  in  all
Member States and the consequences or desirability of that.

If rightholders  are  granted  increased,  rather  than  harmonised  rights,
across Europe, this might have the effect  of  stifling  creativity,  either
through increased concern of copyright infringement, or otherwise.

In order to  effectively  manage  a  single  title  framework,  a  copyright
registration  system  might  be  required.   Concerns   arising   from   the
desirability of such a registration system should  therefore  be  considered
contemporaneously with the single title question.
