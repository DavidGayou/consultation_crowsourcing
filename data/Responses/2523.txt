             CONSULTATION ON THE REVIEW OF THE
                   EU COPYRIGHT RULES

1.         PRELIMINARY REMARKS

EuroISPA is the pan European association of European Internet Services Providers
Associations (ISPAs). We are recognized as the voice of the EU ISP industry and are the
largest umbrella association of Internet Service Providers in the world. EuroISPA regularly
participates in the Commission’s public consultations among others on matters related to
intellectual property rights.1

2          RESPONSES TO THE CONSULTATION QUESTIONS

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
    Europe?
2. Have you faced problems when seeking to provide online services across borders in
the EU?

Despite the fact that there are no legislative obstacles preventing or prohibiting the provision of
cross-border digital services and the development of a unique continental market for online
content, there’s still a country-by-country commercial repartition. This artificial fragmentation is
the result of commercial practices actually put in place by rightholders, as described below:

a)       Licensing of content by right holders (major studios, independent producers, and
broadcasters) is, in fact, still managed at national level based on the concept of the territorial
exclusivity. This means that in acquiring the content in a given country, for instance, a video on
demand (VOD) operator can only make the content available in that given country and has to
put in place DRM measures (geo-filtering of IP addresses) to prevent EU citizens living in
different countries from acquiring that content. A provider willing to supply a cross-national EU
VOD service, thus exploiting the low distribution costs entailed by digital distribution, would then
need – for each content item in the library - to negotiate and sign a specific contract in each
specific territory. This has very much to do with the fact that online rights are still managed in

many cases in bundle with other forms of distribution (broadcasting for instance) for which the
territorial dimension still makes more sense that the European one.

b)       The territory-by-territory acquisition of rights does not entail simply having different
libraries for each territory, but also different economic conditions, retail prices, availability dates,
usage limitations, as again the condition at which the right is negotiated depends by the local
branch dealing with it. This creates additional issue for to the establishment of a pan European
digital service, as it would be extremely difficult for a digital operator, and confusing vis-à-vis the
customers, justify why the same title is offered only in some countries and not in others, at very
different dates, pricing and release conditions

Remarkably, the European Commission (DG COMP) has recently (13 January 2014) opened an
investigation covering such commercial practices with the aim to find out whether they reflect
anti-competitive behaviours.

c)       Beside the above issues, the impact of the collective right management system on the
digital single market is also relevant, creating additional complexities. In practice, even when
rights are acquired by on-line platform operators for each country, a further territory-by-territory
clearance has to be gained through the national based Collective Management Organizations
(CMOs). The relevance in this context of the restrictive behaviour of collecting societies was
confirmed by the European Commission in the antitrust decision of 2008.

As a result, under the current system, most digital content that could easily be distributed
through an online platform for the entire continent’s consumption may then be subject to several
deals and to clearance 28 times through at least 28 different CMOs, not taking into account
mayor and a large number of independent labels. All such deals involve significant transaction
costs and potential restrictions dramatically hampering the roll-out start-ups and of cross-border
services. This frustrates and brakes innovative and competitive players which, in the absence of
the above obstacles, could easily develop online content offers with continental reach, thanks to
the capability of the Internet protocol and the wide presence of broadband and high-speed
connections.

To sum up, the fragmentation of digital distribution across Europe is, rather than the result of
(fragmented) legal framework, the scope of commercial and contractual practice of rights-
holders which has led to a rigid segmentation of the market in order to maximise profits on a
country by country basis, to the detriment of consumers and the single market. The above
scenario seriously frustrates the emergence of EU-wide offers (as well as national ones), unlike
the US, where there is a huge development of premium content VOD platforms. The material
advantage of the US market with respect to the EU is that in the US VOD/online rights are
distributed in a one-stop shop approach for the whole territory and in a non-exclusive way,
which has allowed several players competing on quality of service and business models to
emerge. We believe the artificial fragmentation in Europe plays the major role in the different
level of development of VOD and digital content services in Europe compared to the US, while
other elements (such as national fragmentation, linguistic differences, lack of harmonization)
play a minor role and are frequently overestimated.

As the result of the above, various undertakings, which are members of EuroISPA’s national
associations have encountered problems with or even abandoned the launch of pan-European
digital services.

7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of
content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for
right holders?

YES – A comprehensive review of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright in the Information Society
would be needed along with clear measures specifically aimed at ending the current restrictive
licensing practices. The recent decision of the ECJ Nintendo vs.PC Box2 suggests that it is time
to reconsider whether the copyright framework in force still fits the new digital and technological
environment. See question 21 below.


B.     Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

The act of “making available”

8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

NO - In general, the distinction between communication and reproduction rights when
distributing rights over the Internet should be deeply revised. Such distinction is the result of
customary commercial practices applied in the traditional pre-Internet era and the simple
transposition into the digital world is questionable. In addition, such a distinction creates
complexities and uncertainties for undertakings and people willing to license rights for digital
content with the result that businesses and creativity are hindered, while piracy may be
somehow even encouraged. The EU should therefore start to analyse whether a unique ad-hoc
communication right should be created for the exploitation of content through digital networks.
This said, we note that the territorial scope of the “making available” right may have the effect of
legally sealing the current partition between national territories within the EU for copyright
purposes. Also for this reason, the EU should have the ambition of harmonizing copyright law
and thus creating a single EU territory for copyright purposes.

10.     Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

YES (see the answer above to question 8) – Measures aimed at making less burdensome the
licensing process would be beneficial, including the legal “bundling of rights” provided that it
does not create anti-competitive incentives for the licensing body, which must always seek the
objective of maximum distribution along with efficient revenues.


Linking and browsing

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject
to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO - A Hyperlink is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow to find an already
available content. Their function is to link any information to any other information over the
Internet; they are therefore integral to the creation and functioning of the World Wide Web.
Technically speaking, a link is not a transmission or communication of the work but a reference

    Decision of January 23, 2014 (case C-335/12).

to an already available work. Fact is, sharing hyperlinks on the internet is one of the most
common activities. Requiring the authorisation of a rightholder before sharing a hyperlink would
not only be cumbersome but would also undermine the fundamental right of free speech.

We note the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Svensoon
case (case C-466/12 Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB) whereby hyperlinking
has been considered as an act of communication to the public pursuant to the Copyright
Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC). However, the court has specified that, in the concrete
circumstances of the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely available on
another website, copyright protection does not apply and, therefore, authorization from the
rights-holder is not required.
EuroISPA welcomes favourably the decision taken by the court in the concrete circumstances of
the case, however disagrees on the principle, whether a simple hyperlink should be considered
as an act of communication pursuant to the Copyright Directive. The legal interpretation of the
European judges is clearly due to the current wording of the Copyright Directive, which was
conceived in an era when social networking and content sharing models were not imaginable.
Therefore, the European institutions should clearly intervene in order to adapt the notion of “act
of communication” to the needs of the digital economy as evolved until now.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

NO - Viewing of webpages is a widely accepted, general practice and part of the everyday life of
users all around the World. If merely viewing, without downloading or printing a website was
subject to copyright, many people are likely to infringe copyright while browsing the internet and
coming across websites containing copyright protected material.3

Although the normal use of the internet involves the creation of copies, this is the automatic
result of browsing the internet. The making of such copies in the cache is indispensable for
efficient web-browsing and therefore in line with Article 5 (1) of the Directive 2001/29/EC. The
copies retained on the screen or in the cache are merely the incidental consequence of the use
of a computer, and are temporary.

Furthermore, as suggested in the opinion of the UK Supreme Court “it has never been an
infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an infringing article
in physical form.”4

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

NO – The current terms are excessively long and are nowadays a crucial limitation to the
availability of content online. The term of 50 years after the death of the author prescribed by
the Berne convention of 1886 are not fit for the digital environment, which has the unlimited
potential of dissemination of cultural material. The 70 years after the death of the author term of
protection provided by the EU is hardly incentivizing the production of content and its
dissemination.

Shortening the term of protection at least until the minimum 50 years provided by the Berne
Convention would create a competitive advantage to EU enterprises creating and distributing
content as they would gain accessibility to 20 years of currently protected material.


Limitations and exceptions

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

YES - The starting point should be that from an EU law perspective, IPRs are obstacles to the
free movement of goods and services – which are scrutinised for their justification. The
difficulties in cross-border situations stem from the fact that IPRs are territorial and limitations
are optional and different from one MS to the next. But the most significant obstacle to the
internal market is the possible creation of new national IPRs - which should not be permitted
given the high level of harmonisation of rights.

EuroISPA believes that the currently European copyright legislation in force needs to be revised
in order to improve and harmonise rights as well as protection systems and adapt them to the
development of the Information Society. Some areas of traditional copyright rules risk to be
unable to keep peace with the changes in the way intellectual property circulates over
communications networks.

Furthermore, the exhaustive list of strictly defined exceptions lacks flexibility to adapt to the
changes occurring in a rapidly evolving environment for content, creation, access and
distribution.

In the interest of all stakeholders, it is essential to offer the broadest, reasonable and most
predictive scope to the exceptions in Article 5, under the condition that these be read within the
context of the three-step test described in Article 5.5.

The example about the private copy is self-explanatory. Member States are allowed to adopt
their own copyright limitations. Article 5.2.b of the Directive enables Member States to provide
for exceptions and limitations "in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural
person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial, on
condition that right-holders receive fair compensation which takes account of the application or
non-application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 to the work or subject-matter
concerned". However, only a few Member States have implemented article 5.2.b and the States
that made it, had regulated the exception in a heterogeneous way. The absence of clear
principles has also generated ambiguity in identifying the possible technologies that individuals
may use for the purposes of creating a private copy. As an example, in some Member State the
legislative framework seems to allow use of old technology of copy called “PVR3” (as DVD
recorder) that works off line while preventing the use of enhanced technologies as Network
PVR4.

The absence of clear principles of technological neutrality in the private copy exception currently
allows Member States to implement national rules that discriminate between recording
devices/technologies with same functionalities, only on the basis of their respective
technological features. This could prevent parties in the Single Market from pursuing in the
online environment practices, which would not be restricted in the offline environment. As a
result, business ventures dealing with digital content will require more time and money to
acquire all necessary permits. The above generates distortion in the market and prevents the
development of technological innovation.

22.     Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

YES - The number of exceptions presented in the list of Articles 5.2 to 5.5 of the 2001/29/CE
Directive should become made mandatory (instead of optional) anytime this is necessary to
protect and ensure fundamental citizens’ rights, effective availability of digital content as well as
proper cross-border circulation of the same.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]

Considering the large size and increasing number of user-generated content, failure to adopt
the copyright regime to the digital reality risks creating a situation where activities perceived as
normal by users are made illegal. This would undermine the credibility of copyright law among
average users and thus threaten broader right holder interest.

In order to clearly recognise the difference between the use of protected material as part of
user-generated new content and illegal file sharing of a work, it would be necessary to adapt the
copyright regime to include audiovisual content which incorporates users’ creative output,
creating this way a completely new work.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES – (See answer to question 21.) There are of course already open norms in the EU, such as
the three-steps-test, or proposals such as Article 5.5. of the ‘Wittem European Copyright Code’5,
or the Irish ‘Modernising Copyright’ proposal6. One way of addressing this issue is to encourage
member states to make use of existing flexibilities and provide open exceptions at national level.

Private copying

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

YES – In general, there is a need to rethink the entire private copy model as far as the fair
compensation mechanism provides for abuses, competition distortion and detriment for the
growth of broadband and digital services. One should therefore4 consider whether a fair
compensation mechanism is still needed.

Also, the idea that devices or connectivity is purchased for the purposes of making private
copies of professional content ignores the growth of User Generated Content (UGC).
In the EU-28, according to Eurostat, close to 23 million Europeans engaged in creating a
website or blog in 2012, including 14% of EU citizens aged between 16 and 24 years old. Over
83 million Europeans uploaded self-created content to a website, including 47% of 16 to 24 year
olds. 11% of Europeans posted opinions on civic or political issues via websites. WordPress
users produce about 36.3 million new posts and 63.1 million new comments each month, there
are more than 77,000 active contributors to Wikipedia working on more than 22,000,000 articles
in 285 languages. There are more than 41 000 posts a second on Facebook, 5 700 Tweets a
second on Twitter and 758 million photos a day were uploaded and shared online in 2013.

Today the overwhelming majority of content produced and shared on the internet, on digital
services and using connected devices does not belong to rightholder organisations. These
activities are clearly excluded from the scope of private copying levies. Yet the bluntness of
levies catches all this content.


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a
service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

NO - Licensed copies should not trigger the application of levies. According to Recital 35 of
Directive 2001/29/EC, “In cases where rightholders have already received payment in some
other form, for instance as part of a license fee, no specific or separate payment may be due.”
Making these digital copies subject to levies would create a situation of double payment and
would go against the view and expectations of the end users as service providers usually
acquire license from the right holder that covers all relevant acts in the given service, including
reproduction by the end user.

It should be kept in mind that the levy system was created in a situation where there was
reproduction of works that fell within the scope of the exclusive right but licensing was not
possible due to high transaction costs and the fact that the copying took place in private homes.
In digital realm it is possible to license even the smallest usages with a reasonable cost and
hence levies should not be brought to digital environment.


Further, consumers acquire originals under the assumption that they can make copies, and
rightholders know these copies will occur. The ability to make copies is priced into distribution to
the consumer7. Put simply, another way of looking at this is that consumers cannot reasonably
be expected to purchase separate originals for their home audio system, their car, their MP3
player and their computer. The exception for private copying is a legitimate expectation of
consumers - and as such not having an exception would bring the law into disrepute; but
requiring further payments for such acts is not. The acquisition of content or services licensed
by the rightholders implies already the usage of digital copies for private purposes. Therefore
such copies should not be a subject to private copying levies in order to avoid a situation of
double payment as the right to copy content several times is usually covered by the license fee
paid by the consumer.
There is no evidence of harm to rightholders in such cases, and these situations should be
considered de minimis. Mr. Vitorino came to the same conclusion8 in his report on copyright
levies where he rightly argued that applying a levy on a licensed service would pave the way for

  “Economic theory suggests that the benefits consumers derive from any copyright exceptions will be incorporated
automatically into the demand for the original creative work. Consumers will recognise that buying the original entitles
them to use the product in various ways and hence their demand decision will reflect this”: Mark Rogers, Joshua
Tomalin and Ray Corrigan, ‘The economic impact of consumer copyright exceptions: A literature review’ (2013), page
30; Ian Hagreaves, Digital Opportunity, ‘A Review of IP and Growth’, section 5.30: “As right holders are well aware of
consumers’ behaviour in this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able to do this is already factored into the
price that right holders are charging. A limited private copying exception which corresponds to the expectations of
buyers and sellers of copyright content, and is therefore already priced into the purchase, will by definition not entail a
loss for right holders”; Martin Kretschmer, ‘Private Copying and Fair Compensation’ (2011) page 68: “a certain amount
of copying can already be priced into the retail sale of the first copy if the consumer understands these benefits”;
H.A.Varian (2005), ‘Copying and Copyright’, Journal of Economic Perspectives 19(2): 121-138; p. 129; ‘Modernising
Copyright: The Report of the Copyright Review Committee’ (Dublin, 2013), page 60.

  As recognized in the 2013 recommendations of Antonio Vitorino on Copyright Levies “Usually, a service provider
acquires a license from the rightholder that covers all copyright relevant acts involved in the provision of the service,
including the reproduction of copyright protected content by the end user. Such licensing agreements also reflect the
view and the expectations of the end user. A person paying for e.g. the download of a song expects that this payment
does not only cover the first download of that song onto his or her personal computer but also the subsequent copying
of that song to a certain number of his or her mobile devices, as determined by the usage rules of the service provider.
Similarly, a person subscribing to a music streaming service is usually not only paying for the online streaming to his or
her device/s but also for the possibility to create "playlists" that can be listened to when "offline". […]”

multiple payments and be incomprehensible to consumers as it would be inconsistent users’
reasonable assumptions and basic expectations.


66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on
the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Private copying levies should not be applied to cloud services to the extent that copies that are
made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by
rights-holders do not cause any harm that would require additional remuneration in the form of
private copying levies.

A different approach would creatie uncertainty and competition distortion, since the entire
Internet and the main services (mail, social network, platforms) can be considered as a cloud.

It has already been noted that levies have adverse consequences on growth 9. Levies have
significant adverse impact on the development of the economy and the digital economy in
particular. Innovation and opportunity costs are by definition difficult to predict, but there is a
growing body of evidence correlating copyright and innovation policy10. Harvard professor Josh
Lerner recently evaluated that legal uncertainty on cloud services lead to a reduction in VC
investment in the cloud of $4.6m and $2.8m respectively per quarter in France and Germany
(see Josh Lerner, The Impact of Copyright Policy Changes in France and Germany on Venture
Capital Investment in Cloud Computing Companies, June 2012). In the UK, the government
estimates that reforming copyright, including a reform of private copying, will be “adding
between 0.3% and 0.6% to the size of the UK economy by 2020 – between £5 billion and £8
billion [€5.72 billion and €9.15 billion] – and cutting deadweight costs in the economy by over
£750 million [€858 million]” (Vince Cable, George Osborne and Jeremy Hunt, The Government
Response to the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth (London: HM
Government, 2011). In relation to levies, the UK IPO estimates that economic benefits to GBP
258.67 million11.


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?

YES - making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies, on the one hand
would create a trusted relationship with the user. On the other hand transparency of the system
would also contribute to the better remuneration of authors. We emphasise however that the
appropriate way of making the levies visible to the end users is through displaying it on the
invoice and not through marketing communication (advertising).

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

YES – Our Members’ experience is that, in cross-border sales, national collecting societies
charge copy levies twice: once in the country where a product is brought into circulation for the
first time in the EU (first wholesale purchase, the “country of origin”), and again when the item is

sold to an end-customer located in a different country (the “country of destination”). In practice,
this leads to double payment by the retailer: collecting societies and the CJEU refer to
reimbursement schemes and ask the retailer to seek a refund of levies paid in the country of
origin; however, a majority of Member States do not have reimbursement schemes in place.
Where they do exist, they are often not publicized or widely known, are difficult to access, and
ultimately put the burden of reporting sales and risk of loss on the requesting retailer. Very few,
if any, of the reimbursement schemes meet the standard of being “effective” and “not
excessively difficult”, as set forth by the ECJ in its judgment in Case C-521/11 Austro Mechana.

If, for example, an end customer purchases a blank DVD from an online retailer who physically
stores its stock in Germany and wants it delivered into Belgium, the German collecting society
will have charged a levy on the blank DVD when it was first brought into circulation in Germany
and the vendor will have passed this levy onto the retailer in its wholesale price. Subsequently,
the Belgian collecting society will charge the retailer a levy on that same blank DVD, since it is
being sold to an end customer in Belgium who, as presumed under national law, will likely use it
to make private copies of protected works. National collecting societies are therefore charging
copy levies on items both upon importation into their territory and – in case of cross-border
sales – upon retail sale within their territory. This results in undue double payments amounting
to millions of euros in hypothetical setoff rights that could be claimed from collecting societies
that unduly charge copy levies and that are required by the ECJ to offer a refund.

Beyond imposing heavy administrative burdens on cross-border traders for reporting and paying
the levies, this situation creates a complex and unpredictable environment for businesses, and
leads to a reluctance of traders to sell across internal EU borders because of the costs attached
to paying copyright levies, thereby hindering the pan-European online retail single market. This
situation induces manufacturers to avoid or minimize levy payments and, therefore, to withdraw
specific types of devices from a national market, or to downgrade the specifications of a device
(by adopting smaller inbuilt memories, for example) to the detriment of end-customers.
Consumers are penalised by a limited choice of products and technology. The system’s failure
to take into account the specificities of the online retail business model undermines cross-border
trade and the single market itself, in view of the fact that online retailers are those at the
forefront of driving cross-border offers.

The fact that levies may be charged both at the country of origin and at the country of
destination renders the exercise of an EU Fundamental Freedom less attractive, since cross-
border retailers are the only ones to actually suffer from double payment, and will only belatedly
be able to file claims for reimbursement at origin ex post, as and if reimbursement schemes
become widely available under national regulations. In any given period of time, therefore,
cross-border retailers will have to accept the burden of paying two identical levies on the same
products while waiting for a reimbursement to be processed at the country of origin.
Strictly national retailers, on the other hand, will have only paid once all along and will be at a
considerable competitive advantage, seeing as copy levies may be well over 15% of an item’s
retail price. This is precisely the definition of a measure having an effect equivalent to a
quantitative restriction on imports, strictly forbidden under Article 34 of the TFEU. We believe no
mandatory requirement (whether the protection or the promotion of culture, or the protection of
legitimate IP rights) could justify a system that results in paying the same levies twice and
doubling non-national retailers’ costs and risks in comparison to national retailers, since the
ultimate purpose of copy levies is to correctly remunerate copyright holders for acts of private
copying of their works by individuals – something that has no bearing whatsoever on the
shipment of a product from one Member State to another.

71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?




EuroISPA                                        -9-                             Copyright consultation
In our view, the only way to fully reconcile the existence of private copy levies with the
requirements of the Free Movement of Goods is to limit the number of Member States that can
lawfully charge levies on any single item to one, and ultimately disregard the fact that an item
has crossed internal EU borders as a factor that attracts subsequent copy levy payments. The
way to achieve this is by implementing a full, upfront exemption on copy levies for products that
are already in free circulation within the EU. This would result in levies being paid by
manufacturers or by importers upon placement of the goods in a Member State for the first time
in the EU, and retailers not paying any subsequent levies when selling to end customers cross-
border within the EU. In other words, products would only be subject to a levy in the source
country of origin, with collecting societies objectively determining how to best allocate resources
amongst themselves to address any issues arising from the differences in copy levy tariffs
between countries or the differing catalogues for which each society is legitimately entitled to
collect levies.


Enforcement of copyright

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

NO - EuroISPA considers that the current framework, the Directive 2004/48/EC on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRED) as it stands and the E-Commerce Directive,
Directive 2000/31/EC, offers a well-balanced and functioning framework to address in particular
online IPR infringements. The reason for this is that IPRED contains checks and balances for
enforcement that are not present in the Copyright Directive. It ensures that the protection of IPR
is balanced with fundamental freedoms and rights.12 The IPRED also provides for injunctions
against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR
infringement, and lays down the minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national
courts when formulating injunctive measures; while the E-Commerce Directive ensures that
such injunctions cannot result in general monitoring obligations.

If problems arise in the uniform respect of copyright, they stem from the late or uncompleted
implementation of the IPRED at national level and not from its legal provisions. However, should
there be in the future a need to address the enforcement of copyright, this should be done in the
context of the IPRED and not separately in the Information Society Directive, for the reasons
mentioned above.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

YES - Articles 9 and 11 of the IPRED already introduced injunctions against intermediaries
whose services are used by a third party for any proven IPR infringement, and lays down the
minimum legal conditions that must be adhered to by national courts when formulating injunctive
measures. These mechanisms proved to be efficient for rightholders in the enforcement of their
rights, especially with regards to commercial infringement, and are largely used across Europe.

At the same time article 12-15 of the E-Commerce Directive ensure that such injunctions are
proportionate and cannot result in general monitoring obligations. In the past years the Court of

Justice of the European has also explicitly dealt with the possible scope of injunctions against
internet intermediaries (e.g. C-324/09 - L’oreal./.eBay; C-70/10 - Scarlet Extended, C-
360/Sabam/Netlog) and made clear that such injunctions need to be very specific with regards
to the measures to be taken by intermediaries and must not merely be success oriented. For
example general filtering systems installed for the prevention of copyright infringements were
held disproportionate.

Multi-stakeholder cooperation should not be limited to ISP cooperating with rightholders to
defend the latter existing business models. Cooperation should also concern:
     Widespread availability of legal online content in affordable price
     Education of consumers

Furthermore, currently DG Markt of the Commission is working on an Action Plan addressing
IPR infringement. 13 The initiative recognises the wide range of intermediaries and aims at
exploring non-legislative initiatives, such as:

          Improve exchange of information and cooperation between relevant authorities in
           charge of enforcement of IPR in the Member States
          strengthen due diligence across the entire supply chains for products/services which
           depend heavily on intellectual property
          develop an MoU on advertising/ ‘Follow the money approach’

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as
the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

See answer to question 75.


Registry of rights holders

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

EuroISPA feels the need to point out the abuse of the notice and take down procedure.
Copyright holders are abusing their privilege to issue takedown notices to hosting providers by
providing poor quality notices, notices that fail to identify the infringing material, notices that
falsely claim material is infringing, notices relating to content for which they are not the rights
holder or even “robo-notices” (generated automatically by machine). ISPA would like to
emphasize that ISPs should not be burdened with the obligation of monitoring the content and
verifying its lawfulness. ISPA is convinced that the legitimacy of content should, especially in
regards to access providers, solely be verified by courts or judicial authorities.

The privilege of issuing takedown notices is also abused by using it against material which,
while incorporating some copyright protect content, uses it in a minimal fashion with no
economic harm to the rights holder, and in conformity with legitimate exceptions such as news
reporting, comment and study, parody, etc.

These abuses arise because rights holders do not have any incentive to be accurate, or even to
refrain from making malicious false claims. Indeed they are able to circumvent exceptions to
copyright protection provided for by law by alleging infringement when an exception clearly
applies, without any fear of recourse.

We therefore propose the creation of a “Registry of rights holders” to regulate this activity and
restrain abuse. The registry would ensure that:
         a) The privilege of issuing take-down notices direct to a hosting provider is limited to
         registered parties.

           b) Non-registered parties will continue to be able to vindicate their rights before a court,
           and will not impact on the court competence in instructing a hosting provider to remove
           infringing content.

           c) Hosting providers would cease to be liable for infringing content even after they have
           actual knowledge of the material, unless they have received a valid takedown order
           from a court, or a notice from a registered rightsholder, where the notice complies with
           minimal formal requirements.

           d) The registration body should be a public authority, and it should have a duty to
           establish a code of conduct for rightsholders issuing takedown notices. It should be
           required to consult publicly before making the code of conduct. It should be responsible
           for hearing complaints about breaches of the code of conduct, and have the power to
           suspend registered parties. Registered parties, while suspended, should no longer have
           the privilege of issuing takedown notices direct to hosting providers (suspended
           rightsholders could still go to court) until their suspension is lifted.

           e) All copyright holders, including individuals, would be entitled to apply for registration.
           However, reasonable conditions on registration should be set, including identification
           and a commitment to adhere to the code of conduct.

           f) Enforcement agents of copyright holders (e.g. law firms) should not be entitled to be
           registered in their own name; a valid notice from a registered party must be made with
           the authority of the registered party.
           A registered rightsholder may allow its agents (e.g. a law firm) to issue takedown
           notices on its behalf, but must be responsible for its agent's adherence to the code of
           conduct (and if they fail to comply, the registered party's registration should be at risk).

           g) The costs of operating the registration body, including the costs of hearing and
           deciding upon complaints and appeals against suspension, should be funded through a
           registration fee.
