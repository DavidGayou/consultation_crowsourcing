     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

GESAC is the grouping of 33 of the main authors’ societies (collective management organisations or
CMOs) from the EU, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, representing and administering the rights
and remuneration of almost 800 000 authors, composers and writers in a variety of sectors (music,
audio-visual, literary and visual and graphic arts) and music publishers.


GESAC will thus answer, where applicable and appropriate, in its capacity as 1) representative of
authors and composers, 2) representative of music publishers and 3) representative of collective
management organisations (CMOs). It is important to stress, here, as it is underlined in the new
directive on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of
rights in musical works for online uses in the internal market (CRM directive), that authors’
societies ‘are owned or controlled by [their] members’ (the right holders), ‘are organised on a not-
for-profit basis’ and act ‘for the collective benefit of rightholders’. Formed and governed by
authors, composers and publishers, CMOs therefore work to defend and protect their interests and
rights.


Please note that GESAC answers are written in “blue, without border lines, 11 font and Calibri”.
Where no answer is provided the space is left empty and in some instances the questions are
grouped to give a more comprehensive single common answer.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
When such licences are required, CMOs are willing and ready to deliver multi-territorial licences. The
demand from service providers for a multi-territorial access to protected works, however, has so far
been limited. Certain popular repertoires are being licensed on a pan-European basis and are readily
available through CMOs on a multi-territory basis, while certain others have never been asked for
such licences. For instance PRS for Music from the UK and SACEM from France each currently license
30 online music services on a pan-European basis for the repertoire they represent, whereas AKM
from Austria received only two pan-European licensing requests so far.

Similarly, in the visual arts sector the multi-territorial licences are available for all types of
exploitation and delivered by the CMOs whenever they are requested.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
    1) Recent European initiatives have shown that the EU legislative framework on copyright
       does not constitute a problem in terms of the availability and portability of online services
       offering copyright protected works across the EU.
    2) GESAC believes that collective management and voluntary aggregation of rights in the
       hands of CMOs is the most effective way to address music rights clearance for the cross-
       border availability and portability of creative content services.
    3) The new CRM Directive aims at promoting cross-border licensing of musical works and
       addressing any outstanding issues. Therefore, it would be premature to envisage any
       further initiative before its implementation.

The Commission’s introduction to this section is not fully accurate in relation to music and fails in
particular to mention the results of the Licences for Europe initiative where there was consensus that
there was satisfactory market development and cross-border availability and portability of music
services. As a result of the positive ongoing market developments, with extensive offers and
intensive licensing activities by rightholders, in particular by authors’ societies, the Commission did
not consider it necessary to hold any further working group meetings for music after the mid-term
plenary meeting. From the point of CMOs, there is no problem in terms of availability due to the EU
legislative framework on copyright, especially as CMOs are under an obligation to address all
licensing requests.

Furthermore, the CRM Directive was issued in order to “encourage and facilitate multi-territorial and
multi-repertoire licensing of author’s rights in musical works for online uses in the EU/EEA”
(IP/72/2012). The system it implements aims at streamlining the cross-border licensing process by
helping to improve current practices and addressing any possible remaining issues. Therefore, for the
sake of efficiency, no new initiative should be undertaken before the first report on the
implementation of the CRM directive.

Moreover, it appears that any measure concerning copyright appears premature because, in fact, the
problems that have been identified as preventing cross-border availability and portability of services
are not copyright related. The main issues that lead the commercial users to limit their services to a
certain territory are:

                                                                                                    11
- Business choices based on language, local marketing strategies focused on local interests, local
advertising market, return on investment, etc;
- Problems related to cross-border internet/broadband connection and roaming when abroad;
- Lack of efficient cross-border electronic payment structures, especially for young people, combined
with a lack of consumer trust in cross-border e-commerce.

In addition to these, high levels of piracy and unauthorised use of protected works discourage new
players from investing in the market, as they find it difficult to recoup their investment when
competing with wide availability of completely free unauthorised uses.

Therefore, the above-mentioned issues should be addressed as a priority to encourage businesses to
offer cross-border availability and portability of services.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  NO
GESAC would like to underline that, in particular for music, collective licensing is the most efficient
way to ensure the widest possible availability of as many repertoires as possible in the easiest way.

In the music sector, the rightholders aim to license as many cross border online service providers as
possible. Authors’ societies in particular seek to offer as many repertoires as possible on the widest
possible territory for online services.
However, as mentioned above in our answer to Question 3, the demand from online service
providers for a multi-territorial access to protected works has so far been limited. Certain popular
repertoires are indeed being licensed on a pan-European basis and are readily available through
CMOs on a multi-territory basis, while certain others have never been asked for such licences.


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples

                                                                                                    12
7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  NO – Please explain
As presented above as well as during the Licences for Europe initiative, there is no need for a
legislative change to increase the cross-border availability of content services as (i) these
constantly develop, (ii) the current copyright framework is not an obstacle to their growth and (iii)
the CRM Directive aims at promoting cross-border licensing.

The issue of “cross-border availability of content services at EU level” has been addressed for many
years at EU level through several initiatives of the European Commission, such as the Content Online
initiative, the Online Commerce Roundtable, “Licences for Europe” and recently the CRM Directive.
Positive developments and best practices have certainly emerged from those exercises, as briefly
presented above and in GESAC’s contributions to those initiatives at the time. The market has
evolved considerably. In the music sector, for instance, more than 300 legal services are offering
their services throughout the EU territory. CMOs in particular have made it possible through cross-
border licences to enable consumers to enjoy their favourite music anywhere, anytime and will
continue to do so in the framework of the CRM Directive. In this respect, the implementation of the
CRM Directive into national laws in such a way as to support and promote cooperation between
CMOs for the delivery of efficient and effective multi-repertoire and multi-territory licensing would
further strengthen this objective.

Therefore, there is no need for further measures at EU level to ensure cross-border availability of
content services.

As to the second part of the question, GESAC regrets that the Commission limits its intention to
ensuring an “adequate” level of protection, since the InfoSoc Directive sets a standard of “high level
of protection”. The InfoSoc Directive’s standard should remain the starting point for any
consideration by the EU of its copyright policy.

As a reminder, Recital 4 of the directive provides that:
“A harmonised legal framework on copyright and related rights, through increased legal certainty
and while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property, will foster substantial
investment in creativity and innovation, including network infrastructure, and lead in turn to growth
and increased competitiveness of European industry, both in the area of content provision and
information technology and more generally across a wide range of industrial and cultural sectors. This
will safeguard employment and encourage new job creation.”

And Recital 9 that:
“Any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take as a basis a high level of protection,
since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation. Their protection helps to ensure the maintenance
and development of creativity in the interests of authors, performers, producers, consumers, culture,
industry and the public at large. Intellectual property has therefore been recognised as an integral
part of property.”

This is a major issue considering the importance of creation in the EU economy that depends on a
large part on copyright and innovation (about 9.4 million jobs, and 4.2% of the EU GDP that amounts
to almost € 510 billion (source OHIM/EPO 2013)). The 2013 OHIM/EPO study underlines that IPR-
intensive industries account for 90% of the EU's trade with the rest of the world and copyright is one


                                                                                                     13
of the few sectors that has a positive net export value. Protecting author’s rights not only ensures
European creativity and cultural diversity, but also strengthens the EU’s economic competitiveness
globally.


B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               14
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES

     1) There does not appear to be any problem in practice where the scope of the making
        available right is concerned.
     2) The “country of origin principle” is certainly not acceptable. It goes against the interests
        that the InfoSoc Directive aims to protect and it is incapable of solving any of the problems
        presented in the DeWolf Study.

The question raised by the Commission relates to the constitutive elements of the making available
right provided for by Article 3.1 of the InfoSoc Directive, i.e. those that are necessary for its
application.

It clearly follows that it is not only the act of uploading that is relevant to the making available right
but also the additional requirement that the works are made available to the public.

It must be recalled that it ensues from the above-mentioned Article 3.1 that the right of making
available is part of the communication to the public act recognised to authors of protected works.

As indicated in the CJEU’s caselaw, the notion of communication to the public associates two
constitutive elements, i.e. an ‘act of communication’ of a work by means of making available and the
communication of that work to a ‘public’.

The act of uploading is indeed an “act of communication” in that it affords the user of a website an
access to the works that it contains, which are thus made available, irrespective of whether such user
uses, or not, the possibility that he is thus offered (judgment of the CJEU of 13 February 2014 in case
C 466/12, paragraph 19).

However, as indicated by the DeWolf Study, such an act also supposes for there to be a
communication to the public, that such making available is made available to a “public” and not to a
circle of people in a private sphere.

The availability to the public is therefore the necessary and determining condition for the application
of the right of making available and such right is therefore implemented where such availability
occurs, i.e. where the different potential users of the concerned website are situated.

GESAC must moreover observe that if the underlying idea in reducing the making available right
referred to in Article 3.1 of the Infosoc Directive is to find a justification to the application of the
concept of the country of origin, it must be recalled, as underlined by the De Wolf Study, that such


22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                            15
concept is fundamentally detrimental to the right holders, and can therefore not be approved by
them, in that it encourages forum shopping: a service provider can choose the country where it will
benefit from the most favorable conditions to exploit a work. Such criticism is incurred whatever the
retained criterion: location of the server, location of the economic residence, location of the person
uploading. Such location can very easily be changed. The criterion is also deceptively simple in
particular as regards companies with a complex and diversified structure and/or operations, e.g. if
several servers are used in different countries.

Such criterion is therefore totally unsatisfactory and we note that copyright was excluded from the
general principle of the country of origin in the E-commerce directive.i

As for determining the material acts of making available by taking into account the targeted public,
this also omits one of its characteristic elements and does not reflect the reality of the exploitation.
Thus, it does not take into account the persons who access the works if they are not targeted. Right
holders are thus prevented from exercising their rights on the basis of a subjective criterion: the
presumed intent of the service provider. The difficulty of implementation of such criterion must also
be underlined: does a website in French target France? Luxembourg? Wallonia? Switzerland?


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief23)?
     NO

There is no practical problem relating to the territorial scope of the making available right as
presented in answer to Question 8 above.

Please refer to the explanations in our answer to Question 8 above. GESAC believes that there are no
practical problems relating to the substance of the right when protected works are used on a cross-
border basis, as the right itself is harmonised at EU level.

Considering that all EU Member States and the European Union are party to the Berne Convention
and the fact that the CJEU has to a great extent harmonised the rules on authorship and originality of
the work, the above question raises issues that seem to be only theoretical and have no practical
impact while, on the contrary, the options discussed in the DeWolf Study could create serious
problems in terms of effectively protecting and enforcing authors’ rights. GESAC refers in particular
to the country of origin principle and the targeting approach which are not acceptable for the
reasons set out in answer to Question 8.


2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the


23
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                     16
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
     NO

     1) The application of two different rights to a certain type of exploitation is in no way a
        novelty.
     2) This situation has never created any problem or difficulty since rightholders cooperate with
        each other to provide the service providers with what is necessary to easily clear the
        relevant rights needed to operate their services.

GESAC has underlined in its answers to previous consultations that online exploitation is not the first
type of use for which clearance of reproduction and communication to the public rights is required in
combination. It has long been the case for both radio and television – including satellite –
broadcasting and it has never raised any difficulty because the CMOs offer these rights within a same
authorisation.

When the management of the rights is disassociated, as e.g. for the so-called Anglo-American
repertoire, there has been focus on finding solutions in the best interest of all rightholders and
commercial users. CMOs and publishers can and do form partnerships, in order to ensure that the
commercial user does not have to negotiate separate licences for the different rights in the same
works. Such re-aggregation of these two rights is an essential part of the efforts currently developed
by right holders to find appropriate solutions concerning licensing for online exploitation and GESAC
hopes that the new CRM Directive can also be instrumental in achieving these objectives by restoring
confidence in CMOs, based on transparency, good governance and efficiency.

Having both the reproduction right and the making available right, in fact, is very important for right
holders, as well as for the users, since this allows both sides to more appropriately determine the
applicable licensing scheme for each new business model. When seeking an equitable remuneration
for online exploitations, all technical steps involved in the concerned act must be considered in order
to take account of the individual intensity and scope of every use. For example there has to be a
strict separation of downloading and streaming and an even more precise distinction between
different kinds of downloads like “tethered” and “permanent”.

As stated above, no complications arise as a result of having two different rights as they are granted
by the same entity or within the same authorisation. The role of CMOs, in this sense, is indispensable
to make the market work efficiently and without complication.



3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU24 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of


24
     Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International) and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

                                                                                                          17
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU25 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why

The CJEU has very recently handed down its first judgement in the context of the question posed
(Svensson (C-466/12) adopted on 13 February 2014). GESAC has yet to conduct a full analysis. The
observations below should therefore be regarded as preliminary observations. .

Thus, after recalling the two cumulative criteria for there to be a communication to the public, i.e. an
act of communication of the work, and the communication of such work to the public, the CJEU
specified that the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely available on another
website does not constitute such an act of communication to the public.

Indeed, if the first condition is fulfilled because the provision of a clickable link to a protected work
affords a 'direct access' to it and thus constitutes a making available within the meaning of Article 3.1
of the Infosoc Directive, the second is not, according to the Court.

Within the framework of a communication concerning the same works as the initial communication
and made by the same technical means, the Court considers that 'public' refers not only to an
indeterminate and fairly large number of potential recipients but also to a new public, i.e. a public
which was not taken into account by the right holders when they authorized the initial
communication. The public of a website is according to the Court, by definition, unless measures are
taken to restrict access to its subscribers only, all of the Internet users.

Such an approach of the notion of public is not obvious insofar as it is possible to consider that the
Internet users do not form an indistinct whole, the public directed towards a protected work thanks
to a link provided by a website B being different than the public consulting directly such work on a
website A. It does not take into account neither the reality of the advertising practices which are
generally targeted depending on the awaited public nor the behaviour of website providers which
often seek to draw a new public thanks to an optimization of their referral.

Nevertheless the CJEU took care to specify that the authorisation of the right holders remains
necessary where the link enables access to a public "which was not taken account by the copyright
holders when they authorized the initial communication" (paragraph 31), which then constitutes a
new public compared to that initially taken into account by the right holders.

Thus, the right holders retain the possibility to take measures restricting to a determined public
access to a website, in which case any link enabling a larger public to access the content of such
website must be authorized by them.

It also follows from the decision that links to infringing content, and to sites whose terms and
conditions prohibit or place restrictions on linking, as well as to sites behind paywalls or with
technological protection schemes constitute communication to the public.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

The CJEU’s caselaw already provides answers which strike a balance between the different
interests at stake and offers the market a solution that enables it to develop while safeguarding
the rightholders’ interests.

Article 5(1) of the InfoSoc Directive provides that copyright in a literary and artistic work is not
infringed by the making of (1) a temporary copy which is (2) transient or incidental; and (3) an
integral and essential part of a technological process; and (4) the sole purpose of which is to enable
either a transmission of the work in a network between third parties by an intermediary or a lawful
use of the work; and (5) which has no independent economic significance.

In Infopaq Iii the CJEU clarified the requirements of Article 5(1) by pointing out that for a copy to be
“transient” it must be deleted automatically in the technological process and without human
intervention. However the Court also stated that “the possibility may not be ruled out that certain
isolated sentences, or even certain parts of sentences in the text in question, may be suitable for
conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article, by
communicating to that reader an element which is, in itself, the expression of the intellectual creation
of the author of that article. Such sentences or parts of sentences are, therefore, liable to come within
the scope of the protection provided for in Article 2(a) of that directive” (para. 47).

The decision of the Court was on the concept of “part” of the protected works in terms of 11 words
captured and reproduced by Infopaq from the newspaper articles and applicability of Art 5.1 of the
InfoSoc Directive as an exception to that reproduction made by Infopaq.

In the case of website viewing both a part and the whole of a protected work (e.g. a photograph, a
poem, part of a book, etc.) might be displayed on the screen of the device used by the consumer.
Recital 33 of the InfoSoc Directive provides some relevant elements on ‘browsing’ after it first
explains the conditions of Art 5.1 exception which we already elaborated above: “(…) To the extent
that they meet these conditions, this exception should include acts which enable browsing as well as
acts of caching to take place, including those which enable transmission systems to function
efficiently, provided that the intermediary does not modify the information and does not interfere
with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by industry, to obtain data on the use
of the information. A use should be considered lawful where it is authorised by the rightholder or not
restricted by law.”

It can be concluded that Art 5.1 of the InfoSoc Directive would not apply when those conditions are
not met, for instance when the reproduction on a web-page is not only an integral and essential part

                                                                                                      19
of a technological process but the intermediary interferes with the use of technology in order to
specifically make the protected content available to an end-user according to data obtained from the
user; or the sole purpose of it is not to allow a lawful use of the work but e.g. to enable an
unauthorised making available as presented in our answer to Question 11; or when such
reproduction has an independent commercial value because of the display of protected works on the
website (visual arts, literary works, etc.) against the will of their rightholders.

The CJEU in its Infopaq IIiii ruling also clarified that the Art 5.1 exception to reproduction right only
applies where the uses

–         fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a
technological process, notwithstanding the fact that they initiate and terminate that process and
involve human intervention;

–     fulfil the condition that those acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely to enable
the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter;

–         fulfil the condition that those acts must not have an independent economic significance
provided, first, that the implementation of those acts does not enable the generation of an additional
profit going beyond that derived from the lawful use of the protected work and, secondly, that the
acts of temporary reproduction do not lead to a modification of that work.

As mentioned earlier the above explanations based on Infopaq I and II rulings were based on
applicability of Art 5.1 exception to reproduction right under certain conditions. Furthermore,
viewing such protected works on website might involve other rights as well. Therefore, it is to be
noted that where viewing of a website or displaying protected works on a website constitutes a
communication to the public and making available under Art 3 of the InfoSoc Directive, this should
also be taken in to account to decide on the applicable rules to the act in question.


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)26. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)27. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of

26
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
27
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              20

[Open question]

Application of the exhaustion principle to digital transmissions under the InfoSoc Directive would
have significant economic and legal implications:

1. Economically:
 since resellers might not destroy originals (which cannot be verified), the very justification of
     the application of the principle would be missing and
 as the resold file is identical to the original, prices for the original files will be driven down
     inexorably. There is therefore significant foreseeable harm to authors, publishers and to
     online services in terms of the impact on supply and value in the market.

2. The legal basis of such a proposition would also be totally unjustified since:
 only the distribution right can be subject to exhaustion;
 the key criterion to determine whether there is reproduction or distribution is the existence of
    a fixation of a work on different carriers;
 downloading necessarily involves the [carrying out of a] reproduction right since a downloaded
    work must, upon each download, be fixed on a different carrier. The deletion of the original
    file from which the downloads were operated is indifferent to the exercise of the reproduction
    right which occurs upon each fixation of the work
 downloading necessarily involves the [carrying out of] communication to public right since the
    downloaded work is (i) upon each download, made available to the public so that anyone can
    access it from anywhere and at any time he chooses and (ii) transmitted by wire or wireless
    means.
 Therefore reselling of copyright protected works cannot lead to exhaustion, since the
    transmission and download necessarily implies a reproduction and a communication to the
    public.

GESAC believes that the answer to this question does not require a sector-specific answer (music,
visual arts, audiovisual, etc.) since the exhaustion of rights in digital format is in contradiction with
the protection of copyright and related rights that are recognised under the 2001 InfoSoc Directive
and international conventions.

Whether or not a “copyright work” or “creative content” is subject to the exhaustion principle is
completely related to its material form. Under EU law, the application of the exhaustion principle in
the field of copyright is treated differently depending on the form of the creative content.



                                                                                                      21
Case law and Directive provisionsiv clearly accept the exhaustion of “distribution right” under
copyright law with the first sale of the physical copies of the product in which the copyright works
are incorporated and that applies to the actual copy sold. That right is exhausted with regards to the
copies distributed once copies of the work are placed on the market with the consent of the
rightholder. This is a community exhaustion and “international exhaustion” and parallel imports are
not allowed, as ruled by the CJEU in its Laserdiskenv judgement as well.

However, the question of the exhaustion of rights does not arise in the same way where services
rather than goods are supplied. The CJEU has ruled that a rightholder who authorises one broadcast
of a film in one section of the Community territory does not exhaust his rights over later broadcasts
or broadcasts in other parts of the Communityvi and that the sale of copies of a video cassette does
not exhaust the right to authorise or prohibit hiring out,vii as both communication to the public and
rental are considered as services and there are no actual copies with regards to which the exhaustion
could be applied.

Recital 29 of the InfoSoc Directive has further clarified this issue by saying that: “The question of
exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and on-line services in particular. This also applies
with regard to a material copy of a work or other subject-matter made by a user of such a service
with the consent of the rightholder. Therefore, the same applies to rental and lending of the original
and copies of works or other subject-matter which are services by nature. Unlike CD-ROM or CD-I,
where the intellectual property is incorporated in a material medium, namely an item of goods, every
on-line service is in fact an act which should be subject to authorisation where the copyright or
related right so provides.”

The UsedSoft decision in which the CJEU recently considered application of the exhaustion principle
in case of a download of a computer programme (C-128/11 Oracle v. UsedSoft) cannot usefully be
used as a reference.

First, although the CJEU considered that under certain circumstances the download of a computer
programme can be subject to the exhaustion principle, it also clarified in par. 60 that: “It is true that
the concepts used in Directives 2001/29 and 2009/24 must in principle have the same meaning (see
Joined Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08 Football Association Premier League and Others [2011] ECR
I-0000, paragraphs 187 and 188). However, even supposing that Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/29,
interpreted in the light of recitals 28 and 29 in its preamble and in the light of the Copyright Treaty,
which Directive 2001/29 aims to implement (Case C-277/10 Luksan [2012] ECR I-0000, paragraph 59),
indicated that, for the works covered by that directive, the exhaustion of the distribution right
concerned only tangible objects, that would not be capable of affecting the interpretation of Article
4(2) of Directive 2009/24, having regard to the different intention expressed by the European Union
legislature in the specific context of that directive.”

Then, digital transmissions of copyright protected works involve both the making available right,
which under the InfoSoc Directive is part of the communication to the public, contrary to what is
provided in the Software directive, and a reproduction right.

As regards the making available right, Recital 23 of the InfoSoc Directive specifies that “This Directive
should harmonise further the author's right of communication to the public. This right should be
understood in a broad sense covering all communication to the public not present at the place where
the communication originates. This right should cover any such transmission or retransmission of a
work to the public by wire or wireless means, including broadcasting. This right should not cover any
other acts”.



                                                                                                      22
And Article 3.1 also includes within the communication to the public right “the making available to
the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and
at a time individually chosen by them”.

As evidenced by the preparatory work on the InfoSoc Directive, this inclusion testifies of the wish of
the European legislator to:

    -   Implement Article 8 of the WIPO Treaty on Copyright of 20 december 1996;
    -   Harmonise the legislation of the Member States on this issue;
    -   Include on demand transmission of works in the communication to the public.

As regards the reproduction right, we note that the re-selling of digital files naturally involves new
reproductions of protected works and exhaustion applies only to the distribution of copies but not to
reproductions of protected works. Otherwise the reproduction right would be completely
meaningless. Indeed, the buyer of a re-sold digital file will need to make a new copy on his/her
computer and the online service providing this possibility is very likely to make a copy in its server as
well. Even if the service deleted the copy in the seller’s device after the transfer of the file to the
buyer, such an act would still create a new and distinct reproduction of the work in the buyer’s
device without the authorisation of the rightholders (and also possibly on the server of the service
provider).

A case directly about the resale of mp3 music files was recently decided in the US.viii An online service
called ReDigi offered the possibility to consumers of re-selling the music files bought from iTunes
through its website and dedicated software based on the “first sale” doctrine in the US. The court
decided that the process of moving a digital music file from one hard drive (the user's computer) to
other hard drives (ReDigi's server and, eventually, the buyer's computer) involves rewriting the file.
And this rewriting constitutes unauthorised reproduction of the copyrighted work. The court found
the final number of mp3s that exist irrelevant, since what copyright concerns is that unauthorised
copies were made along the way. Moreover, because ReDigi also made a new copy in its server to
accommodate the resale of mp3 files through its software, it was also considered that it infringed the
distribution right of copyright owners, since the copy made on the server that allows further resale
was not authorised and the first sale doctrine only applies to “first sales” that are lawfully made.

The provision of EU law is therefore very clear on exhaustion.

However, considering that the question asks to have further views on the possible consequences
of any change to this rule in EU law, the following non-exhaustive list of issues should certainly be
taken into account:

1) It is very clearly regulated in Art 3(3) of the InfoSoc Directive that exhaustion does not occur in
the case of the making available right and in Recital 29 that the question of exhaustion does not
arise in the case of services and online services in particular.
2) The reason to allow exhaustion of rights for physical copies is to be able to determine the
rightful owner (in this case the holder) of the copy for further circulation. Moreover, the transfer of
ownership of the copy in further circulation is a key element of the exhaustion principle. However
in the digital environment, this could only be managed, if it could, by very well established and
effective DRMs, which are progressively proven as being inconvenient and not functional due to
consumer rights and interoperability concerns. Moreover, even where applied their immediate
circumvention on internet makes it in many instances a pointless effort.
3) The primary problem with the online dissemination of the digital content is not always the
market prices which would be eliminated by second-hand markets, but the sharing that occurs
through P2P networks and BitTorrent platforms for free. Allowing free circulation of creative

                                                                                                      23
content in the single market upon its first sale would practically legalise all those uses on the
Internet (as being a further distribution) which has been called piracy so far. Furthermore, even if a
second-hand market emerges, determination of the legality of the copies, in a situation where
already millions of illicit copies are circulating, would be extremely difficult and giving the holders
of illicit copies the right to sell them would be rewarding piracy.


C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute28. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered29.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     NO


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
GESAC will answer the questions 16, 17 and 18 together.


      1) Collective management organisations are already maintaining voluntary registration
         databases which are a source of comprehensive rights’ information and they are constantly
         working on addressing the evolving needs of the market.
      2) The creation of a registration system at EU level is therefore unnecessary and, on the
         contrary, would be counterproductive and also detrimental.
      3) Only major rightholders that would be able and/or have the means to use a European
         system would also register their rights in parallel to already existing databases: this would
         create two levels of protection, which would be to the detriment of smaller rightholders
         and create confusion and legal uncertainty for the users.
      4) Moreover, envisaging a registry system that would become a condition for the protection
         and exercise of rights would also be in contradiction with the Berne Convention and TRIPS
         Agreement

The importance of data and of the use of repertoire databases for efficient and effective rights’
management has also been referred to in the new CRM Directive. GESAC believes that data handling
and the existence of efficient and transparent databases are key for good management of rights.

28
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
29
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             24
However, the difference between registries and industry databases is that the first model is static
(and records the existence of a work and its first owner) and the other is dynamic (recording up to
date changes in the chain of title). Industry databases have the critical functionality to determine
rights’ ownership status of the works at the time when they are used, and thus supporting efficient
licensing and accurate payment.

In order for a database to be effective and functional for licensing, it needs to be dynamic, elaborate,
fit for purpose and interoperable with the other metadata databases, reporting and dispute
resolution processes used by the sector.

Therefore, this issue can best be dealt with by the industry in each sector according to the needs of
that sector in a way that is functional and purposeful both for users and rightholders.

As referred to in the introduction to this part of the questionnaire, EU law provided for a registry for
orphan works, in which the owner of the works cannot be found. However this cannot be used as an
example to justify such a model for the normal functioning markets, since the very specific reason of
orphan works registry is:
a. the information is static – a work is either orphan or not. It moves off the database but
    ownership does not change/is not dynamic.
b. without public policy intervention, no one would invest in it
c. it provides a central authorised list.

The creation of a general registration system at EU level for all copyright works would be justified
only if it had a clear benefit for those who use this registry and also for all creators and rightholders.
Having a static source of information that is costly and impractical would certainly not serve this
purpose.

Moreover, as the Berne Convention prohibits subjecting the existence of the rights of the copyright
holder in its creative work to any mandatory formalities, such a European registry can only be an
option that rightholders can use but not an obligation. Consequently, it will create a two tier system
of copyright. In a system of optional registration there will be two categories of copyright works:
registered works and non-registered works. GESAC fears that at least de facto registered works will
enjoy a higher level of protection than non-registered works.

Such a development would be to the detriment of small, independent and semi-professional
creators. Experience in the US shows that especially small and independent creators are reluctant or
cannot afford to spend the time, money, and effort to register their copyright with the US Copyright
Office. Therefore, the foreseeable outcome is that large corporate rights holders will register their
commercially successful works while individuals’ works would remain unregistered. As it is to be
expected that copyright enforcement will concentrate on the registered works, non-registered works
could be publicly regarded to be less protected than registered works. Indeed, non-registration could
be conceived as a form of waiver of the enforcement of the exclusive right. This would counteract
the efforts of the harmonised protection standards sought by international treaties and the EU law.


D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are

                                                                                                       25
specific to the sector in which they have been developed30, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database31 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition32 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub33 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]


GESAC has always advocated that data is key for sound and reliable rights’ management and GESAC
societies work hard to implement the state of the art technologies and databases to deliver the best
management solutions for their members. GESAC welcomes the new CRM Directive that reiterates
the importance of accommodating such databases and identifiers.

Common standards have been developed over decades (ISWC, DOI, ISRC, ISBN, IPI, etc.). Particularly
for on line exploitation of music some standard formats for identifiers and data exchange are already
in place as voluntary industry initiatives and are used by societies, rightholders and DSPs. The DDEX
format (Digital Data Exchange) is developed constantly to meet the digital business needs, based on
the cooperation of different stakeholders.

They require investment and ongoing costs to maintain but more important than that they need to
be actively adopted and used by the entire supply chain. Such investments by rightsholders cannot
be made in isolation or without the clear commitment from producers, broadcasters and users of
rights and intermediaries to adopt systems so that they materially improve the quality of data
provided to rightsholders. The European Commission could facilitate such agreements, using their
convening powers, and assist in the endorsement and funding of new initiatives.


E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention34 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.

30
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain

    1) Shortening the term of protection would limit the ability of creators to determine the best
       way to exploit their rights based on the period of exclusivity they enjoy in a context where
       copyright protected works can be better preserved for a longer time.
    2) Considering such a harmful option – in this respect, the importance of the cultural industry
       in the EU economy should not be forgotten – without any economic assessment is highly
       questionable, all the more so as the life of the author and 70 years after his/her death is a
       term of protection which is adopted in a large part of the world.

The EU policy makers recently considered the term of protection issue and decided to keep this
period and even to extend it for the protection of sound-recordings, as well as for the works of joint
authorship.

GESAC believes that re-considering a policy issue which has only recently been enacted as law is not
an appropriate way of policy making.

GESAC also wonders what would be the positive impact of a change that would take away an already
existing term of protection from the hands of authors, as there is no practical or economic evidence
that suggests shortening the term of protection would result in a better situation for rightholders,
commercial users or the public. Consumer and user interests are served by the current term of
protection, because it drives investment in new and culturally diverse works. Moreover, new
technologies give rise to new and better recording and preservation possibilities for copyright works
by keeping their use, dissemination to the public, relevance and significance for a longer and longer
period.

We query the policy justification for changing the term of protection considering the significant value
of those rights for the EU economy. The recent Study of OHIM and EPO indicates that about 3,2% of
the total economic activity in the EU (worth some €7.05 million annually) is generated by copyright-
intensive industries, and that those industries contribute 4.2% of the EU’s GDP. Cultural and creative
sectors create and support home-grown jobs and employment, as well as ensure the welfare of
society. Copyright protection is key for those sectors to sustain their income.

If the EU intends to do anything useful in this respect, it should focus its efforts more on how to
enable individual authors to better and more effectively benefit from their copyright within this
period.




                                                                                                    27
 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC35.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law36. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 37, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional38, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")39.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
37
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
38
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
39
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            28
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Please find GESAC’s answer to questions 21 to 27:


    1) GESAC is of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide the
       necessary flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations thereto.
    2) There is no need to introduce any new exception or to make the available exceptions
       under the InfoSoc Directive mandatory, since there is no evidenced need for such a
       legislative change.
    3) CMOs provide the necessary solutions for widespread access to works through dedicated
       licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions, research, etc., so that an exception is
       not required to give access. These solutions are more flexible, broader and give more
       clarity on terms and conditions of use of works.
    4) GESAC is fundamentally against the introduction of a US-type fair use exception in Europe.
       Fair use is incompatible with the EU legal system and tradition, would only create legal
       uncertainty and give rise to a higher number of disputes and court cases which would be
       fundamentally in contradiction with the Single Market objectives.

GESAC is of the opinion that the current exhaustive and optional list of exceptions and limitations
does not create a significant problem that needs to be dealt with by regulation in the Single Market.




                                                                                                  29
First of all, most of those exceptions and limitations do not have a cross-border aspect and where
they have, the market is capable of finding solutions that address the actual issues as long as the
stakeholders have the willingness to address them.

GESAC believes that there is no need to make any other exceptions and limitations mandatory or add
or remove any exceptions and limitations to the existing catalogue. Member States have so far not
adopted all the existing exceptions from the broad list provided by the InfoSoc Directive, showing
there is little or no demand.

Moreover, GESAC also believes that collective licensing of rights is a better alternative to an
exception since it provides users with an easier access to protected content, offers them with the
needed legal certainty, while protecting the legitimate interest of rightholders.

GESAC seriously doubts the necessity to change the European legal framework relating to the
exceptions and limitations to copyright with the aim of creating more flexibility, when there is no
clear evidence showing any need for it and when the users are already provided with the necessary
flexibility according to their needs, if any of their usages does not fall under an exception.

In this respect, GESAC would also like to express its strong objection to the introduction of a general
‘fair use’ exception into EU law in the name of the need for more flexibility. Such a system would
create a huge legal uncertainty and benefit mainly non-EU internet giants that aim at reducing their
liabilities under EU law by using ‘fair use’ in the courts across Europe relying on their deep pockets, at
the expense of creators. Indeed, since fair use is only a defence against an alleged infringement of
copyright, its existence and viability needs to be established by the courts every time it is claimed.
Since a general fair use exception is not specific to a certain type of usage, the end-user always needs
to consider whether a certain usage would be covered by fair use and the legal costs of bringing an
action to the court relying on this defence, since it might require lengthy and not predictable legal
proceedings. On the other hand the European system provides a list of specific exception cases and
an overall three-step-test that justifies the overall scope of all exceptions. This allows the end-users
to benefit from clear exceptions and help them to “easily figure out which acts fall under the
exception and which uses of copyrighted work are allowed without the authorisation of the author
and which are not” (DeWolf Study, p 535). In the US, where the fair use doctrine applies, the
principles were established following 200 years of decisions which enabled to build a substantial
binding case law and they are still far from yielding the legal certainty which is necessary to carry out
an economic activity.

During the copyright debates in the US, the US Copyright Office stated that: “The safest course is to
get permission from the copyright owner before using copyrighted material. The Copyright Office
cannot give this permission. When it is impracticable to obtain permission, you should consider
avoiding the use of copyrighted material unless you are confident that the doctrine of fair use would
apply to the situation. The Copyright Office can neither determine whether a particular use may be
considered fair nor advise on possible copyright violations. If there is any doubt, it is advisable to
consult an attorney.”ix
 Moreover the Director of the US Copyright Office Maria Pallante also elaborated that “Fair use is ill
suited as vehicle for bright line rules or more systematic activities of users…”x

The DeWolf Study also states that: “At the European level, a complete switch from the current
European system of legally defined exceptions to an open-ended, fair-use like regime, does not
receive much support from academics and stakeholders. First, because it makes little sense to
completely abandon a legal tradition that has existed from hundreds of years, to adopt a system that
is not familiar at all to European lawyers. Then, because it would imply the creation of legal
uncertainty at a large scale, which is highly unwelcome. Legal uncertainty in the US fair use system is

                                                                                                       30
mitigated by more than two hundreds of years of binding case law, which provides thousands of
examples of application of the fair use criteria in particular cases. The adoption, from scratch, of a
similar system in the EU would lack this fundamental element and leave practitioners and courts in
great uncertainty when it comes to predict the application of, and to apply such a norm to individual
cases. We follow the views expressed by Ian Hargreaves in his 2011 review that promoting a Fair Use
Copyright exception in the EU is not the best solution, because the economic benefits of a more
adaptative copyright regime are more likely to be attained in practice otherwise and because there
are genuine legal doubts about the viability of a US case law based legal mechanism in a European
context.”


A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving40 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions41. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive42.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.



GESAC is of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary
flexibility for copyright and exceptions and limitations thereto. There is currently no need to
introduce any new exception or to make the available exceptions under the InfoSoc Directive
mandatory, since there is no evidenced need for such a legislative change. Moreover CMOs provide
the necessary solutions through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions,
research, etc.



1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number

                                                                                                   31
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]


CMOs are licensing e-lending of music files by libraries and other institutions since these activities are
an exploitation of copyright protected works. E-lending in particular has all the same characteristics
as a commercial market in that it gives an infinite number of people access to an infinite number of
digital files in the library at the same time. E-lending therefore has the same economic impact and
market characteristics as commercial services that invest in streaming, downloading and other
means to deliver services to consumers. It is therefore very different in impact from ‘on premises’
consultation and physical lending where a limited number of people have access to individual copies
of physical for specific and limited periods of time. There is therefore no reason for an exception for
e-lending. The De Wolf Study provides support for this argument. It would also cut across licences by
rightsholders for these activities and would therefore also fail the so-called “three-step-test”.


4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other43. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and

publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)44.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

B.       Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC45 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework

44
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

GESAC is of the opinion that current EU law and international treaties provide the necessary

introduce any new exception or to make the available exceptions under the InfoSoc Directive
mandatory, since there is no evidenced need for such a legislative change. Moreover CMOs provide
the necessary solutions through dedicated licensing for e.g. teaching, educational institutions,
research, etc.



C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC47 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 48.

The Marrakesh Treaty49 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics50 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”51. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that

a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
  NO – Please explain


In our view, text and data mining constitutes use in copyright terms. However this not an InfoSoc
Directive related issue. Such issue is to be considered under the Database Directive. Depending on
the technology chosen by the miner or his/her technical contributor, the behaviour is either
reproduction or falls within the scope of the general rule on the exploitation of works that is subject
to the authorisation of the right holder. In the case of databases, Article 7 (5) of the Database
Directive is extremely relevant in this respect. (The repeated and systematic extraction and/or re-
utilisation of insubstantial parts of the contents of the database implying acts which conflict with a
normal exploitation of that database or which unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
maker of the database shall not be permitted.)
There is not any exception (free use) in this regard. Presumably, such a broad exception that would
permit data and text mining in general would conflict with the Member States’ international
obligations.


54.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


It would be possible to introduce the rule of a properly defined free text/data mining for educational
or scientific purposes without permitting the making of a permanent copy. It should be however
clear that privileged data (personal data, trade secrets etc.) shall not be subject to the exception, and
the exclusive database right with regards to the insubstantial parts of databases should not be
eroded by the exception. In addition - with due regard to the sensitive, privileged data - TPM should
be privileged in relation to any possible new exception. Commercial uses should not fall within the
scope of the text/data mining. It is worth considering also applying the exception of the citation to
the data mining. It would mean that the indication of the source (respect of moral rights) as well as
the proportionality of the citation could also be applied to the new eventual exception of data
mining.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs52. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated



52
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound

sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

Please find below GESAC’s views on and answers to questions 58 to 63.


      1) In the absence of any established definition of ‘user-generated content’, it is extremely
         difficult, if not impossible, to assess if there are any difficulties and, if there are, their scope
         and any possible solution. The lack of a common definition was probably the only common
         understanding in the UGC Working Group of the Licences for Europe initiative.
      2) Platforms that distribute UGC are major digital content services and are very fast
         developing with an evolving end-user interaction with copyright works.
      3) Therefore as a principle GESAC stresses that:

          a) CMOs wish to enable UGC platforms to continue their activity and encourage the
             creativity of the public but this requires that the platforms accept their liability as
             digital service providers and license the relevant rights involved for full value for
53

                                                                                                          41
           operating such services and do not try to avoid their liability by invoking the safe
           harbour provisions of the E-Commerce Directive,
        b) There is no clear definition of UGC on which to evaluate a clear policy line and
           European policy makers should refrain from dealing with issues until they have been
           defined,
        c) There is no evidence - legal, economic or social - which indicates that the copyright
           framework creates a chilling-effect that might restrict people’s exercise of freedom of
           speech or participation to public debate,
        d) The fact that members of the public engage with protected works with non-
           commercial purposes is not relevant to justify an exception for UGC, since the
           platforms offering UGC services are clearly commercial. In fact those platforms are also
           used for commercial purposes and what a consumer might see as non-commercial can
           still have economic impact on the author. Furthermore such criterion does not take
           into account the evolving nature of exploitation of a protected work: a work created
           for non-commercial purposes may very quickly have a great success and tip into the
           commercial sphere. Moreover being commercial or not is not a relevant criterion in
           copyright law, since the use of exclusive rights requires an authorisation anyway.

    4) For all the above reasons, GESAC believes that there is no need for legislation and, even if
       it were considered, a UGC exception would be unjustified and contrary to the objectives
       sought by a sound European Digital Agenda.

UGC platforms are certainly one of the most important services where creative works are enjoyed by
end-users; music-related traffic on YouTube is significantly higher than purely music services such as
Deezer and Spotify.

These platforms give various possibilities to end-users to enjoy copyright works in different manners
and to use those works to express themselves, through interaction, whether for artistic, political or
entertainment purposes.

GESAC believes that end-users should be able to enjoy and to continue to interact with creative
works made available by rightholders on those platforms in the way they desire, provided that the
necessary rights are cleared.

However, as recalled in the introduction to this part, such interaction can vary considerably: it can go
from the simple juxtaposition of pre-existing works to the adaptation of one or more pre-existing
work(s) to the creation of completely new works.

Therefore, as different situations call for different solutions, a clear assessment of the situation
requires a clear definition of the concepts at stake as stressed by the DeWolf Study. The Study
explains that it is extremely difficult to clearly define what is UGC in order to determine which rights
would be applicable or which right would be subject to exception or limitation. Indeed, the only
conclusion agreed by all the parties in the UGC Working Group of Licences for Europe initiative was
that no one has the same understanding/definition of UGC.

In this respect, GESAC needs to stress that CMOs are willing and intent on providing a framework to
the benefit of users, service providers and rightholders alike. They are seeking to promote licensing
solutions.

They have thus already entered into agreements with some UGC platforms and licensed the rights
that are entrusted to them, i.e. communication to the public, including making available, and


                                                                                                     42
reproduction rights. As the adaptation right is not held by CMOs, it cannot be licensed by a CMO
unless it is agreed by the relevant rightholders.

Thus also, GESAC, as a result of the Licences for Europe initiative, has engaged in discussions with its
author and publisher members with a view to finding ways to efficiently and easily license those
rights in a more streamlined and easier way for users (the platforms). GESAC has also committed to
developing best practice guidelines for small-scale licensing and started a dialogue with its publisher
and author members to offer easier and more-streamlined licensing of online small-scale users on a
multi-territorial basis.

However, the conclusion of agreements with platforms is difficult: these processes usually take a
very long time and in some cases result in lengthy court proceedings, since the platforms rely on
‘safe harbour’ regime provided by the E-Commerce Directive to avoid any legal liability for the
content used on their platforms. In a number of cases CMOs managed to conclude an agreement
with those platforms, however those schemes are far from creating a legal certainty for authors and
composers for future agreements, since the platforms can always use the ‘safe harbour’ argument
not to renew their existing agreement or to refuse such requests, whenever they see this as a better
strategy. As stated above some of those platforms are the biggest players in the market right now
and they have an extremely dominant position in the new media landscape, which enable them to
dictate their own rules.

In this respect, it is important to stress that, in order to ensure a vibrant and sustainable market and
more comfort for consumers to engage with creative content, platforms offering UGC services need
to accept their liability to get a licence for the services they offer, which depends greatly on the use
of copyright content and designed to access and enjoy those content that is protected by copyright.

GESAC needs to add that introducing a UGC exception would have extremely detrimental effects for
the creative sector.

First of all using a criterion of “non-commercial usage” is completely flawed in particular in the online
environment. The disseminators of UGC content are the internet giants that generate huge benefits
from the use and engagement of consumers with UGC and this is the reason why such an exception
is first called for by those companies. Consideration of such an option, therefore, would be a huge
policy failure, since that would mean giving an entirely commercial sector complete immunity at the
expense of the European cultural and creative sector.

Moreover, the fact that there is no evidence at all that suggests any inconvenience or chilling-effect
of the current legal framework on UGC (no court cases, no economic evidence, no clear statement
from the participants of the Licences for Europe initiative) makes it even more unacceptable as a
European policy option. The DeWolf Study also underlines this point by concluding that a new
sweeping UGC exception would be unnecessary (DeWolf Study p 534).

GESAC agrees with the analysis of professor Ficsor, which is also quoted and supported by the
DeWolf Study, stating that ““the mere reason that a derivative work is created and made available
and that therefore it should be free in order to guarantee the freedom of expression is hardly an
acceptable reason alone since Article 12 and 14(1) of the Berne Convention provide for an exclusive
right of adaptation which “by definition” covers the creation of derivative works”.

Therefore GESAC suggests that the debate on modernisation of copyright can address the specific
copyright related aspects of internet intermediaries to bring more legal certainty to this sector and to
achieve a more vibrant and satisfactory digital environment for rightholders, UGC platforms and the
public in general.

                                                                                                      43
     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying54. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5556.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions57 in the digital environment?
  NO – Please explain


      1) The CJEU has given the necessary interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of
         private copying exception and since the interpretation of other substantive issues are
         currently pending with the Court, there is no need to deal further with the scope and
         application of the system at EU level.
      2) Rightholders have provided all the necessary practical and operational solutions to
         implement those decisions for a smoother and more streamlined functioning of the
         Internal Market.

      Currently the only missing element is the willingness of the manufacturers and distributors of
      recording devices (almost all of which are non-EU companies) to comply with EU law.

GESAC is of the opinion that private copying remuneration schemes are a key element of the Digital
Eco-System and of the European cultural and artistic scene. They constitute a win-win model for all
stakeholders including Member States as long as everybody plays the game. They are fully

compatible with new business models, the development of new products and services and
contribute to the dynamism of the market.

GESAC regrets that the introduction given by the Commission to this part of the questionnaire does
not give any reference to the rulings of the CJEU, which has consistently clarified and emphasised
important principles on the private copying exception and its accompanying compensation. The
Court also justified, to a great extent, the existing implementation of the private copy remuneration
schemes in those rulings.

GESAC therefore believes that since those recent decisions of the CJEU gave the necessary
interpretation and guidelines to clarify the application of the private copying exception and since the
other outstanding substantial issues are currently dealt with by the pending cases of the Court, there
is no need to further deal with the scope and application of the system at EU level.

As regards the scope and application of private copying exception and accompanying fair
compensation the Court ruled that:

1- concerning copies made for professional uses:

In its Padawan ruling (C-467/08), the CJEU held that Article 5.2.b) of the InfoSoc Directive must be
interpreted as excluding from the private copying remuneration media or devices which are not used
for private purposes.

Insofar as a company can purchase media or devices which will be used for private copying (such is in
particular the case of mobile phones which are purchased by a company and given to its employees
who will use it for both professional and private purposes), the CJEU subjected the non-applicability
of the private copying remuneration both to the purchase of the medium or device by a person not
acting for a private purpose and to the fact that these media and devices are clearly reserved for
purposes other than private.

Therefore it is the nature of the usage which is key in determining the applicability of the private
copying remuneration and not the person buying the media or devices, as was confirmed by the
Court in its Amazon ruling (C-521/11).

As for the implementation of such principle, it was decided in the Amazon ruling that it is perfectly
possible to subject legal persons to the private copying remuneration while excluding purely
professional usages by organizing (i) an exoneration scheme when it is certain that the media or
devices purchased by such legal persons are so for professional purposes only (eg DVDs purchased by
a medical imagery office) or (ii) in other cases, to an effective reimbursement scheme upon
justification of the usage of such media or devices where there are sufficient practical difficulties to
determine the purpose of the use of the purchased medium or device.

It is also possible to provide for a presumption of private copying use enabling the application of the
remuneration for private copying when the media and carriers are purchased by private persons
provided:

a) there are sufficient practical difficulties to determine the purpose of the use of the media and
carrier purchased;
b) the presumption is rebuttable - this to avoid imposing a remuneration outside of a situation of
private copying.



                                                                                                     45
2- concerning the payee of the private copying remuneration

Given the practical difficulties in identifying private users and in obliging them to compensate
rightholders, the Court ruled in its Padawan decision that it is open to the Member States to establish
a ‘private copying levy’ for the purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable not to the private
persons concerned but to those who have the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media
and who make that equipment available to private users or who provide copying services for them

3- concerning the coexistence of a contractual authorization and the private copying exception

In its VG Wort decision (C-457/11 to 460/11), the CJEU held that where a Member State has decided
to introduce in its national law the private copying exception, the authorization granted by the
rightholders to allow the making of private copies is devoid of any legal effect.

It also clearly stated that insofar as a contractual authorization to allow the making of private copies
has no legal object, it cannot have any bearing on the fair compensation which constitutes its
recompense.

4- concerning social and cultural actions

After stressing that the InfoSoc Directive does not impose on Member States the obligation to ensure
to rightholders the payment of all of the private copying remuneration, the CJEU ruled, in its Amazon
decision, that Member States enjoy a wide discretion and therefore could provide that part of that
remuneration can be provided in the form of indirect compensation as long as the scheme
implemented actually benefitted the rights holders and was not discriminatory.

5- concerning the cross border trade of recording media and devices

After recalling that Member States which introduced the private copying exception have an
obligation to achieve a certain result in the sense that they must guarantee to the right holders the
actual payment of a fair compensation to compensate the harm arisen on their territory (as held by
the Court in its Opus ruling (C-462/09)) and that the harm to be compensated materializes not at the
level of the transfer of the recording media or devices but with the reproduction carried out on such
media or devices by a person for a private use, the CJEU held, in its Amazon judgment, that when the
place of transfer of the media and the place where the reproduction on such media or devices occurs
are not the same, it is the latter point of contact which must prevail.

The fact that there has been a first payment of the private copying remuneration in the country of
transfer cannot be an obstacle to the payment of an analogous remuneration in the country of
destination of the medium or device as it is the place where the harm is characterised.

6/ concerning the DRMs

In the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to 460/11), the CJEU specified that the existence of a technological
measure is not intended to eliminate the exception for private copying when the national law of the
concerned Member State recognizes such exception. Only the level of fair compensation can vary
depending on the application of a DRM.

Pending cases ACI Adam (C‑435/12), CopyDan (Case C-463/12) and Hewlett Packard Belgium (Case
C-572/13) will clarify the outstanding issues, such as consideration of copies made from illegal
sources and calculation of the amount of levies paid by the manufacturers and distributors of
recording devices that are subject to private copy levies.

                                                                                                     46
CMOs offer and promote solutions that implement the above-mentioned rulings and that would ease
cross-border trade in the Single Market, however the manufacturers and distributors of devices,
almost all of which are non-EU companies, reject and avoid any solutions in this respect and resist to
comply with the EU law, since their primary objective is maximising their profits by not paying any
levies at all at the expense of creators and European creative sector.


65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?58
     YES – Please explain

Licensing and application of the private copying levies co-exist and they are not mutually exclusive.
This point of law has also been clarified by the CJEU in its VG Wort v. Kyocera ruling.

The question is not very clear, since the concept of ‘minimal harm’ is confused with the question of
application of levies when a service is licensed. Therefore GESAC’s answer will focus on the impact of
a contractual authorisation on the application of the private copying exception, which was also
addressed by Mr Vitorino’s report, as referred to in footnote 59. In this respect, GESAC regrets that
the questionnaire mentions Mr. Vitorino’s Report but not GESAC’s answer to it.

By stating in the first Recommendation (in Part 1 “New Business Models, Licensed Services and the
Private Copying Exception”) that copies made by end-users for private purposes from a licensed
service do not cause any harm (therefore not requiring the corresponding remuneration from private
copying levies), Mr Vitorino basically suggested eliminating private copying levies, notably for so
called “new business models in the digital environment”.

This represents a gross misconception of the private copying system. Practically, digital service
providers that offer e.g. a download service through a licence they receive from rightholders for that
download service are different than e.g. manufacturers of devices who are responsible for the
payment of the levies (which they will pass on to consumers, who are actually making private copies)
for the subsequent private copies of those downloads that are made by consumers. Therefore, what
is licensed by a service is different from what is subject to private copy levies. Licensed services
receive an authorisation for the exploitation of works based on the specificities of each business
model, while the remuneration for private copying is organised through the levy-based system to
guarantee that consumers are able to make private copies (as an exception to copyright), whatever
the service’s business model is. The CJEU in VG Wort also clearly dismissed Mr Vitorino’s analysis in
this respect by ruling that:xi

“Where a Member State has decided, pursuant to a provision in Article 5(2) and (3) of Directive
2001/29, to exclude, from the material scope of that provision, any right for the rightholders to
authorise reproduction of their protected works or other subject-matter, any authorising act the
rightholders may adopt is devoid of legal effects under the law of that State. Consequently, such an
act has no effect on the harm caused to the rightholders due to the introduction of the relevant
measure depriving them of that right, and cannot therefore have any bearing on the fair
compensation owed, whether it is provided for on a compulsory or an optional basis, under the
relevant provision of that directive.”

58
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          47
Licensing is seen [by Mr Vitorino] as a way of eradicating private copying levies, which is contrary to
the model applied today in most EU countries where the systems are complementary. By adopting
such a position, Mr Vitorino –and this questionnaire by suggesting such a solution - goes back in time
to when the very principle of the private copying exception in the digital era was challenged by those
who called for the implementation of technical protection measures (TPM) instead. This was not the
solution ultimately chosen in Europe under the 2001 Copyright Directive.

Such a proposition would:

   deprive consumers of their ability to legally make copies for private purposes unless such
    copies have been authorised by rightholders;
   involve the re-introduction of technological protection measures which consumers have
    massively rejected in the past. Here again the CJEU recently ruled that the possibility of
    applying technological measures does not necessarily mean that the private copying
    remuneration is not applicable;xii
   require to negotiate the remuneration for private copying (which normally falls under an
    “exception” that cannot be negotiated) in the purchase price of the digital content, compelling
    the rightholders to very difficult negotiations with companies benefitting from a huge
    bargaining power and leading to an increase of the prices to the detriment of consumers. In
    any case, higher prices are difficult to achieve because of the availability of content illegally
    online, for free.


66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]

GESAC considers that private copying remuneration schemes are fully compatible with the
development of new business models, products and services related to digital content. The
emergence of new business models, as well as of the consumer devices, has exponentially grown
over the past years, without being affected by private copying remuneration schemes.

The market penetration of new devices and services, such as smart phones, tablets, cloud, etc. has
not been prevented by the existence of private copying remuneration schemes. On the contrary,
those markets have grown exponentially over the last years. A recent study on the economic effects
of private copying levies indicates that, if the private copying remuneration is removed, device
manufacturers’ revenues would also decrease in the long term since the incentive to invest in new
content would fall.xiii Indeed, the private copying compensation is an essential part of the copyright
income for authors and composers derived from the digital market. The private copying
remuneration represents on average 5% of the European authors’ revenues, although with notable
differences between countries. In France, one of the most important markets, revenues deriving
from private copying in 2011 amounted up to 192,4 million EUR, around 43% of which was for
authors (e.g. for music, audiovisual, visual art, literary authors). This means more works, jobs and
growth for the whole creative chain in Europe.

Cloud services are various and they are not homogeneous. It is therefore necessary to analyse these
services on a case-by-case basis before determining the legal regime applicable to them.


                                                                                                    48
Furthermore, as new services emerge daily in the digital environment, labelling them as being
subject to private copying levies or not, just because of the technology they use, would be restrictive
and inaccurate. These offers need to be assessed carefully according to the function and the service
they deliver in each case (e.g. cloud-based download services are different than pure streaming
services, or a dumb cyber-locker service would be subject to levy if its functionality is limited to
storage of private copies). Moreover, as a principle, whether a service involves private copying
possibilities subject to fair compensation is a consideration to be made at the time of determining
the amount of levies on a certain device and not likely to impact the emergence or development of
that new service itself.

Moreover GESAC believes that the underlying principle for the application of private copying levies to
new services needs to be assessed according to the applicable law in a given Member State. In the
UK, for instance, currently there is no private copying exception and no compensation provided for.
As long as there is no exception with compensation provided by the law, rightholders should be able
to license those copies through their exclusive rights.

Member States where private copying compensation is provided should extend the scope of levies to
the services that allow individual consumers to copy their copyright content for private purposes on
their devices. In this respect, the CJEU in its Padawan ruling several times mentions that private
copying could be made not only by “digital reproduction equipment, devices and media but also by
copying services”.xiv Depriving authors and composers from this income would seriously harm their
earnings and would take away one of their well-established direct revenue streams on the basis of ill-
founded assumptions.

67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?59


GESAC totally agrees with the objective but does not believe that this technical point requires a
legislative change at EU level within the InfoSoc Directive. This is certainly not a big problem in
terms of cross-border application of levies; in fact, it is already applied in some Member States and
its application can easily be extended to all Member States with the agreement of all stakeholders
involved.

Visibility through giving information to consumers about the amount that is paid as private copying
compensation is one of the key elements to achieve trust and clarity in the market. Moreover this is
also a crucial issue in terms of transparency in how the levies are applied, who has paid what and
how the refund schemes could efficiently be processed.

GESAC believes that applied levy tariffs should be separately indicated on all invoices and contracts
throughout the supply chain and on final consumers' invoices and/or receipts.

The final consumer should also be adequately informed of the purpose of the applicable copyright
exception and of the levy. Such provisions, already implemented now in some EU Member States
(see France), should be extended at EU level.

However, this is a purely technical matter that does not justify on its own the reopening of the
InfoSoc Directive.

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          49
Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments60.

68.     Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
70.     Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?
71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?

Please find below GESAC’s views on this section and answers to the Questions 68 to 71.


     1) As pointed out in answer to question 64 above the CJEU has already clarified all these
        issues in its recent judgments and GESAC members have made the necessary arrangements
        to comply with the rulings of the Court. As long as the rulings of the Court are followed
        there is no need for any further legislative ‘clarification’ at EU level.
     2) The Commission, however, should focus its efforts more on stopping the worrying
        situations in Spain and the UK that are in contradiction with EU law.

The Spanish law, which entered into force in 2012, and the following legislative and administrative
actions taken by the Spanish government are clearly against the principle of providing the
rightholders with a “fair compensation”. It also deviates from the basic principle that such
compensation is to be paid by those who make the actual copies and, which is, for the ease of its
application, to be collected from the manufacturers and distributors of the recording devices that are
subject to levies (please see our answer to question 64 for the relevant CJEU rulings).

The UK government proposed a private copying exception without any fair compensation, which is
totally in contradiction with the provision of the InfoSoc Directive and the above-mentioned rulings
of the CJEU.

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          50
     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers61 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract62. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?

GESAC would like to give its general views on this section, instead of answering the specific
questions.


Whether for offline or online exploitations, collective management is the best solution to strike a
balance between ease of rights clearance, legal certainty and adequate remuneration for authors
and composers.

Authors’ societies grew out of the need for authors to join forces if they were to control the
exploitation of their works and to negotiate fair terms of remuneration with users which their weak
bargaining position as individuals would have prevented them from obtaining.

For many reasons, the individual author is rarely able to enforce his/her rights effectively without
his/her authors’ society:

          the increasingly diverse ways of using works makes it difficult and illusory for an author to
           exert personal control over the use made of his works

          even with today’s technologies, authors cannot learn how to manage the efficient
           exploitation of their rights across all different media around the world overnight, not all can
           afford the relevant investment;

61
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
62
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                                       51
          it is also manifestly clear that the individual author stands in a weak bargaining position
           compared to increasingly economically powerful users. If they are not to be deprived of their
           rightful remuneration, authors must rely on institutions which they can trust to manage their
           rights for them

          collective management offers high standards in terms of transparency and accountability and
           the individual author is ensured to have his/her rights managed on a non-discriminatory
           basis. In this respect, the recent CRM Directive provides high standards for governance and
           rights management, for the benefit of authors and composers.

Authors’ societies play a vital role in ensuring that authors are paid the royalties they are entitled to,
by defending their interests, engaging in negotiations with users, monitoring exploitations, and
collecting and adequately distributing royalties to their members and, through their sister societies,
to foreign rights holders.

It is essential, for authors’ societies to effectively protect the rights and interest of their members in
dealings with important and powerful third parties, that they received an exclusive assignment of
rights from their members. It is the only way to prevent individual rightholders being pressured into
disadvantageous agreements.

It is also to be noted that current contractual arrangements in audiovisual sector pose significant
problems for audiovisual authors, since de facto or de jure the producers of audiovisual works are
presumed to hold all the rights in audiovisual productions. Moreover, after transferring their rights to
producers, audiovisual authors are in most cases deprived from receiving any further royalties for the
making available to public of their works. Therefore, clear recognition of the making available rights
of the audiovisual authors and effective exercise of these rights through a fair remuneration (an
unwaivable remuneration to be managed by authors’ societies) for subsequent usages of their works,
even after the grant of their rights to audiovisual producers, need to be guaranteed.


     VI.      Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE63 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text64. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose65. One means to do this could be to clarify the role


63
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
64
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
65
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

                                                                                                           52
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure66. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Please find below GESAC’s general views on this section relating the “Respect for rights”


GESAC believes that respect for rights and the enforcement of rights are as important as the scope
and definition of the rights themselves. It is however concerned with some of the propositions made
by the Commission in the introduction to this section and within the questions.

GESAC believes that stating first that “one means to deal with the issue could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure” while excluding any debate on the liability regime provided by
the E-Commerce Directive is incomprehensible. In order to clarify the role of any intermediary to
ensure higher level of respect for rights, the safe harbour regime provided by the E-Commerce
Directive needs to be re-considered for copyright related activities.

GESAC would also like to underline that using the word “commercial” and trying to give a certain
definition as a criterion for enforcement is not a productive approach. In a rapidly changing internet
environment it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine which acts have commercial
relevance and for whom. Moreover, leaving all “non-commercial” acts, whatever it would mean,
outside of protection would not comply with the respect for the exclusive rights provided by EU law
and international treaties.


     VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.




66
  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                         53
78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?


GESAC is of the opinion that there is no need for the complete harmonisation of copyright in the
EU by means of a comprehensive copyright code because, basically, the existing EU legislative acts
already ensure a high standard of copyright protection.

The Commission argued in its previous policy papers that profound harmonisation of copyright and
the creation of a European copyright title with instant Community-wide effects, which could co-exist
with national copyright titles, could address the issues that it identified as a problem at the time.
Those problems were mainly related to multi-territorial licensing of copyrighted works. As we
pointed out in our answers to above questions multi-territorial licensing of rights is readily available
and being more widely developed both thanks to various industry initiatives and the Commission’s
recent initiatives, such as the CRM Directive and Licences for Europe.

The questions 78 and 79 of this consultation mentions the European Copyright Title, this time,
without necessarily referring to ‘multi-territorial licensing’ but “as a means of establishing a
consistent framework” and “the next step in the development of copyright in the EU”.

As regards the ‘consistent framework’, it is widely recognised and also mentioned several times in
the DeWolf Study that the rights provided by copyright are to a great extent harmonised at EU level.
They also follow in most instances the EU’s international obligation under copyright treaties.

It has also to be mentioned that the use of the expression “copyright title” seems to imply some sort
of formality in order to exercise the rights associated with it, such as it is the case for patents.
However, as regards copyright, such principle would be contrary to article 5.2 of the Berne
Convention, which provides that copyright protection is granted without any formality.

Moreover, it is our understanding that there is a heated debate as to whether Article 118 TFEU
provides a sufficient legal basis for such an initiative. Many people think that the way this article has
been drafted seems to imply that it is a provision limited to patents and trademarks, and that other
forms of intellectual property rights would be excluded. In our view, Art. 118 TFEU is not designed for
the introduction of a unitary copyright title. Paragraph (1) provides for authorisation regimes and
paragraph (2) provides for the decision making on language regime. It follows from this wording that
the entire provision offers a legal ground for industrial property protection only and not for a
copyright title. Copyright protection does exist autonomously without any authorization and the
language regime cannot be construed in this regard.

Apart from this, there is also no apparent benefit for the licensee. Digital service providers require a
number of rights for the operation of their platform. The question of rights clearance is therefore
paramount. A unitary copyright title, however, does not promote the necessary aggregation of the
rights and thus does not contribute to a system of “one-stop shop” licensing. All that this would
amount to is that the same legislation would be applicable to the different rights owners and this
only if all rights owners had opted for protection under the “single title”.



                                                                                                      54
Considering all these aspects, we wonder how such a proposal can be envisaged as “the next step in
the development of copyright in the EU”. Nevertheless we welcome the intention of the Commission
to take further steps in the development of copyright in the EU and we refer to our answer to
question 80 below to invite the Commission to take the necessary measures to address European
creators concerns as a priority in its copyright policy.


VIII.      Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.


CMOs respond to users’ requests and strive to find contractual solutions to adapt licensing solutions
to the needs of the market in order to enable and promote the development of innovative services
to the benefit of consumers and the European culture as well as the European economy.

The process of reopening the directive will create uncertainty which has a chilling effect on
businesses and creative and cultural industries. If the EU is focussed on growth and the completion of
the single market, then it would be counterproductive to set up that very uncertainty at the heart of
the digital copyright environment.

If GESAC answered this consultation, it is therefore only so that its observations are taken into
account in the event the Commission were to decide to reopen the Directive in spite of the many
difficulties that this would entail and the ensuing risks for rightholders.

Should such a reopening occur, GESAC must add that the Commission could not overlook the real
issue that needs to be addressed which is highly detrimental to rightholders.

As briefly mentioned in our answers to some of the questions above, the real problem to which the
review or modernisation of copyright should find a solution is adequate remuneration of creators in
the digital environment. Although the services, options and technologies that enable the public in
general to access and to enjoy creative works multiply every day, earnings of individual creators still
decrease. The value generated by digital technologies that owe their success mostly to access to
creative works is not fairly shared with the creators of those works. There is a transfer of value in
favour of technical intermediaries in the online environment and adequate remuneration of authors
and composers in particular, and all rightholders in general, for the use of their works on digital
platforms is not secured. The digital exploitation involves its own players - host providers, access
providers, search engines, etc. which generate high revenues thanks to the use of copyright
protected works and demand of consumers for ‘broader’-bands to use creative works.

The activity of many of these service providers is not limited to a mere conduit or stocking of
information: they are designed to make content available, organise the means they put at the
public’s disposal to access such content, develop special search engines, develop software to enable
consumers to view and listen to the content, seek to develop the widest audience possible and seek
to valorise the access given to protected content through advertising strategies. These intermediaries

                                                                                                    55
carry out acts of reproduction and/or of communication to the public for which they would be
considered liable if they did not benefit from the “safe harbour regime” under the E-commerce
Directive.

Those Internet intermediaries, who are harvesting the benefits of consumers’ wider access demand
that the creative content generates, are not responsible for the content that is trafficked/circulated
on their networks and platforms on the basis of the safe harbour regime set up by the E-commerce
Directive. Therefore they do not accept most licensing requests and show reluctance in enforcing or
monetising the content on their networks.

All around the world the rightholders are trying to establish the responsibility of these Internet
intermediaries, through court proceedings. The Commission also tried to establish working groups to
find voluntary industry initiatives but only for enforcement purposes. However most of the efforts
have so far had unsatisfactory results.

It is becoming more and more obvious that a regulatory initiative would be needed to ensure the
balance for the value generated from the use of creative works. The requirement to make the
necessary changes to the provisions of the E-Commerce Directive is also mentioned in the DeWolf
Study. We are aware of the fact that the Commission adamantly opposes opening of E-Commerce
Directive for various reasons. We also believe that E-Commerce Directive is a horizontal directive that
has an impact on many important principles such as net neutrality, privacy, freedom of expression,
etc. And opening that directive only for this specific purpose could have undesirable consequences in
terms of other rights.

GESAC, therefore, believes that the current debate on modernisation of copyright would be an
appropriate opportunity to underline this fundamental problem that the creative sector is facing.
Tackling this would allow a wider modernisation of the European policy applicable to digital economy
by providing more legal certainty for the citizens when engaging with creative content online,
flourishing of new legitimate online services within a more secure framework and more adequate
remuneration of rightholders for the use of their works in digital era.

GESAC invites the Commission to look at this issue much more carefully; since this is the most
important reason why the adequate remuneration of rightholders cannot be ensured and wider
availability of legitimate online services cannot be achieved.
