          You need copyright to sustain your investment, tell the EC!




* Context of this consultation

The European Commission has launched a very important consultation on EU Copyright rules in the framework of a larger political debate on the need to reform copyright to make it fit for today's time. It is very important that the voice of publishers is heard as there is a lot of pressure for a wide reform copyright, which would be very detrimental to publishers and their authors. We hear a lot of unfounded myths and claimed uses that are supposedly not solvable by your licences, and you need to explain the Commission in a positive way what you do and give examples. 
Try to give as much impact that some options put forward can have on your costs, opportunities and revenues and do not forget to mention who you are and how many staff you represent. 
As a European trade association, we encourage all European book and learned journals publishers to answer the questionnaire and have therefore facilitated your efforts by creating a shorter version of the consultation with the most relevant questions and suggestion of answers reflecting the position of the publishers. Of course, feel free to answer whatever you feel is appropriate. 
This document is an explanations on the questions. It refers to the questions of the consultation and the page number of our suggested answers, not the original document.
Please note that a longer version has been distributed to your national associations, you can ask them for it if you are interested and go there for the full consultation or use this online questionnaire: http://www.rightsholderseucopyright.co.uk
There will be a big debate at very high level end of March and this questionnaire will nourish the debate. So far, a lot of civil society and "consumers" answered in mass, we need you!
You can answer in any language. 
Deadline to answer: 5 February. 









* Explanations on some questions



I.	Access to your content across Europe

* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  

Question 1 ; 3 and 7 (page 1 to 3)
* Explanations: There is a lot of prejudice on this and people tend to think that it is the publishers who are disabling the possibility of accessing e-books from abroad. Explain how publishers usually always have worldwide contracts and that restrictions when they happen have nothing to do with copyright. 

Question 4: Download to own digital content (page 3)

Explanations: there is a lot of pressure to apply the "rule of exhaustion" to digital content, so your e-books. This would have the most catastrophic consequence as it will mean that once a e-book is legally accessed, it can be forwarded, given, lend or sold. There is a reason why current copyright law does not allow exhaustion on e-books and other digital content and we should make it clear.
III. 	Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Explanations: The following questions are essential for publishers as they question the current legal framework that limits your exclusive right on a work and should be balanced. The challenge is to show that publishers are licensing new uses and that new exceptions and limitations should not be introduced as long as they are no proven market failure. 
* Access to content in libraries and archives
* Preservation and archiving: Question 28 (b) (page 5)
Explanations: The preservation of the copies of your works held in the collections of libraries is justified in certain type of libraries, the heritage libraries. There are complaints by librarians that this exceptions is not the same everywhere across Europe. However, we believe we do not need to create new exceptions and voluntary agreements have already been reached at EU level.
* Off-premises access to library collections: Question 32 (c) (page 5)
Explanations: Current European Copyright law allows people to go into libraries and to consult digital content, including e-books on dedicated terminals. 
* E-lending: Question 36 (c) (page 5)
Explanations: Libraries want to increasingly lend e-books to their readers. Technologies have improved. However, we do not believe that the current exception in the law for public lending should be extended to libraries, which is what they want. We have to show we favour licensing options as we need to preserve the commercial market. 

Teaching
Question 42 (b) and  44 (Page 6)

Explanations: Most of the countries have an exception allowing for teachers to use your works in the classroom (except for school materials in some countries which are excluded). However, there are pressure to open this to white boards, the online and go across-border. 
Research
Question 47 (b) and 49 (page 6-7)

Explanations: Most of the countries have an exception allowing researchers to use your works for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The Commission seeks to know whether this requires changes.
Disabilities 
Question 50 (c) and 52 (page 7)

Explanations: Most of the countries have an exception to allow organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. A new international treaty in Marrakesh was adopted in June 2013 to allow the cross-border exchange of files. But publishers are also increasingly committed in publishing their work in accessible formats thanks to e-pub3.
Text and data mining
Question 53 (c), 55 and 57 (page 8)

Explanations: Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are new buzz terms with the Commission. If you are a STM publisher, show whether you have licences that gives access to your subscribers for Text and Data Mine purpose and show that you are supporting allowing your subscribers for non-commercial research to TDM when the request is genuine and honest. 
User-generated content
Question 58 (c) and 59
Explanations: We do not see much application of UGC (User Generated content) in the field of publishing. For us, it is more a problem for music and film industries, as publishers' content when used is usually falling under quotation or it is plagiarism. 
IV.	 Fair remuneration of authors and performers

Question 73 (page 9)

Explanations: Some groups of authors, mostly in the audiovisual, as well as performers are asking for a EU law to give them a remuneration right. We explained the Commission that the way publishing works, we almost always associate our authors to the success of their books through royalties and therefore do not have the same problems. We are aware authors are lobbying for forbidding at EU level "abusive clauses" publishers may impose in their contract, but this is something that is difficult to decide at EU level. 

V. 	Respect for rights

Question 75, 76 and 77 (page 9-10)

Explanations: There has been one directive created in 2004 to ensure respect of your rights. This has become very political and the Commission fears to re-open this Directive. However, we should voice our practical concerns we have as publishers.
