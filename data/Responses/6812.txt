  ……………………………………………………………………………………………….


   1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
       trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
       which you live?
 NO – The Creators’ Rights Alliance has experienced no such problems, nor have
member organisations reported any to us.
   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
       seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
 NO – The Creators’ Rights Alliance has experienced no such problems, nor have
member organisations reported any to us.
   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
      How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if
      possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
      Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.
The Creators’ Rights Alliance does not grant licences. It campaigns to preserve the
exclusive right of creators – authors and performers – to grant licences, on fair terms.
The CRA has many reports of publishers and broadcasters putting pressure on creators to
grant multi-territorial licences for no greater fee than has until now been paid for a single
territory.
For certain classes of creator – in particular journalists, authors of “trade books” and
performers who retain “residual” rights in film and television productions – the ability to
negotiate a further licence for extra territories is an important source of the income that
sustains them as dedicated professionals constantly seeking to improve their creativity.
The CRA is concerned that a specific concern in one sector – which we understand
originally to been that of online and wireless service providers licensing music for mobile
devices – risks derailing the entire debate around how individual creativity is supported in
the EU. The question, as put, suggests a confusion of issues at different stages in the
licensing chain from creator to consumer.
   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
      what would be the best way to tackle them?
The solution to the problems mentioned above lies in fair contract law: see Q 72.


   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
       Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for
       all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
       impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
       ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
       countries)?
 YES: As described above, for certain classes of creator – in particular journalists,
authors of “trade books” and performers who retain “residual” rights in film and television

                                                                                            2
    productions – the ability to negotiate a further licence for extra territories is an important
    source of the income that sustains them as dedicated professionals constantly seeking to
    improve their creativity.
    For text authors in particular, there are also issues of legal liability, outside of Authors’
    Rights law. To take a deliberately crass example: from 1967 to 2009 it was unclear
    whether it was legal to put on a stage production of The Producers in the Federal Republic
    of Germany, since the prohibition on display of certain insignia contains, as far as we can
    tell, no exception for irony. It may be that the 2009 production at the Admiralspalast
    Theater was merely tolerated.
    Creators may, for this and other reasons, have reasons to require territorial licensing that
    go well beyond Authors’ Rights law. Journalists have special concerns, on which our
    member organisation the National Union of Journalists will expand.
       6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
           why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
           territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
           territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the
           consumer to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
     YES, in some circumstances, publishers, service providers and even collecting societies
    will need to make use of territoriality for reasons analogous to those outlined under
    Question 5 above.
       7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
           market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
           availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
           level of protection for right holders?
     NO: the current legal system does not prevent authors from making their work available
    across borders. We will address concerns regarding abusive contractual clauses and
    compensation for using authors’ rights under question 72.
       8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
           content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES.
       9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
           scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your
           rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
           considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on
           the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief1)?
     NO: No clarification is needed of the making-available right. The issue that CRA
    members face is ensuring that exploitation of these rights must be made clear in
    negotiations over licensing, and that adequate remuneration is paid for these exploitations.
    See our response to Question 72.



1
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                   3
   10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of
      two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g.
      a download) create problems for you?
 NO: The Creators’ Rights Alliance is not aware of any problems caused by failure to
licence both rights to a publisher or broadcaster to the extent necessary for the
exploitation of the work. The problem of which we are acutely aware is ensuring that
individual creators receive adequate remuneration for that use.


   11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
       protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
       subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – in certain special circumstances: Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/29 provides
that authors have the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit reproduction, in whole or in
part, of their works. In the Infopaq case (C-5/08) the CJEU decided that “an act occurring
during a data capture process, which consists of storing an extract of a protected work
comprising 11 words and printing out that extract, is such as to come within the concept
of reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC”.
It is, however, important to draw a distinction between (A) links such as those that appear
on a newspaper web page, linking to content prepared by a journalist working for this web
site (an “internal link”), for which authorisation is not needed because it is part of the
normal exploitation of that web site and secured in a contract or a collective agreement,
and (B) “external links” to content on another web site.
There are, further, different cases of “external links”. Permission should not be required,
for example, for links which are of the nature of a citation and which do not have a distinct
economic function or value and do not affect the normal exploitation of the work linked
to. It is not entirely clear, even given recent jurisprudence, whether such links are the
concern of authors’ rights law. Guidance to the courts in deciding this issue can be offered
by analogy to the “three-step test” setting out in the WTO TRIPS Agreement the
boundaries of exceptions to authors’ rights, and in the exceptions in the InfoSoc directive.
Does the link:
      (a) go to a work which has not been genuinely made available to the public
(genuinely so – accidental failure to secure a pre-publication page, for example, should not
count)?
      (b) affect the normal exploitation of the work linked to? or
      (c) fail to offer sufficient attribution, in the circumstances, to the work linked to?
If the answer to any of the above is “yes” then the link requires permission – as found by
the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in its ruling on the large collections of links
considered in Meltwater. In addition, any linking that attempts to “pass off” another’s work
as that of the person making the link is of course infringing, and likely to be a breach of the
moral rights of the author of the linked work.
Yet further, the courts will need to take care when presented with cases that involve links
from one website to another which is technically separate but effectively under the control
of the linker or providing the same service. This is to say that the concept of “a link” is not
as obvious as it may at first appear.


                                                                                               4
      12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction
          of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
          the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
          circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 NO: Temporary acts of reproduction which are an essential part of a technological
process for the purpose of lawful permitted use fall under Article 5.1 of Directive
2001/29/EC.
Recital 33 of this Directive provides a very clear answer to this question, limiting this
exception to transient or incidental reproductions forming an integral and essential part of
a technological process and carried out for the sole purpose of enabling either efficient
transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary; or a lawful use of a
work or other subject matter to be made; with the further condition that such acts of
reproduction have no separate economic value. It is hard to see how this could be clearer.
      13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
         trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
 NO: See answer to Q 14.


      14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
          consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
          purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The principle of “exhaustion” is only relevant to hard copies of work and should not apply
to online services and online copies that will remain of perfect quality and never
deteriorate. This is in line with recital 29 of directive 2001/29 and there is no need to
amend this. Indeed, any attempt to apply the exhaustion principle to digital works would
result in an obvious reduction of income for authors who rely on the possibility to licence
their work to support themselves, and would thus go a long way toward restricting the
creation of new works to amateurs and those funded by patronage.
      15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
          and licensing of works and other subject matter?
 NO.


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
All possible advantages can equally by obtained by voluntary recording of rights in work
and adoption of standard identifiers.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
A work gains the protection of authors’ rights law by its very existence and this must not
be subject to any formality (article 5.2 Berne convention). In addition, in some sectors,
such as for example the news sector, authors often produce several stories or hundreds of


                                                                                               5
photographs a day: any requirement to register these works would impose an additional
burden for any professional and their employer.
Further, the role of authors’ rights law is not only to ensure income for professionals.
Amateur creators need its protection when their work becomes of financial value – for
example video of current events at which no professional crew was present. They also
need its protection when their works – for example blog postings – may be used in a
manner contrary to their honour or reputation – for example by a political party which
they abhor. Any requirement for registration would remove these essential protections
from citizens.
However, the European Commission could explore ways to support and encourage
standardised identifiers.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
None: see above.
      19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
          content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
          ownership and permissions databases?
Identifiers are crucial to the reduction of orphan works in circulation, in particular given
the ease of copying online uses without identifying information. While press articles are
frequently put online without specific identifiers, photographers usually incorporate a
specific tag to identify their works. Metadata incorporated in a photograph with sufficient
information about the author will enable the latter to track the uses of his/her work – so
long as it is not removed, which is regrettably often the case. Such rights management
metadata also allow users to find a specific photographer more easily.
The EU has a role to play in promoting the importance for authors to identify their work
and highlight the benefit that those identifications can have for users too.
Awareness-raising campaigns on the importance of protecting identifiers and effective
sanctions for their removal are also key.


      20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
          environment?
 YES: The justification for the term of protection being 70 years post mortem autorem is, if
anything, even stronger when works are available in the digital environment and may be
very widely reproduced at minimal cost, in perfect quality condition for an unlimited time.
The length of copyright protection is therefore justified to compensate authors and their
heirs for the income lost due to improved copying technologies in the digital environment.
      21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
          provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 NO: Authors’ rights’ legislation in EU member states reflect different traditions and
practices and this is particularly the case of exceptions and limitations.




                                                                                            6
Problems arise at national level when an exception is not fairly compensated or where
some authors are not adequately protected against certain unauthorised uses: but this is a
different issue.
The three-step-test in Berne and WTO TRIPS serves as a sound safeguard to ensure that
exceptions in national legislation do not unduly harm authors and impact their income.
   22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
       for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 NO: See above. The importance of providing fair compensation to authors for
exceptions and limitations is key to maintaining creators’ income. In particular Article 5 (2)
(b) should be enforced properly by ensuring that a fair compensation is paid in cases of
copies made for private uses. The same should apply to all exceptions and limitations that
member states decide to implement.


   23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
       existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO.
   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
       degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
       exceptions?
 NO: There is a wide and sufficient degree of flexibility at EU level. The need to
compensate authors for using their works under exceptions and limitations should be a
priority. Many online uses tend to compete with the normal exploitation of authors’ rights
and thus in practice infringe the three-step test.
   25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
       interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
       interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use
       or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would
       be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its
       possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
N/A.
   26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
       a problem?
 NO: See comments above.


   27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
       have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
       addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
       whom, where?)
The first user should pay the compensation. In the case of private copying for instance, it
should be the manufacturer.


                                                                                                 7
      28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
         problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
         or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
exception?
 NO.
29.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
N/A
      30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
          elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
          under which conditions?
N/A
      31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
N/A
      32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
          problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
          to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
          thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-
matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries
when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of
research and private study?
Collecting societies negotiate this directly on behalf of authors. The creators we represent
would not enter these contracts individually.
      33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Solutions can be found within the sector by involving all parties at stake. The
Memorandum of Understanding on Key principles on the digitisation and making available
of –out –of-commerce works is a good example of this.
      34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
          elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
          under which conditions?
N/A
      35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
N/A

                                                                                             8
   36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
       when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
       including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
 NO.
   37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
N/A
   38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
       management of physical and online collections, including providing access to
       your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
N/A
   39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
       libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending
       and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-
       lending? What problems have you encountered?
Recital 2 of Directive 2006/115/EC on rental and lending right points out that the rental
and lending of authors’ copyright works play an increasingly important role.
Recital 4 also suggests that copyright and related rights protection must adapt to new
economic developments such as new forms of exploitation. On this basis, electronic
lending processes have different effects on the economic interests of authors and
performers to those known for rental procedures adopted in the analogue environment.
For example, the ease of making perfect copies and the ubiquity of “cracks” for copy-
protection schemes, together make “electronic lending” a major conduit of works into
piracy operations, many of which are income-generating for their perpetrators.
The second-hand sale or rental or lending of a physical book or other work after its first
sale might not be of great interest to the author: but the electronic lending of digital
content of excellent quality may very well have a significant impact on the business model
of publishing and the sustainability of high-quality professional creation. Electronic access to
an author’s work including by way of electronic renting must therefore remain subject to
his/her consent.
Thus electronic “lending” does not meet the criteria for exceptions set out in the three-
step test.
   40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
      mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
      Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
      results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
      collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can
      be accessed across the EU?

                                                                                               9
Note: The signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out-of-commerce works agreed to call “on the
European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border
context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted to ensure that publicly accessible
cultural institutions and collective management organisations which enter into a licence in
good faith applying these key principles are legally protected with regard to licensed uses
of works of rightholders who have been presumed to be within the scope of the licence.”
   41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
       other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
       archives)?
 YES: It would be useful to explore industry-led solutions in these sectors, the
development of which must include all relevant stakeholders.
   42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
      you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-
      matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration
for teaching, including across borders?
 NO: The implementation of article 5(3)(a) must meet the objective of permitting
illustration for teaching purposes and should not overtake overreach this purpose. In
particular, the non-commercial aspect of this exception is important in order not to
compete with creators’ activities and right to syndicate their work.
   43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The public’s perception of the legitimacy of an exception including compensation will occur
when they are confident that a fair share of this compensation is distributed to the
creators of the works. Problems can occur when creators do receive no remuneration for
the use of their work for illustration for teaching. This can be the case when they are
forced to sign away their exclusive rights to their employers.
It would be useful to raise awareness that the scope of exception 5(3)(a): is illustration for
teaching or scientific research only; that it specifies the need to include acknowledgement
of the source and of the authors’ names; and that is is for non-commercial purposes only.
This means that the exception does not grant the user a licence to make available,
reproduce, distribute, broadcast an entire work (whether print, audiovisual or
photographic).
   44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
       illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Unless they have assigned their exclusive rights to their employers or clients, creators
usually grant a licence to a collecting society to manage such rights and this would cover
the exception for teaching of illustration purposes.
   45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
       elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
       under what conditions?


                                                                                            10

   47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
       you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject
       matter in the context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
 NO: Creative works must be accessible for research as long as the source is mentioned
– including authors’ names – and the restriction to non-commercial purposes of the
activity are respected. Collecting societies are responsible for licensing these uses on
creators’ behalf – where they have not been pressured to assign their exclusive rights to
their employers or clients.
   48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
See our response to question 43
   49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
       research purposes? How successful are they?
Publishers insist that they are willing to licence material. Some collecting societies offer
online platforms to enable access to works usually included in newspapers or magazines.
However, it is difficult to trace the remuneration that is paid to creators via these
platforms.
   50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation
      representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with
      accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States’
      implementation of this exception?
N/A
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with
disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works
published in special formats across the EU?
N/A
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
 YES: It is vital to increase the availability of special format copies of textual works for
persons with print disabilities whilst respecting authors’ rights. Any use of a work must
also ensure that the author is compensated for the use of his/her work. Authors are too


                                                                                           11
often forced to sign away their exclusive rights. This means that no remuneration is paid to
them in return.
   51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
See Q 52 below.
   52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
       How successful are they?
An interesting feature of the digital distribution of works is that the ideal data format
facilitates accessibility: for examples video is distributed to all with subtitles and properly-
marked-up textual works can easily be read aloud by machines.
In essence, the version of new works best suited to people with sight or hearing difficulties
is the same as the highest-quality work for the general market.
The issue, then, is not that authors’ rights pose an obstacle, but that distributors do not
take full advantage of the technology. This situation could be ameliorated by, for example,
making tax credits conditional on the presence of, for example, audio description tracks
and subtitles on audio-visual works.
Another issue is that people with sight or hearing difficulties do not have full access to the
labour market to afford to pay for works in the normal manner. We leave solving this as
an exercise for the reader.
   53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
      you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data
      mining methods, including across borders?
N/A
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including
across borders?
N/A
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
 NO: The use of information and data from outside sources is part of the normal work of
authors. It falls under the quotation exception or requires consent from the author if the
use is significant and would amount to an act of reproduction.

This space left intentionally nearly blank.
   55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main

   57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
       text or data mining methods?
There are many, but the most interesting lie on the three-way boundary between
information theory, public understanding of statistical results and epistemology – and are
out of scope for this consultation.
   58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
      problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
      disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-
matter through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting
from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to
disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?
 Yes, if the question is understood to include the issues about contracts being imposed
on creators.
   59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
       experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on
       the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are
       proprietary systems sufficient in this context?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
 YES: A notable example is the too-frequent use of photographs online for UGC
purposes without any authorisation of the photographer.
More economically significant is the practice of some newspaper publishers of taking
photographs from online sources – including those that are “UGC” some senses of the
term – and using them for profit. This has happened both with amateur photographs and
with samples posted by professionals and semi-professionals.
Analogous issues arise in other fields of creativity.
Too often, rights-management metadata is removed from photographs, thus impeding the
identification of the author and making it difficult for further would-be users to seek
permission to use his/her work.
   60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
       experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you
       have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?

users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?

       64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
           the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the digital environment?
     NO: The prevalence of devices which enable or host private copies has grown
    exponentially, as have their storage capacities. It is not necessary to change the law but it is
    important to ensure that the private copy exception also applies in the digital environment
    including copies “in the cloud”, then remuneration must be collected therefrom.
       65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
           a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
           rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?3
     YES: The CJEU ruling VG Wort (C-457/11 to C-460/11)4 clarified that the fact that
    rightholders have expressly or implicitly authorised the reproduction of their protected
    work or other subject-matter and the possibility of applying technical protection measures
    (TPMs) have no bearing on the fair compensation owed.
    In its ruling in Padawan (C-467/08) the CJEU made clear that levies should be calculated
    according to the assumed harm sustained by rightholders by the private copying in
    question. In addition it stressed that whereas the harm of an individual copy might be
    limited, the harm caused by millions of copies is considerable.
       66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
           (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
           copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
           business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

    Consumers make more copies than ever before on devices that are interconnected and
    increasingly on those that store copies “in the cloud”. Unless private coping compensation
    is paid to compensate creators for these new uses of their work, creators’ revenue will
    necessarily suffer. Moreover, a licence would not ensure that authors are compensated in
    any form, while a levy collected by a collecting society that is duly representative of
    authors will ensure that.
       67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
          products subject to levies?5
     YES: The need for transparency is important in order not to mislead consumers and to
    inform them of the amount collected and the destination of this compensation. Private
    copying levies should be made clearly visible on all invoices and contracts in the products’
    sales chain, including on consumers’ invoices and till receipts.


       68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
           undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to
           the free movement of goods or services?
     NO OPINION
       69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
           persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those
           transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you
           provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
    No response.
       70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To
           what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
           existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
    No response.
       71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
           system, how would these problems best be solved?
    None identified.


       72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
           combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration
           for the exploitation of your works and performances?
    The 2013 UN report The right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity6 points to:
    “coercive contracts that authors and artists identify as a primary obstacle to fair
    remuneration. Under such contracts, which are frequent, creators sign away all their rights
    to their creation in order to gain a commission for creating a work. Consequently, they
    lose control over their creation, which can be used in contradiction to their own vision”.

Collective agreements are in many or most sectors the best way to set minimum terms
for primary use (understood as first publication or broadcast); for further primary use such
as publication in another title or “syndication” sale to another newspaper; and for
secondary uses (archiving, copying, some rebroadcasting) of their works.
These agreement should be combined with the work done by collecting societies which
should be democratically representative of creators, to collect remuneration for other
secondary uses such as private copying, reprography, virtual learning environments and
lending.
Collective agreements should also include freelance creators who are considered in many
member states’ legal systems to be “entrepreneurs” with no possibility to act collectively.
Further, these freelances are particularly vulnerable to being forced to assign their
exclusive rights for a lump sum, independent of the futures uses that can be made of their
works.
Section 32 of the German Copyright Act provides a sound basis for revising contracts that
are deemed to be inequitable.
The Creators’ Rights Alliance stands ready to discuss these issues and solutions to them
with the Commission in more detail.
   73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
       contracts)?
 YES: A number of classes of unfair contract clauses should be prohibited in EU
legislation in order to compensate for the uneven bargaining situation that creators have to
face and to provide the conditions for a genuinely cross-border market for creators’
works. Examples include:
¶ clauses that assign rights in future works for unknown uses;
¶ “buy-out” clauses (lump sumps for the transfer of exclusive rights for an indefinite time);
¶ clauses allowing for waiver of moral rights; and
¶ clauses unreasonably restricting creators’ right to work in a similar sector.
   74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
       address the shortcomings you identify?
A key will be for the European Commission to start focusing on the contractual bargaining
power at stake in the creative sector. The stark imbalance of such power at present
prevents most authors from exercising any claim for additional remuneration for the use
of their works, due in particular to abusive clauses and rights transfer mechanisms
embedded in employment contracts.
Section 32 of the German Copyright Act (inserted by the Act of 2002) allows for review
of the contract when the remuneration received by the author is inequitable: this is a
sound basis for Community Action. This section has also permitted, for example, German
associations of journalists (DJU an DJV) and the Federation of German Newspaper
Publishers to agree on “joint remuneration rules for free journalists at daily newspapers”.
Another necessary area of action is to improve the functioning of Small Claims court
mechanisms to allow creators to pursue infringers without having to raise significant costs.
At present access to justice in cases of cross-border infringement is severely restricted,
and even if the existing meagre provisions are used the prospects for actually collecting any

                                                                                            16
court-ordered compensation are poor. The Creators’ Rights Alliance is prepared to
submit further material on this question if asked.
Further, professional associations and trade unions need to be able to initiate legal
proceedings against those who impose inequitable contracts. The present situation in
which a creator must take action on their own behalf deters access to justice, since many
have a thoroughly justified fear of being “blacklisted” if they do so.
   75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
       infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
See above.
   76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
       involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
       brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
       online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
       would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
Making it clear that such intermediaries are liable for contributing to infringement would
be a good start.
   77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
       achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
       as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
See Q 74 above.


   78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
       a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
       copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 NO: we consider that the amount of time and energy that would be consumed in such
an exercise would be far better directed to dealing with the issues of unfair contracts, the
weakness of access to justice for individual creators and the development of creativity
itself as the “raw material” for a flourishing creative economy.
   79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
       current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
       longer term project?
No: see above.


   80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
       copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
We’re exhausted.

Appendix: Creators’ Rights Alliance member organisations


The Creators’ Rights Alliance is an affiliation of organisations representing the interests of
over 100,000 original creators in a wide range of fields – including music, illustration,
journalism, photography and writing.


Most of these 100,000 creators make their living by licensing copyright and performers’
rights in their work. All are at times presented with contracts on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis:
the differences between the different sectors of creativity are minor and within sectors the
wording of the contracts tends to be suspiciously similar between clients.
