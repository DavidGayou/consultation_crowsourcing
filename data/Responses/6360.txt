   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


In universities and other  research  institutions  researchers  are  usually
granted access to copyrighted research material on the basis  of  individual
or institution (IP) based identification. For access to this content  across
borders solutions have been found. Some restrictions can  apply  to  content
such as that digitised under public-private partnership, however, these  are
more often due to national  content  control  than  copyright  issues.  More
problematic is access to  online  multimedia  content  such  as  broadcasts,
film, music and e-books, which  are  subject  to  regional  licence  control
mechanisms. Restrictions are many and  well  documented  (see  Licences  for
Europe), and are preventing researchers from accessing  relevant  linguistic
and cultural content.





€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).


Besides the  usual  production  and  marketing  costs,  a  content  provider
delivering content across border has to  take  into  account  the  so-called
localisation costs. They cover tasks such as translation and  adaptation  to
local consumer preferences. In  the  case  of  content  services  they  also
include the issuance costs(which amount is correlated with the diversity  of
legal  systems  in   regard   to   IPR,   consumer   protection,   technical
standardisation) and the cost of maintenance of service  (mainly  correlated
to IPR aspects such as the risk  of  litigation,  the  cost  to  defend  the
service  provided  against  copyright  infringements).  Due  to  these  IPR-
specific location costs a service provider may choose  not  to  serve  small
(in the sense of small revenue generating) markets.  This  puts  researchers
based in smaller European countries at a disadvantage  because  the  content
they require is not licenced for them to access from their country.





€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


Natural and guided industry convergence.  Harmonisation  of  applying  legal
and technical compliance regulation. Inequality of access to  content  could
also be addressed  if  libraries  were  able  to  provide  an  international
interlibrary e-lending service on  the  same  basis  as  that  provided  for
analog formats e.g. online document delivery for e-journal articles  and  e-
books.








   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


Licences for Europe has shown the willingness of service providers  to  make
a step towards harmonisation of  practices.  The  process  also  showed  the
limits inherent in self-commitment,  considering  that  cross-borders  issue
occur within the EU as much as between EU and third countries, making  clear
regulative action as well as agreements on a  multinational  (global)  level
necessary.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


1 [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


2 The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO


€ NO OPINION


3 Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

4 Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


Education, learning, teaching, not to mention the functioning of modern  day
society requires that hyperlinks remain free of  any  intellectual  property
rights. I believe it would run counter  to  all  the  economic,  social  and
educational interests of the Information Society  to  bring  URLs  into  the
scope of intellectual property laws. It would be entirely  disproportionate,
and harmful to the European knowledge economy if URLs  had  to  be  licenced
individually or collectively. Also creators of content and URLs, we  do  not
believe it is in the interest of Leiden University to put a further  barrier
in place to exposing our collections via aggregators such  as  Europeana  or
OpenAire. If the European Court of Justice (CJEU) were to rule  that  a  URL
could attract copyright we believe that the  Information  Society  Directive
would have to be amended to ensure that this  ruling  would  have  no  real-
world effect. I strongly believe that URLs, like facts and  data,  catalogue
and bibliographic records etc are  the  building  blocks  of  knowledge  and
information sharing and therefore must be freely  usable  and  shareable  by
anyone for any purpose.

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


This is an extremely important question and one that goes to  the  heart  of
whether a body of law that stretches back to 1709 to regulate  the  printing
press is fit for purpose in a world where computers,  servers,  kindles  etc
must copy in order for a person to simply access any type of  creative  work
– in-copyright or public domain. While we are of course very  aware  of  Art
5.(1) of the Information Society Directive I do  not  think  it  serves  any
purpose at all to regulate the simple fact that machines copy in  order  for
individuals to read, view, analyse or listen to something. I strongly  agree
with the report “Copyright Reform for Growth and Jobs”  that  the  right  of
reproduction, which is not defined in international treaties,  needs  to  be
more  closely  linked  to  the  economic  harm  that  is   the   result   of
communication to the public.

5 Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


It would mean that works would be easier to find,  reducing  the  number  of
orphan  works,  and  increasing  the  chance  that  creators  could  receive
financial and / or reputational benefit from the reuse of their  works.  ii)
It would facilitate authors / creators  to  take  action  against  copyright
infringement; iii) It would support  the  creative  economy  and  access  to
knowledge by differentiating between content that creators want  to  control
reuse of and works which people are not producing for  commercial  gain  and
could be freely reused by third parties for cultural and financial  benefit.
This is particularly pertinent as works get older, it becomes  difficult  to
find rightsholders,  and  works  fall  into  limbo  where  no  financial  or
reputational benefit accrues  to  the  creator.  (See  examples  below)  iv)
Registration could be simple and given that online life in the 21st  century
requires registration for many online services and is thus the norm,  it  is
no longer the barrier it was in the 19th century.  Registration  would  have
the triple benefit of reducing overheads  of  searching  for  rightsholders,
increasing the chance that works would be relicenced, and  thirdly  allowing
works that are not registered to be freely used by  third  parties.  A)  The
Term Directive 2011/77/EU was a significant lost  opportunity  for  creators
and licensors of sound recordings given that where works do revert there  is
no requirement for this information to be made public. If the Directive  had
included such a provision it  would  have  facilitated  the  relicensing  of
works, that currently are not being  licenced  in  any  significant  amount,
thus depriving the creator of reputational and / or  financial  benefit.  B)
Value exists not only  in  the  control  of  the  exclusive  rights  by  the
creator, but also in their  waiving  of  these  rights  and  allowing  third
parties to reuse their works while  still  in  copyright,  as  well  as  the
process of copyright works entering into the public domain. For example  one
2003 Library of Congress study comparing the EU and the US shows that  works
no longer subject to control by the  original  rightsholder  (in  this  case
because they were in the public domain here) meant that by a  ratio  of  two
to one there were more works available in the EU than the US . C)  It  is  a
well-known fact discussed many times in the  context  of  the  orphan  works
debates that as you go back further in time there are more orphan works  and
that more and more works fall  out  of  commerce.  Registration  could  help
alleviate this issue as it would create smoother  licensing  for  registered
works, and a body of content unregistered that could be reused in a  fashion
that it currently is not possible.








  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


The main issue would be establishing a technical  infrastructure  to  manage
this, and migrate it over time given the very long  duration  of  copyright.
Copyright works that creators want to assert copyright over, and  through  a
lack of knowledge do not register could be an issue. However given  that  in
the 21st century everyone who  writes  or  creates  online  is  a  copyright
holder whether they want to be or not, we may  have  more  people  who  want
their work to be freely used by others than those who want to reserve  their
copyright. This is particularly evident in  online  communities  and  within
the sciences.








  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


As in the US, rules could be  put  in  place  whereby  certain  elements  of
copyright  protection  are  only  available  to   rightsholders   who   have
registered their works. For example, registration might be  required  for  a
rightsholder to start an enforcement  action.  Another  incentive  might  be
that rightsholders need to register their works in order to be  eligible  to
collect royalties through collective rights management organisations.





How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


Our main concern is that identifiers be  based  on  open  standards  and  be
interoperable. The EU should encourage the adoption of  open  standards  and
foster interoperability.





Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


Whilst acknowledging copyright’s social, economic  and  cultural  functions,
we believe that the minimum terms of  protection  in  Europe  (currently  70
years) should be reduced. Experts repeatedly  point  out  that  the  current
term of protection is too long . The most  significant  argument  against  a
long term of protection is the erosion  of  the  public  domain.  As  it  is
stated in the Europeana  Public  Domain  Charter  ,  Having  a  healthy  and
thriving Public Domain is essential to the social  and  economic  well-being
of society. Public domain is vital not only for  librarians  and  researches
but also for  creators  and  artists  who,  for  centuries,  have  used  and
transferred works created by  their  predecessors.  Longer  copyright  terms
exacerbates the issue of orphan works,  which  are  created  when  copyright
owners cannot be found or identified. Only a small percentage  of  copyright
works created  for  commercial  gain  retain  ongoing  value  sufficient  to
justify long copyright terms. The EU Directive on  Orphan  Works  recognizes
the significance of the orphan works problem and I believe  that  a  reduced
term of protection for copyright works would greatly alleviate  this  issue.
The need to carry out a diligent  search  for  owners  of  orphan  works  is
putting too much strain on library resources  and  is  creating  a  cultural
black  hole  as  ‘orphaned’  content  cannot  be  used  by  the  public   or
researchers. This problem affects not only relatively old  publications  but
also the more recent materials. For instance the National Library in  Warsaw
estimates that about 300 000 books,  pictures  and  newspapers  including  a
huge collection of the clandestine literature from  Solidarity  and  Martial
law period is orphaned. The term of protection should  be  brought  in  line
with the minimum terms of protection set out in  the  Berne  Convention  and
the Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property  Rights  (TRIPS):  life
plus 50 years for copyrighted works and 50 years  for  neighbouring  rights.
Further  action  should  be  taken  at  international  level  in  order   to
investigate the optimal duration of the term of protection .

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


There is to all intents and purposes no harmonisation in the  EU  for  users
of copyright works in the single market. This makes the cross-border use  of
copyright  works  problematic.  From  the  perspective  of  a   pan-European
organisation such as LIBER it is clear that heterogeneity of  exceptions  in
national copyright legislation is blocking the development of  an  effective
and  efficient  collaborative  data  infrastructure.  In  the  digital   age
research is becoming increasingly collaborative and international,  yet,  as
exceptions relevant to researchers have not been  adopted  in  all  European
countries, an uneven playing field exists for researchers in terms of  their
ability   to   access   and   exploit   information   in   a   collaborative
infrastructure. This uneven playing  field  also  exists  amongst  libraries
wishing to preserve and provide access to cultural heritage. The  fact  that
the  exceptions  benefitting  publicly  accessible  libraries,  museums  and
archives have  not  been  implemented  (uniformly)  in  all  member  states,
creates unnecessary  uncertainties.  One  example  of  the  impact  of  this
uncertainty  is  the  Europeana  Newspapers  Project,  which  aims  to  make
historical newspapers available via Europeana.  Due  to  different  national
interpretations of copyright exceptions and limitations there are huge  gaps
between what and  how  the  content  from  different  institutions  is  made
available.

All those that relate to education, learning and access to knowledge  should
be mandatory. A harmonised approach to the adoption  and  implementation  of
limitations and  exceptions  across  Europe  is  required  to  reduce  legal
uncertainty and to promote  the  circulation  of  knowledge  in  the  single
market.

  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


In light of the collaborative nature  of  research  and  the  potential  for
digital technology to facilitate efficiencies in the provision of access  to
and  the  preservation  of  our  cultural  heritage,  I  would  suggest  the
following exceptions: ● Text and data mining for all research purposes  (see
answer to Q53-57 for elaboration) ● An exception to ensure that  nothing  in
a contract undermines limitations and exceptions in copyright  law.  Without
such an exception the harmonisation of exceptions is pointless  as  it  will
be undermined my licence agreements. ●  Legal  certainty  for  e-lending  by
libraries analogous to analogue e-lending ●  A  new  preservation  exception
allowing  preservation  networks  between   institutions   (currently   most
preservation  exceptions  relate  to  preserving  material   in   your   own
collection, rather than having digital mirror sites and  activities  between
institutions). Digital preservation is a costly exercise  involving  massive
investment in technology, infrastructure and skills. Storage costs  are  not
decreasing in line with the growth of digital information. The only  way  to
ensure that our cultural heritage remains accessible in  the  future  is  to
reduce duplication of effort and begin to share infrastructure.  ●  Allowing
publicly funded research results to be made openly available  regardless  of
contracts  signed  with  a  publisher.  By  increasing   accessibility   and
availability, and by facilitating the use and reuse of content, open  access
will  play  an  integral  role  in  driving  research  excellence  globally.
Copyright law  should  not  hinder  its  progress.  An  exception  or  legal
instrument should be developed which allows researchers to make the  results
of publicly  funded  research  available  openly,  regardless  of  contracts
signed with a publisher. Open data is also an area of growth  and  potential
driver of research and innovation. It is  important  to  ensure  that  legal
Intellectual Property instruments such as  the  Database  Directive  do  not
conflict with the realisation of this potential and negate the  huge  public
investment in research infrastructures to support  reuse  of  this  data.  ●
Research exceptions  making  no  distinction  between  commercial  and  non-
commercial purposes.  Knowledge  transfer  is  now  at  the  heart  of  what
research universities do. The  lines  between  what  is  non-commercial  and
potentially commercial research are blurred and any  attempt  at  definition
will limit the impact of  research  activities.  ●  No  existing  exceptions
should be removed





  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


A general open-ended exception, compatible with  the  Three  Step  Test,  is
required. This will avoid obsolescence and ensure  that  any  new  copyright
regime  can  accommodate  future  digital  innovations,  maintain   European
competitiveness and be interoperable with copyright regimes  such  as  those
in force in the United States. In an era  of  fast-moving  technologies,  we
believe a closed  list  of  exceptions  is  not  flexible  enough  to  allow
European research institutions to compete with those in  the  United  States
and Asia (Israel, Singapore, South Korea and  Taiwan),  where  fair  use  is
already in place.

  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


The United States, Israel, Singapore  and  South  Korea  have  an  exception
known as ‘fair use’. Rather than allowing a pre-defined activity,  it  is  a
test that can be applied to any activity that uses a copyright work  to  see
if it undermines the legitimate  interests  of  a  rightsholder  or  not.  A
similar law is just one  possible  solution  to  the  current  situation  in
Europe. Without a fair use type  exception,  significant  market  distortion
between European and  aforementioned  countries  could  occur  (e.g.  Google
books  case  in  US),  having  a  potential  impact  on  the  research   and
development capacity of European countries.





  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


Each non global solution has the potential to  generate  market  distortions
which themselves can cause short term reconfiguration of a market.  Research
is highly sensible to such changes or geographic differences  in  regulatory
frameworks or access to research content (and  the  modalities  of  its  re-
use). One example of how the territoriality of  limitations  and  exceptions
can have an impact on research institutes is reflected in  the  findings  of
the US District Court on the Google Books digitisation  project.  The  court
found that that  the  digitisation  of  university  library  collections  by
Google was a fair use under US copyright law.  In  his  ruling,  Judge  Chin
observed  “it  advances  the  progress  of  the  arts  and  sciences,  while
maintaining respectful consideration for the rights  of  authors  and  other
creative  individuals,  and  without  adversely  impacting  the  rights   of
copyright holders.” There is  no  exception  in  EU  law  that  would  allow
European research libraries to engage in an activity  at  this  scale.  This
means that researchers in the  US  have  easier  access  to  more  scholarly
content than their European counterparts. At the European  level,  the  case
of Subito, illustrates how the territoriality of  exceptions  means  that  a
service that is needed by researchers across  Europe  has  been  limited  so
that is serves only those researchers based in one country.

  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

There is a need for such a mechanism because such  limitations  at  national
level do have cross-border effects (even if of a second  order  economically
speaking). Practically, however, it seems difficult  to  develop  a  working
mechanism without redefining deeply  the  usual  consumer  understanding  of
content consumption ( e.g. the case of a student from country A enrolled  in
a MOOC from an institution in country B, using content whose IPR owners  are
in country C). Compensation schemes should only apply if there  is  evidence
of specific harm to authors that cannot be remedied in other way.





Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1 Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Digital information is ephemeral: it is  easily  deleted,  written  over  or
corrupted. Because information technology such  as  hardware,  software  and
digital object formats evolves so rapidly, it can  be  difficult  to  access
and use digital materials created only  a  few  years  ago.  Countless  born
digital works are created every day, but countless born  digital  works  are
also lost every day as they  are  removed,  replaced,  superseded  or  left,
forgotten, in obsolete formats and media. Recommendations  of  the  European
Commission  on  the  digitisation  and  online  accessibility  of   cultural
material and digital preservation (2011) acknowledges that digital  material
has to be managed and maintained; otherwise files  may  be  unreadable  when
the hardware and software used to store them becomes obsolete  and  material
may be lost when storage devices deteriorate over  time.  Current  copyright
regime Most national laws of EU Member States have implemented  in  one  way
or another the preservation exception provided  by  the  paragraph  2(c)  of
article 5 of the EU directive 2001/29/EC on  the  harmonisation  of  certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.  However
in most cases the legislation has been created  with  physical  preservation
in mind and often is ill fitted for the purposes  of  digital  preservation.
Preservation  of  physical  works   generally   requires   only   occasional
activities to repair or restore the  copies  of  works  which  is  perfectly
doable in the current legislative framework. Digital preservation,  however,
requires performing proactively a series of tasks  to  ensure  that  digital
materials can be accessed for as long as  necessary.  For  this  reason  the
UNESCO Vancouver declaration on the memory of the world in the  digital  age
(2012) calls for elaboration of legal frameworks that  support  preservation
of, and access to, digitised cultural heritage. Reproduction rights  Digital
preservation necessarily involves  the  exercise  of  one  or  more  of  the
exclusive rights of the author or other right  holder,  the  most  prominent
being the right of reproduction. Digital works cannot  be  preserved  unless
they can be copied or otherwise acquired  by  a  digital  archive  or  other
preservation institution. Long term management of a digital  work  generally
requires that multiple copies of the work be made over  the  course  of  its
lifetime,  both  to  retain  one  or  more  redundant  copies  in  different
locations and to  perform  migration  of  content  from  an  old  to  a  new
technology to make sure the works can be accessed even when  the  technology
has become obsolete. One of the limitations of the current copyright  regime
is the range of institutions to which the  preservation  exception  applies,
which  differs  from  one  national  jurisdiction  to  another.  While   the
Directive  2001/29/EC  provides  that  exceptions  to  reproduction  can  be
applied to libraries,  museums,  archives  and  educational  establishments,
this often is  not  the  case  in  national  legislation.  For  example,  UK
copyright law provides an exception  that  applies  only  to  libraries  and
archives, which  means  that  other  cultural  organisations  with  valuable
historical collections such as museums or galleries will infringe  copyright
if they copy for preservation  without  express  permission  from  copyright
owners.  According  to  the  WIPO  study  on   Copyright   Limitations   and
exceptions, single copy provisions also apply in Greece, Hungry, Latvia  and
Poland, and Slovenia and Germany also set a limit on the  number  of  copies
that can be made. While the Directive 2011/29/EC does not  limit  the  types
of works which  can  be  reproduced  by  aforementioned  institutions,  some
national legislations have  implemented  limitations  in  this  regard.  For
example UK copyright law only  applies  to  literary,  dramatic  or  musical
works. This means  that  copying  a  sound  recording,  film,  broadcast  or
artistic work for preservation  is  an  infringement  of  copyright,  unless
expressly permitted by copyright owners. In some national  legislations  the
number of copies permitted to be  made  by  aforementioned  institutions  is
limited. For example UK copyright law appears to only permit the  making  of
a single copy,  so  multiple  backup  copies  or  the  use  of  preservation
technology that operates by making multiple copies are not  covered  by  it.
This limitation also impedes the operation  of  legal  deposit  institutions
where the  legal  deposit  law  imposes  a  distribution  of  legal  deposit
materials from one legal deposit library to  other  deposit  libraries  that
also have the right to these works. This limitation  is  recognised  by  the
Recommendation  of  European  Commission  on  the  digitisation  and  online
accessibility of cultural material and  digital  preservation  (2011)  which
asks  Member  States  to  make  explicit  and  clear  provision   in   their
legislation so as  to  allow  multiple  copying  and  migration  of  digital
cultural material by public institutions for preservation purposes. Most  of
the national legislations also provide very specific conditions  which  have
to be met in order for reproduction to be  lawfully  made.  For  example  UK
copyright law provides that the reproduction can be made only  if  the  item
in question is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if  the  existing
format in which the work is stored  has  become  obsolete.  Such  provisions
doesn’t allow for proactive digitisation of  works  in  order  to  create  a
digital copy of a work for preservation purposes, which  is  one  the  tasks
the legal deposit  institutions  have  been  tasked  with.  Moreover,  these
provisions are meaningless in regard to the digital born works if they  have
been damaged (for example through bit rot) or lost  they  cannot  be  copied
anymore. Another limitation which it fails to fulfil  its  intent  regarding
the digitally born works is  the  provision  that  only  copies  of  out-of-
commerce works can be made. As argued above, the preservation  of  digitally
born works must be proactive in the face of  rapidly  changing  technologies
and generally unstable state of the internet resources. However  it  can  be
argued  that  works  published  online  can  never  become  out-of-commerce,
therefore preservation of these works becomes impossible in  principle.  The
most troubling shortcoming of current implementations of  the  exception  is
that in most cases they provide that institutions tasked  with  preservation
can reproduce only works in their holdings.  While  some  EU  Member  States
have  adjusted  their  legal  deposit  legislation  to  include  also  works
published online, including obligation for  legal  deposit  institutions  to
perform so called web harvesting, the current legal deposit  legislation  in
different Member States is wildly inconsistent in this regard. For  example,
it is not clear if the regional nature of copyright  allows  for  harvesting
of web pages belonging to national cultural  heritage  if  they  are  hosted
outside the respective country, created by residents of other  country  (for
example, a web page programmed by a company in the US, while the content  is
created by residents of the respective country) or  have  a  domain  address
outside of the national upper level domain.  Even  more  uncertainty  covers
the works which have been made available by means  of  streaming,  are  made
available by commercial entities outside the country  of  residence  of  the
author or can be only licenced. Some of the examples  include  e-books  made
available on Amazon, musical works made  available  on  iTunes,  audiovisual
works made available on  YouTube,  applications  made  available  on  Google
Market and online computer games made available on Steam. There is no  doubt
that these works should be preserved for future  generations.  To  this  end
the preservation exception should be extended  to  include  also  the  works
made available online and amendments to the legal deposit systems of  Member
States to be made. An even better solution would be to create  an  effective
network of European legal deposit libraries  network  for  digital  content,
which would be fully in line with the Commission  Recommendations  of  2000,
2006 and 2011 for legal  deposit  and  digital  preservation.  For  research
libraries a severe  challenge  is  to  ensure  a  perpetual  access  to  the
electronic journals, which form the  most  important  source  of  scientific
information. As  they  typically  are  made  available  on  the  grounds  of
subscription, the only solution to have a perpetual access  to  these  works
is to licence the reproduction rights of these journals,  which  not  always
is possible. Even for research works published in open access, if  they  are
published  with  a  licence  which  doesn't   explicitly   give   the   user
reproduction rights, a licence has to be obtained in order to  preserve  the
work and thus to avoid the risk that the publication might  get  removed  at
the original source while  it  still  is  necessary  for  researchers.  This
licensing work  is  a  major  cost  element  of  digital  preservation.  The
national library or other national  public  infrastructure  of  the  country
could be made responsible for local hosting  for  preservation  purpose,  as
well  as  for  permanent  access  and  use  of  the  licenced  materials  by
authorized users after the termination of  a  licence  contract.  Since  the
preservation exception  isn't  very  well  harmonised  over  the  EU  Member
States, it seriously impedes  an  effective  cross-border  collaboration  in
digital preservation. Digital preservation  is  a  very  resource  intensive
task, which require advanced technical infrastructure and  the  training  of
experts  in  digital  preservation.  International   centres   for   digital
preservation  would  be  more  efficient(  especially  where  developing   a
national centre of digital preservation would prove impractical and  costly,
for example, for all the  three  Baltic  states).  The  lack  of  harmonised
preservation exceptions  also  severely  impedes  a  broader  use  of  cloud
preservation services, for  example,  the  Preservica  digital  preservation
cloud service developed by the  UK  digital  preservation  experts  Tesella,
which, it could be argued, for this reason is mainly adapted in the US,  but
not the EU. There is currently also some  duplication  of  effort  happening
which could be eliminated by means of  cooperation,  both  an  national  and
international level. For example, in Italy most of the Italian  universities
publish doctoral thesis in their  open  access  institutional  repositories,
however Italian legal deposit libraries duplicate this effort  by  obtaining
these works by means of web harvesting. It can be argued that  it  might  be
done much more effectively by establishing a national  digital  preservation
network  and  not  by  each  institution  digitally   preserving   its   own
collection. International collaboration on EU level  would  make  a  lot  of
sense in the field of web harvesting by allowing cross-border harvesting  or
by enabling the harvesting  of  web  resources  on  behalf  of  preservation
institutions in other EU countries. While some of the  challenges  described
above can be remedied by improvement of national legal deposit  legislation,
some of the aspects, especially  the  ones  regarding  the  preservation  of
licenced  content  and   regarding   the   cross-border   applicability   of
preservation exceptions can be remedied only by changes  in  EU  regulation.
This suggestion has been confirmed  by  the  study  on  the  application  of
Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and  related  rights  in  the  information
society, which was commissioned by the European Commission and  carried  out
by De Wolf & Partners in 2013. One of the conclusions of the study was  that
the exceptions for libraries and archives at the EU level  are  in  need  of
harmonisation  to   facilitate   cross-border   application.   Technological
Protection Measures An issue tightly  connected  with  the  reproduction  of
digitally published  works  for  preservation  in  libraries,  archives  and
museums is the one of technological protection measures. While a  permission
is given to memory institutions in most national legislations to bypass  the
technological protection measures of works in their  holdings  in  order  to
take advantage of the preservation exception, in most cases this  proves  to
be  impractical.  Moreover,  these  provisions  typically  don’t  cover  the
technological protection measures protecting the works which  are  licenced,
not sold or acquired by means of legal deposit, to libraries,  for  example,
e-books protected by  means  of  Adobe  DRM  technology.  Adaptation  rights
Sometimes during the  lifecycle  of  the  digital  preservation  it  becomes
necessary  to  perform  format  shifting.  For  example,  if   any   current
technology becomes obsolete, the work  has  to  be  transformed  to  another
format so as to be readable by current  technological  means.  This  can  be
interpreted as adaptation of work, which  is  not  covered  by  the  current
preservation exception. Also, when format shifting  complex  data,  such  as
geographical data, it is inevitable that the functionality of  the  original
data will be compromised and altered in some sense.  Make  available  rights
The ultimate goal of all the preservation activities is to  make  sure  that
the works of cultural heritage can be accessed and used  at  a  later  date.
Therefore making available of digitally preserved works is an integral  part
of the preservation process. Most of the current preservation exceptions  in
the legislation of EU Member States provide  for  limited  opportunities  to
consult the digital works on premises of  institutions  who  have  performed
the digital preservation, but not all. For  example  the  copyright  law  in
Netherlands does not allow the making available  of  preserved  works.  This
use has to be licenced, which in turn means that the digitised orphan  works
cannot be made available,  at  least  before  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  on
certain  permitted  uses  of  orphan  works  is  not  implemented   in   the
legislation. While more detailed answers on the use of the making  available
rights  in  libraries  are  provided  in  the  next  two  chapters  of  this
consultation, it has to be noted at this point that the use of these  rights
in libraries, archives and museums is deeply  interconnected.  It  is  quite
obvious that copying for preservation purposes does not  in  itself  pose  a
risk to right holders, unlike providing access to these copies.  However  as
long as preservation  institutions  have  appropriate  security  and  access
control measures in place, the interests of  right  holders  should  not  be
threatened by neither by more inclusive preservation exceptions nor by  more
liberal regulations regarding the access to the preserved copies of works.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

The suggested solution to the problems described  above  is  to  expand  the
wording of  the  directive  to  make  it  applicable  also  to  the  digital
preservation activities and to  make  this  exception  mandatory  so  as  to
harmonise it across the EU Member States.  The  latter  has  been  suggested
also by the De Wolf study on the  application  of  Directive  2001/29/EC  on
copyright and related rights in the information society, on the  grounds  of
the current inconsistent implementation of the exception in  the  EU  Member
States,  the  fundamental  freedoms  recognized  by  the   EU   Charter   on
Fundamental Rights and the European public interest. The study  argues  that
it would be a good idea to "make mandatory some key exceptions  that  convey
fundamental European public interests, such as the safeguarding of  European
cultural heritage or  the  development  of  a  European  research  area  and
internal market for education. When those objectives are encumbered  by  the
discrepancies   resulting   from   diverging    national    implementations,
harmonisation of exceptions, with proper conditions and restrictions,  might
be as important as harmonisation of exclusive rights that  was  achieved  in
2001.”






  30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

[Open question]

The  preservation  exception  should  apply  equally   to   all   non-profit
libraries, archives, museums and other institutions as may be authorised  by
national law that are open to the public, provided  they  do  not  undertake
these activities for any purpose of commercial advantage.  The  preservation
exception should apply equally to all categories of  copyrighted  materials,
including literary, artistic, musical and dramatic  works,  as  well  as  to
motion pictures and sound  recordings.  The  preservation  exception  should
apply equally to copyrighted materials in all  media  and  formats,  whether
hard copy or electronic, born digital or digitised  for  preservation.  This
includes also preservation of materials which  are  made  available  to  the
public in digital form or deposited by means of a legal deposit system,  the
legal ability to harvest publicly available online content for  preservation
purposes and  preservation  of  licenced  digital  materials.  To  this  end
licence clauses which override existing exceptions  and  limitations  should
be recognised  null  and  void.  The  preservation  exception  should  allow
preservation institutions to  pro-actively  preserve  copyrighted  materials
before they deteriorate, are damaged or are lost, and  before  any  software
or hardware required to access and use the material becomes  obsolete.  This
includes also right to perform format shifting  and  other  adaptations  for
long-term preservation purposes. To this  end  all  the  licenced  materials
should be made available to preservation institutions without  technological
protection measures  or  together  with  technological  means  necessary  to
remove the technological protection measures.  The  use  of  copies  of  the
licenced materials should be permitted in cases access  to  these  materials
is discontinued or suspended. Moreover, it should be  established  that  the
preservation exception cannot be over-ridden by contract terms of  licences.
As such a solution, which in order to effectively harmonise this  exception,
would require rather detailed provisions to be put forward in  the  text  of
directive, it can also be argued that the preservation  exception  could  be
transformed into a limitation to copyright, defined  by  its  objective  and
some general conditions and including a more open requirement that  the  use
does not exceed what is necessary for its objective. Such an approach  would
make the copyright framework more fit for  its  purpose  and  understandable
for both users and copyright owners. At the same time, if  the  requirements
for this limitation are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice  the
high level of protection of copyright and related rights  that  the  EU  law
has adopted.





  31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

 [Open question]

It can be argued that all of the current problems can be solved by means  of
licensing. However, such approach would be extremely costly  and  burdensome
both for memory institutions and rights  holders.  A  British  Library/ARROW
study on  mass  digitisation  by  libraries  and  archives  found  that,  on
average, it takes almost 6 hours to clear the rights to  digitise  a  single
book, and  it  can  be  assumed  that  rights  clearance  of  complex  works
consisting of a large number  of  separate  works,  belonging  to  different
owners, for example film or broadcast, would take much longer than this.  By
using the data of the annual survey of hours and earnings  of  2011  it  was
estimated that to libraries and archives clearance of a  single  work  costs
on average £95. On the other hand, by using the  information  from  the  PwC
report on educational copying that for copyright owners it takes  4,5  hours
to licence a single work, it was estimated that clearance of a  single  work
costs on average £70. As it was estimated by the British  Library  that  68%
of works in its collections are  copyright  protected  and  out-of-commerce,
and therefore would have to  go  through  a  rights-clearance  process,  the
costs of clearing the copyright for its collection  would  amount  to  £25.9
million  in  administrative  costs   both   to   memory   institutions   and
rightsholders. In face of such prohibitive  costs  many  institutions  would
choose not to digitise these works,  which  in  turn  would  create  a  high
social and cultural cost.  The  opinion  that  libraries  and  other  memory
institutions should not be overburdened by licensing  is  supported  by  the
European Commission, which has pointed out in the document Copyright in  the
knowledge Economy: Libraries and universities underline the  complexity  and
fragmentation  of  the  current  system   of   licensing   agreements   with
publishers. A typical European university is required to sign a  hundred  or
more licences governing the use of digital  research  material  supplied  by
various publishers. Examining what each of these individual licences  permit
with respect to e.g. access, printing, storage and copying is  a  cumbersome
process. I strongly support this position.





2 Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

Licences are frequently negotiated by national licensing  consortia.  It  is
common for licences to prevent cross border access to  digital  content  for
research and  study  by  imposing  limitations  to  specific  territory(ies)
and(or)  category  of  users,  on  a  take-it-or-leave-it  basis.  Licensors
holding significant market  power  happen  to  re-negotiate  licensing  fees
annually and there have been threats of refusing to grant licenses  at  all.
For digital documents it can be difficult to request remote  access  because
the content may only be downloaded on a specific terminal or has  a  special
licence provision and TPMs in place that prevent more  than  one  user  from
accessing the content. Another barrier  is  that  every  country  and  every
publisher use a different platform, tying the library  and  end  user  to  a
multitude of platforms. IFLA has produced a useful background paper  on  the
difficulties libraries experience in licencing and lending  e-books  .  Also
quiet pressing from my perspective, is the ability of libraries  to  provide
online  access  to  collections  they  own.  The   exception   that   allows
institutions to make works in their collections available ‘for  the  purpose
of research or private  study,  to  individual  members  of  the  public  by
dedicated terminals on  the  premises’  is  not  in  line  with  our  user’s
expectations.

  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be

[Open question]

At the legislative level, to facilitate  remote  access  the  scope  of  the
exception currently provided for in article 5(3)n of the  InfoSoc  Directive
should be broadened so that libraries can make their  collections  available
on-line via electronic networks such  as  an  intranet  for  scientific  and
educational purposes without restriction to on-site terminals.

3 E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


From a legal point of  view  e-lending  has  nothing  to  do  with  lending.
Lending can be considered a specific use of the distribution  right  but  e-
lending can be considered a  specific  use  of  making  available  right  in
combination with the reproduction right. Contrary to  lending  e-lending  is
an online service and not subject to exhaustion of rights  after  the  first
communication  of  the  work  to  the  public.  In  practice  e-lending   is
implemented either by giving the user access to the work  for  a  period  of
time, after which the access is denied, or by letting the  user  download  a
version of the work to his reading device which self-destroys after  a  pre-
determined period of time. As any use of the making available to the  public
right requires an authorisation from  rights  holder  for  the  purposes  of
enabling e-lending libraries have to acquire a  licence.  As  a  result  the
ability to acquire commercially published books for library  collections  is
severely constrained. Unlike with physical books publishers  can  refuse  to
grant a licence on e-books to libraries and often they indeed choose  to  do
so.  This  undermines  the  fulfilment  of  libraries  public  mandate   and
threatens libraries role in ensuring freedom of access  to  information  for
all, as enshrined in the Article 19 of the Universal  Declaration  of  Human
Rights. That the acquisition policy of  libraries  may  be  decided  by  the
rights holder and not by the library is unacceptable. Even  when  a  licence
on an e-book is granted, the licensing conditions are often very  stringent.
While the use of physical works in libraries  is  strictly  defined  by  the
current framework of copyright limitations and exceptions, they do not  have
to  be  taken  into  account  in  licences  granting  libraries  the  making
available right to e-books. This  allows  rights  holders  to  enforce  very
strict access rules, unimaginable  in  the  world  of  physical  books.  For
example, quite often licences permit users to consult the  e-books  only  on
premises of library, or doesn't include any reproduction  rights,  including
printing rights. For example, in 2008 the British Library conducted a  study
of over 100 library contracts for electronic resources  and  concluded  that
over  90%  of  contracts  were  more  restrictive  than  exceptions  in  the
copyright law. It can be argued that licensing terms  that  restrict  access
to works beyond the  level  of  national  copyright  exceptions  effectively
allows for rights holders to circumvent the copyright  system  in  order  to
diminish the rights of  information  users  thus  violating  the  spirit  of
copyright law. The De Wolf study on the application of Directive  2001/29/EC
on copyright and related rights in the information society  recognises  that
"the traditional role of  libraries  in  providing  an  alternative  to  get
access to cultural content should be preserved in  the  digital  environment
and their mission should be extended to the provision of e-books  and  other
digital content. To that end, their autonomy should  be  preserved.  Relying
only on the market to deliver e-books to library readers  could  potentially
dictate unreasonable terms and conditions to libraries or  transform  public
lending into another commercial service provided  by  the  publishers".  The
licensing requirements for  research  libraries  and  public  libraries  are
markedly different. Research libraries are used  to  use  a  wide  array  of
subscription services in order to ensure  economically  feasible  access  to
the most recent and most cutting edge research materials  in  the  field  of
interest  to  the  staff  and  students  of  the  given  university.   While
subscription to databases of research journals has been  a  common  practice
for research libraries for a  couple  of  decades,  subscription  to  e-book
databases  is  gradually  supplementing  or  even  replacing   the   printed
monographs. Taking into account the specific needs of their users,  research
libraries are mostly concerned about  such  aspects  as  possibility  for  a
remote access to the works for authorised users and possibility to  copy  or
print parts of the work. The most troubling aspect of  e-book  licensing  is
that the licences typically do not grant  libraries  the  ownership  of  the
copy of the work, or at least the right to make a reproduction of  the  work
for preservation purposes, which subsequently would allow library to  ensure
perpetual access to the licenced work. Libraries have  actually  experienced
instances of publishers revoking licences to  certain  works,  typically  by
removing certain titles from the subscription  packages.  In  theory  it  is
possible that,  if  the  distributor  of  e-books  to  libraries  files  for
bankruptcy and ceases trading, the library might be stripped of  its  entire
e-book collection overnight. For research libraries this might  create  very
serious disruptions in their work. Therefore it is of vital importance  that
libraries should be allowed by the preservation exception to make copies  of
licenced works (see the answers  on  questions  regarding  the  preservation
exception).  An  important  library  service  is  the   interlibrary   loan,
including international interlibrary loan, which ensures that  everyone  can
get an access to the every work published even if it is not carried  by  the
local library. However, virtually no e-book licences  granted  to  libraries
allow these works to be loaned  to  other  libraries,  let  alone  in  other
countries. The concerns have been  voiced  by  publishers  that  this  would
allow for a work licenced to one  library  be  instantaneously  supplied  to
library users anywhere in the world. While this certainly would be  true  if
licences allowed an international interlibrary lending, it would not  create
any threats to the economic interests of rightsholders if  proper  safeguard
mechanisms were built into the agreements, for example ensuring that a  work
can be simultaneously lent out  only  to  one  reader,  thus  mimicking  the

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]

It can be argued that the easiest and most effective way to remedy  all  the
current problems with the lending of e-books by libraries would be to  apply
the principle of exhaustion of rights after the first sale of work  also  to
digital works so that the framework of public lending can be used  also  for
lending of digitally published works. However, it has to be recognised  that
this solution would affect not only the e-books but all digitally  published
works, from audiovisual materials to software,  and  not  only  the  use  of
works by libraries but a wide range of uses, most notably resale of  digital
works. Therefore it  is  understood  that  such  a  drastic  change  in  the
copyright framework  would  require  very  careful  consideration  from  all
aspects so as not to upset the balance of rightful interests of both  rights
holders and users of works. Even in the case  that  e-lending  in  libraries
continues to be enabled by  means  of  licensing  there  is  room  for  less
drastic changes in legislation that  would  remedy  the  problems  described
above a great deal. The main aim of these changes would be to make sure  the
existing copyright limitations and exceptions apply also to  the  contracts,
thus granting libraries the right to copy a portion of  the  work,  reformat
the work for preservation  purposes,  provide  an  interlibrary  loan  copy,
reformat  the  work  to  enable  print  disabled  access,   and   bypass   a
technological protection measure for the  purpose  of  exercising  any  non-
infringing purposes. Moreover, the exclusive rights that  exist  in  regards
to published works should not include  the  right  of  refusal  to  sell  to
libraries, or  to  limit  their  services,  both  in  physical  and  digital
environment. This means that the copyright  directive  should  provide  that
contracts cannot override limitations and  exceptions,  and,  in  turn,  any
terms of a contract violating existing limitations and exception  should  be
considered null and void. This view is supported by  the  Hargreaves  Review
on Intellectual Property and Growth,  commissioned  by  the  UK  Government,
which explicitly recommends that  the  UK  Government  should  legislate  to
ensure copyright exceptions and limitations are protected from  override  by
contract. Moreover, this provision has to be  made  mandatory  in  order  to
harmonise the legislation of all the EU  Member  States  and  to  make  such
services as international interlibrary loan of e-books lawful. It has to  be
acknowledged that just like the loan  of  works  in  tangible  form  the  e-
lending should be adequately remunerated to rights holders. To this  end  it
has to be made sure that any public lending right scheme should  apply  also
to e-lending. The Digital  Economy  Act  of  the  UK  in  2010  has  already
extended the public lending scheme to audio books and loans  of  e-books  on
the premises of libraries, however it still has  to  be  enacted.  Moreover,
further legislative changes should be made to  take  account  of  remote  e-
loans. At the same time that the methods used to  establish  the  amount  of
money to be distributed towards  the  remuneration  of  rights  holders  for
lending should be reviewed when introducing a  remuneration  for  e-lending,
as it wouldn't be fair if the same amount of money is split among a  broader
base of rights holders or would compensate for a bigger number of loans.





The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

The management and availability of physical and  online  collections  should
be guided by  the  same  principles  according  to  the  public  mandate  of
libraries. Libraries  and  other  memory  institutions  will  inevitably  be
required by society to provide broader and richer online services while  not
compromising the quality and availability of current  services  provided  in
person. Therefore physical collections and services and digital  collections
and services  should  be  recognized  and  treated  as  two  equivalent  and
complementary rather than contradictory ways of providing  library  services
to the society.





  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

4 Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


I am only aware of 4 countries that have laws currently in  place  to  allow
mass digitisation (Norway, Sweden, Finland,  Denmark  and  France).  Germany
has just passed a law in 2013 to introduce a law based on the MOU on Out  of
Commerce Works, and the UK which is in the process of  introducing  Extended
Collective Licensing may end  up  with  a  legal  mechanism  to  allow  mass
digitisation but at the moment this depends on  whether  the  UK  collecting
societies are in a position to, or choose to  offer  an  ECL  to  facilitate
mass digitisation. The MOU has no legal status at all.  Whether  a  library,
university or can lawfully digitise its collections and make them  available
online lawfully is solely is dependent on amendments to  copyright  law.  As
pointed out above, I am only aware of 3 EU  countries  that  currently  have
such laws, with Germany in the process of introducing a  concrete  law  that
will directly facilitate mass digitisation. Any legislation of  this  nature
requires a cross border effect. This is for a number of reasons: i)  Firstly
the digitisation may include rightsholders from more than just  the  country
of origin; ii) Secondly mechanisms such  as  extended  collective  licensing
and the French and German  models  are  by  definition  representing  orphan
works and non-members and therefore a lawful cross-border effect  is  needed
to ensure that their use outside the country of origin is  lawful;  iii)  As
with the Orphan Works Directive 2012 and the Satellite and  Cable  Directive
1993 without legislation all Member States and their courts could  determine
that the communication to the public of digitised  content  from  the  above
countries is  a  restricted  act.  We  believe  not  only  is  it  extremely
important to have not only American material available on the internet,  but
that there is a huge demand amongst citizens, scholars  and  publishers  for
such activities to take place. Looking at Norway, for example,  as  of  2012
the Bøkhylla book digitisation project had over 259,000 unique  users  (5.2%
of the population), with 46 pages opened  per  visit.  We  strongly  believe
that the online availability of in-copyright works from across  Europe  will
have a  transformative  and  hugely  positive  effect  on  the  educational,
cultural, creative and financial life of this continent.

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


In German universities professors often complain about the uncertain  rights
situation concerning the use of images in slides/presentations, as  well  as
citing other material or providing students with  additional  material.  The
German High Federal Court just recently ruled that no more than 10-20% of  a
book may be provided to students as additional teaching material.  Moreover,
publishers claim that there is no adequate remuneration for  making  use  of
their material (German law provides for a limitation with  remuneration  for
rightholders  concerning  the  use  of  material  for  teaching).  Directive
2001/29/EC enabled the implementation of limitations or exceptions  for  the
purpose of teaching, however the implementation of  those  limitations  were
not required. This lack of obligation led to a different approach  in  every
Member    State.    A    study    conducted    by    Professor    Xalabarder
[http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=130393]  shows   the
heterogeneity of teaching exceptions all over  the  EU.  In  countries  like
Spain, the teaching limitation has  been  narrowed  and  teachers  are  only
allowed to use small fragments of a work in a physical  classroom  if  those
works are not textbooks and they are from a  formal  education  institution.
This implementation excludes many kinds of education and it excludes  a  lot
of  works.  Moreover,  the  misunderstanding  on  the  use  of   works   for
educational purposes by educators  has  led  to  some  Spanish  universities
being sued by a  collecting  society.  On  the  other  hand,  the  directive
allowed the implementation of an exception  for  reproduction  in  libraries
when the copies were made for educational purposes. This exception does  not
exist in Spain and libraries are only allowed to make  copies  for  research
or conservation. We would  also  highlight  the  point  that  not  only  are
students  across  the  EU  increasingly   studying   across   borders,   but
universities are increasingly  establishing  campuses  abroad  and  teaching
through the internet via Virtual Learning Environments. According to the  UK
Higher Education Statistics Agency there are 598,925 students  studying  for
degrees outside the UK – of these 78,000 are in the European Union.  Studies
from the Observatory on Borderless  Higher  Education  shows  that  American
universities are also increasingly targeting the EU as  a  good  market  for
the growth of foreign campuses. While US universities will no  doubt  assert
the cross-border applicability of US limitations and  exceptions,  including
fair use where technology has developed ahead of  specific  limitations  and
exceptions, we believe that European internet based learning will  be  at  a
clear competitive disadvantage given the fragmented nature of  member  state
copyright  laws,  and  the  lack  of  clarity  around   their   cross-border
applicability. There are of course a number of reasons why MOOCs in  the  US
are far ahead  those  of  Europe,  language  being  one,  but  it  would  be
incorrect to not cite that one of the factors will be the flexibility of  US
limitations and exceptions.

  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Legal uncertainly in the education  sector  must  be  addressed.  A  broader
mandatory exception for teaching without limiting the kind of works  or  the
kind of educational premises is necessary. The exception in Art 5.3.  should
be implemented uniformly across Member States. Introducing a  European  wide
limitation for copying as well as making available to the  public  (combined
with adequate remuneration) would be the best  solution,  in  particular  to
deal with cross border issues, as licensing proves to  be  quite  difficult.
Moreover, eLearning  across  borders  is  quite  difficult  to  support  (no
internal market for eLearning) so long as licences tend to be regional.  The
situation is not very different from that  in  music  markets;  nevertheless
such a directive as the proposed on licensing for music  is  missing.  Spain
has drafted a new law including mandatory remuneration. It is  dangerous  to
have such a system because, as it is proposed, it would  include  any  work,
for  instance  open  access  articles  or  open  educational  resources.  If
mandatory compensation is deemed necessary we should exclude all works  that
authors  open  for  free  without  expecting  any  compensation,   if   not,
universities will have to pay to collecting societies  an  amount  of  money
that will never go to the real authors.







  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

[Open question]

Current solutions include extensive collective licensing or agreements  with
publishers at national level.  Such  mechanisms  are  not  comprehensive  in
terms of content or  uses  covered  and  can  be  very  expensive  and  time
consuming to implement. Indeed, such is  the  lack  of  clarity  around  the
coverage  of  these  mechanism  that  institutions  can  end  up  requesting
permissions for uses which  do  not  need  to  be  licenced.  The  different
mechanisms (e.g. a flat fee per student system  in  Spain  v.  a  collective
licencing scheme in Finland) available at national level  have  resulted  in
inconsistencies in the use of material for teaching purposes across Europe.







  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]

A broad mandatory exception for teaching that would facilitate  a  fair  and
proportionate use of  in  copyright  works  e.g.  the  use  of  Websites  in
education is needed. This mandatory educational exception should  cover  all
uses of all types of works for illustration of teaching, regardless  of  the
institution. It is important to  stress  that  uses  of  computer  programs,
databases and multimedia works (such as video  games)  should  be  expressly
included. It  should  also  be  made  possible  for  anyone  to  make  works
available on-line for educational purposes without  restriction  to  on-site
terminals, both in original form, as well as in the form  of  an  adaptation
or compilation, both in analogue and digital  form.  Activities  related  to
eLearning should also be covered (enlargement  of  limitation  to  citation)
and should apply to all Member States.  Another  complementary  solution  is
that any author should be allowed to  reuse  her  own  material,  overriding
copyright agreements with  a  publisher,  in  educational  setting  such  as
classrooms or in a VLE.





  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

Besides the aforementioned legislative solution, any  teaching  material  or
educational resource funded by public money should be disseminated openly.






Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

SUBITO  CASE.  International  document  supply  by  libraries.   This   case
illustrates the legal uncertainty  in  providing  international  researchers
and libraries with copies of articles  for  non-commercial  research  .While
most, if not all, EU countries allow a library to supply for  non-commercial
purposes someone an article for their non-commercial  /  research  purposes,
the cross border situation is  unclear  given  the  lack  of  uniformity  of
Member State copyright laws. This illegal uncertainty  forces  libraries  to
use licensing as the only way to guarantee cross border supply of  documents
for research purposes (with publishers being  able  to  exclude  titles  and
countries in the license and charge fees that  are  simply  not  appropriate
for students and teachers, but set  at  commercial  rates  for  businesses).
SUBITO is a  library  document  delivery  service  of  the  German  speaking
countries.  SUBITO  delivered  copies  of  documents  to  final  users   and
libraries (both foreign and  national)  for,  among  others,  non-commercial
uses, including non- commercial research purposes. Legal  action  was  taken
against SUBITO  in  2006,  questioning  the  compliance  of  its  electronic
document (pdf) delivery services  with  German  copyright  law  and  foreign
copyright  laws  when  the  delivery  was  crossborder.   In   relation   to
international deliveries, the court determined that the legal  situation  is
determined according to both the German and foreign  copyright  law,  making
it in practice extremely complicated for Subito to comply with all  national
laws.  Currently,  international   delivery   to   libraries   in   Germany,
Switzerland,  Austria  and  Liechtenstein  is  allowed  for   non-commercial
purposes. Subito has negotiated licences with publishing  houses  to  enable
Subito to offer copies (by post, fax or  electronically  with  Technological
Protection Measures (TPMs)). The agreement  provides  for  royalties  to  be
paid for each copy that is sent and it  allows  the  publishing  houses  the
possibility to exclude certain publications from the licence.  According  to
Subito’s site: “the alternative solution of seeking to achieve a  sufficient
degree of legal certainty by having the legal situation verified in  all  of
those countries to which subito e.V. delivers would have  entailed  devoting
a disproportionate amount of time  and  effort”.  While  as  an  economy  we
should be promoting the knowledge economy  we  find  it  at  odds  with  the
principle of a single market that an individual in Germany can  be  supplied
with an article from a  library  in  Berlin  for  their  own  non-commercial
research purposes, but a student in Dublin, Athens, Madrid or  Warsaw  would
not be able to be sent the same article. OPENAIRE OpenAIRE is  an  EU-funded
open  access  infrastructure  for  research  that  supports   the   European
Commission’s Open  Access  policies  (FP7  pilot  on  OA  and  H2020  OA  to
publications policy  and  Open  Data  pilot).  The  infrastructure  aims  to
support open scholarly communications and provide worldwide  access  to  the
research output of European projects and open access  content  (publications
and research data and datasets) from  European  repositories,  data  centres
and publishers. The project gathers open access content from almost  all  of
the countries in the European  Union.  OpenAIRE  has  published  study  that
analyses the potential  impact  that  the  current  copyright  and  database
directives might have on this research e-infrastructure and  the  re-use  of
data. Copyright directive and open access research e-infrastructures In  the
event  that  copyright  protected  data  is  used  within  an  open   access
scientific  information   e-infrastructure,   exclusive   rights   such   as
reproduction, communication and adaptation might  be  infringed.  The  study
concludes that even though the InfoSoc Directive  gives  Member  States  the
opportunity for exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right and  the
public communication right for scientific  purposes,  these  exceptions  are
adopted very differently. Under the current copyright framework, it  is  not
possible to create an e-infrastructure  that  respects  copyright  laws  and
falls under exceptions  and  limitations  in  every  European  country.  Sui
Generis  database   protection   right   and   open   access   research   e-
infrastructures If the  data  used  in  the  infrastructure  is  part  of  a
database (protected by sui-generis right), rights of the of  extraction  and
re-utilisation are restricted.  As  with  the  copyright  directive,  Member
States can include an exception to these rights in their national  laws  for
research purposes, but these exceptions are not harmonised  within  the  EU,
making it impossible for the infrastructure to comply  with  every  national
law. Specific uses of the open access research-infrastructure by end  users.
Some cases of exploitation of  the  information  offered  contained  in  the
infrastructure have been described as potentially infringing  copyright  and
the database directive, and national copyright and databases  laws  such  as
access, linking (e.g. papers to research data), mining and re-use.

  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

According to the above-mentioned study, the barriers to fully exploiting  an
open access e-infrastructure for research described above  could  be  solved
by: Introducing a new broader mandatory research exception at  the  European
level; Making limitations of the database directive mandatory;  By  widening
the limitations to the database directive to infrastructure  operators  such
as non-commercial scientific databases the barriers for exchanging data  and
also metadata could be overcome. Moreover, the right to make the  data  (and
database) available to the public on a non-commercial uses basis  should  be
integrated as well.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain


Since in most cases it is necessary to make a copy of the content  in  order
for a machine to extract facts and data for mining,  the  act  of  text  and
data mining is precluded under copyright law in Europe. Because it  protects
against the copying of large portions of databases, the  Database  Directive
is also a legal barrier  to  text  and  data  mining.  Technical  protection
measures (also protected under law), preventing  the  downloading  of  large
amounts of content, are also preventing the application  of  text  and  data
mining techniques. Although text and  data  mining  is  concerned  with  the
extraction of facts and data, the results of text and data  mining  research
are currently being suppressed because of a lack of legal clarity.  Even  if
content  is  openly  available  on  the  Web,  without  explicit  permission
indicating otherwise, it is unclear if the copying of this content  for  the
purpose of text and data  mining  is  legal.  Content  licenced  under  open
access  licences  such  as  cc-by-sa  or  cc-by-nc  may   be   inadvertently
preventing users from mining the content  either  because  of  the  lack  of
clarity in the law about the use of facts and data and their requirement  to
acknowledge or because such  conditions  such  as  Share  Alike  are  almost
impossible to implement when mining across a corpus. As highlighted by  both
the Japanese and UK governments who are the only two countries in the  world
who respectively have / are introducing a specific limitation and  exception
for text and data mine, this is  an  area  where  a  law  designed  for  the
printing press does not seem able  to  cope  proportionately  or  adequately
with new technologies. For example we would highlight the  following  points
that show that in  the  case  of  data  analytics  it  is  not  enabling  of
innovation to “stretch” a law designed to regulate paper  printing  and  the
artistic expression of an author. i) Some forms  of  text  and  data  mining
produce probabilities / hypotheses from what is not  written  about  in  the
text. How is a law that  regulates  artistic  expression  applicable  to  an
activity that uses what has not been expressed? j) The  activity  is  lawful
if performed using a pen and paper as only facts and data  are  extracted  –
it is only because the EU Copyright Directive regulates the fact a  computer
must copy, irrespective of the financial harm  the  simple  act  of  copying
with no communication  to  public  over  and  above  what  is  lawful,  that
copyright law and database law is relevant. k) Text  and  Data  mining  does
not use the artistic expression that copyright law is there to  protect  but
analyses the underlying facts (that one has lawful access  to  already).  l)
Copyright law is an exclusive  right,  in  part  designed  to  maximise  the
financial rewards of rightsholders, by allowing them to  control  the  level
of distribution of a work. In this  sense  by  being  able  to  control  the
scarcity of a copyright work, it protects investment in  the  production  of
the work, and allows off the back of financial rewards, more investment  and
innovation to take place. In the case of text and  data  mining,  where  you
already have access to the work, it is difficult to make the  argument  that
by further restricting access to the work innovation will be encouraged.  We
believe that text and  data  mining  really  has  nothing  to  do  with  the
principles behind  copyright  and  database  rights,  and  it  needs  to  be
recognised that the single  reason  it  does  is  because  mere  copying  by
machines and an arrangement of content (irrespective of whether any harm  is
done or not their use) has become subject to copyright law.

  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

For the sake of transparency and reproducibility, researchers must  be  able
to share the results of text and data mining, as long as these  results  are
not  substitutable  for  the  original  copyright  work  -  irrespective  of
copyright law,  database  law  or  contractual  terms  to  the  contrary.  A
specific exception to this effect allowing the copying of  content  for  the
purpose of text and data mining is necessary. Such an exception  should  not
distinguish between commercial and non-commercial purposes as, for  research
institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer.






  55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]

A legislative solution should take the form of  an  exception  which  allows
the copying of content and the circumvention  of  TPMs  for  text  and  data
mining purposes. This exception must not be over-ridable  by  contracts  and
should not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial purposes.





  56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

Licencing will not work as  an  alternative  solution.  The  negotiation  of
licences is resource intensive and unscalable. Nor will  licences  addresses
the current ambiguity around the mining of the open Web.





  57. Are there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
      barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

There is still a gap in the availability of technology and skills for text
and data mining, but as legal barriers are reduced, market-led solutions to
fill these gaps will emerge. An increase in the availability of open access
content (articles and data) and infrastructure will also make TDM easier.





User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the

      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

No. In the light of the UK’s Digital Economy Act we are extremely  concerned
that any  legislation  that  relates  to  intermediaries,  carefully  thinks
through the roles, obligations and safe harbours and  how  they  pertain  to
the many different  types  of  online  intermediary.  We  believe  that  the
European Commission and Parliament could learn much from the  mistakes  made
by the UK government who in the drafting of the  Three  Strikes  Legislation
did not  differentiate  between  intermediaries  such  as  ISPs  and  mobile
telcos, and organisations such  as  libraries,  educational  establishments,
local governments and cafes and hotels all who of  course  intermediate  the
internet. We believe that a concept such as “public intermediary”  may  well
be a useful  concept  when  and  if  further  consideration  of  the  roles,
responsibilities and liabilities is undertaken by the European legislature.






  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

A pragmatic approach should be taken. A general move  towards  harmonisation
(within  EU  and  globally)  should  be  supported,  whereas  priorities  in
relation to European regulation should be set according to  the  ability  of
the market to self-regulate. Reasons to regulate  should  be  restricted  to
inefficient markets and not be guided by calls from actors in  such  markets
who  fear  losing  their  position  through  market   reconfiguration.   The
development of a copyright title should not be  rushed  and  should  involve
further consultation  with  stakeholders.  LIBER  believes  that  the  first
priority should be the revision of  the  Information  Society  Directive  to
include additional exceptions and to clarify and  make  existing  exceptions
mandatory. The Database Directive should also be  revised.  Exceptions  must
be harmonised  across  Member  States.  Interpretive  guidelines  should  be
produced in order to encourage EU countries to promote more flexibility  and
a user-friendly approach. Harmonisation must not result in the reduction  of
flexibility in current exceptions. In our view  a  less  flexible  copyright
regime would seriously hinder research and innovation in Europe.





VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

[Open question]

1. A major concern is that copyright exceptions may be prevented from  being
enforced by technological protection measures or by provisions  included  in
licence agreements, or a combination of both. Much  has  been  made  of  the
necessity for a digital single  market  at  EU  level.  Effort  invested  in
creating a legislative framework to  facilitate  this  market  will  be  for
nothing if  that  framework  can  be  undermined  by  heterogeneous  licence
agreements.  Libraries  and  the  researchers  they  support  need  to  have
confidence that they can operate and innovate within  the  legal  framework.
Exceptions reinforce  this  confidence  and  should  not  be  undermined  by
supplicating  legislation  to  licences.  On  a  practical   note,   it   is
unrealistic to expect individual researchers to become experts on  licensing
terms and their implications (libraries employ  dedicated  full  time  staff
for this), yet this is exactly what  click-through  licences  for  text  and
data mining, for  example,  expect  of  researchers.  Down-stream  this  can
potentially result  in  the  suppression  of  research  results  because  of
resulting legal uncertainties. In summary, I  strongly  recommend  that  the
European  legal  framework  explicity  prevents  licences  from   overriding
exceptions and that  the  copyright  framework  should  also  recognise  the
occasional need for libraries to  use  or  create  software  that  can  help
circumvent these measures for the purpose of making and facilitating  lawful
use of a work. 2.  As  reflected  in  our  answers,  the  copyright  and  IP
framework can have  a  major  impact  our  research  and  cultural  heritage
activities. In particular we believe that  any  revision  of  the  copyright
framework should be considered within the context of the  major  investments
and policies being developed in  relation  to  research  infrastructures  at
European  level  and  should  be  developed  in  collaboration  with   other
Commission Directorates such as DG Research & Innovation and DG Connect.

[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[15] For possible  long  term  measures  such  as  the  establishment  of  a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title)  see  section  VII  of
this consultation document.
[16] Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
22 May 2001 on  the  harmonisation  of  certain  aspects  of  copyright  and
related rights in the information society.
[17] Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs.
[18] Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[24] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

279/13 (C More entertainment).

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[31] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[40] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[45] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

[53] A typical example could be the “kitchen”  or  “wedding”  video  (adding
one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
