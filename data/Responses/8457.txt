Introduction

Context of the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a
novel, a song),for new and existingdistribution platforms,for
institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research
and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –
for information, education or entertainment purposes –
regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges.One of themis for
the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution
and use.Another oneis for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains
appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This
consultation focuses on the second of these challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory frameworkstays fit
for purpose in the digital environmentto support creation and
innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market,fostergrowth andinvestment in our economy
andpromotecultural diversity.

In its"Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:ontheone
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication (2012)789.

with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table
legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder
dialogue"Licences for Europe"on issues on which rapid progress
was deemed necessary and possible.

The"Licences for Europe"process has been finalised now4

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in thiscontext and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content,audiovisual andfilm heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledgesto bea further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups –user-generated content
andtext and data mining–did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. Thediscussions andresults
of"Licences for Europe"will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of thereview process, the Commission is now launching a
public consultation onissuesidentified in the Communication on
Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality in
the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions
to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU
copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in
the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European CouncilConclusions5

EUCO 169/13, 24/25 October 2013.

"Providingdigital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the
digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its
on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014.
It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and
facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the"Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)
466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the"Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011) 427
final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.

and"Content Online"8

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions,on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination
of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in
the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders
representing all stages in the value chain, including right
holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions
elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The
"Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed
up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the
online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management
Directive and into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why is it not possible to accessmany online content servicesfrom
anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights involved
in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market
through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the
territory of the Member State granting them.Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced
on a country-by-country basis under national law9

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders.A number of stepshave beentaken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territoriallicences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10

Proposalfor a Directiveof the European Parliament and of the
Councilof 11 July 2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery of
multi-territorial licences in musical worksfor online
services11

CollectiveManagementOrganisations play a significant role inthe
management of online rights for musical works in contrastto
thesituation where online rights are licenseddirectly by right
holders such asfilm or record producers or by newspaper or book
publishers.

;the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12

You can find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even if the “same” service is available in all
Member States, consumers cannot access the service across
borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if
they try to access the "same" service in another Member State
they are redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of
aEuropean Copyright Code(establishinga single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems whentryingto access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State,
the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium

content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and
newspapers, games, applications and other software)

experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.
business decisions relating to the cost of providing services
across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member

If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

I thinkthat industry led solutions are the most pragmatic and
best way to go forward. “Licensing for Europe” is a good
example.

[In particular if you area right holder or acollective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

YES – Please explain by giving examples

There is alocal consumer demand towards a preference for local
content, with language playing a role and due to cultural
differences and consumer preferences.

Apart from that the approaches of individual licensors will
obviously vary, there are further objective reasons for
territorial licensing,independentlyfrom copyright and marketing
aspects,whichjustify different national approaches:

- youthprotection rules,

-regulations on advertising,

-technical reasons including roaming costs,

-focus on the home market to ensure financial success before
taking thefinancial risk to go live in other markets.

The freedom of the right holder to decide in which market and
when to exploit his rights reflects and supports cultural
diversity: the right holder is most likely to make his content
available in the very region where sufficient demand arises. If
an obligation to go live in the entire EC simultaneously has the
consequence that the costs are too high for the right holder,
such provisions would be likely to deter the right holder to go
live at all. Consequently, such a regime would be detrimental to
the notion of supporting cultural diversity.

NO

NO OPINION

[In particular if you aree.g. a broadcasteror a service
provider:]Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

As mentioned already in the response to Q 5, local consumer
demand tends towards a preference for local content because of
the language as well as the cultural differences.

 NO

 NO OPINION

Do you think that further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at
EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
ofprotection for right holders?

YES – Please explain

NO– Please explain

No,I think thatthe current legislative framework provides the
necessary foundation for cross-border availability of services.
In the absence of evidence of market failure, there should be no
legislative or policy intervention in the audiovisual industry’s
commercial and contractual freedom with regard to territoriality
and exclusivity provisions.

NO OPINION

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?[The
definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in the digital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEUdirectives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases18

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/ECharmonisestherights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders19

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.

which are essential for thetransmission of digital copiesof
works(e.g. an e-book)and other protected subject matter(e.g. a
record in a MP3 format)over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The mostrelevantrightsfor digital transmissionsarethe
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20

The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect,
temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any
form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC)
although temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or
incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).

,(notablyrelevant at the start of the transmission –e.g. the
uploading ofadigital copy of a work to a serverin view ofmaking
it available–and at the users’ end– e.g. when a user downloads
a digital copy of a work)and the communication to the
public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or
prohibit thedissemination of the works in digital networks21

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public “on demand” (seeArt. 3 of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

.These rightsare intrinsically linked in digital
transmissionsandboth need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifiesneitherwhatis covered bythe making
available right(e.g. the upload,the accessibility by the
public,theactualreception by the public)norwherethe act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where thecontent is effectively accessed?).The
most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European
Union (CJEU)suggests that a relevant criterion is
the“targeting” of a certainMember State'spublic22

See in particularCase C-173/11(Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
andCase C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction seealso joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer
and Hotel Alpenhof)andpending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk);
seehowever,adopting a different approach, CaseC-170/12
(Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

. According to this approachthecopyright-relevant act(which has
to be licensed) occurs at leastin those countries which are
“targeted” by the online service provider.A service provider
“targets” a group of customers residing in a specific country
when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

Isthe scope of the“making available”right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders
–sufficiently clear?

YES

The scope of the right of making available in cross-border
situations is sufficiently clear – particularly in light of the
recent jurisprudence of the CJEU.

The nature of the right of making available right for copyright
works is such that it takes place both where the offer is made
and where it is capable of being accessed by consumers. This is
important not only to the licensing of content but also to
determining the jurisdiction and/or the applicable law for
right holders to enforce their rights against infringers and
online intermediaries. Consequently the right covers acts
taking place not only in the country of origin but everywhere
where the access by consumers has an economic effect to the
disadvantage of the right holder and the content provider
enables such access.

“Streaming” is a prime example of such accessing of content.

NO–Pleaseexplain how this could be clarified and what
typeofclarification would be required(e.g.as in "targeting"
approach explained above,as in "country of origin"approach23

The objective of implementing a “country of origin”approachis to
localise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in a
single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in whichthe content is uploaded or
wherethe service provider is established), regardless of in how
many Member States the work canbe accessed or received. Such an
approachhas already been introduced at EU level with regard to
broadcasting by satellite(seeDirective 93/83/EEC on the
coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights
related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and
cable retransmission).

)

NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights or not),onyour
remuneration, oron the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief24

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

YES – Please explain howsuchpotential effectscould
beaddressed

If a “clarification” is seen as implementing a “country of
origin” principle, this would be in contradiction with general
principles of copyright and the objective to safeguard a high
level of protection for right holders.

Anti-piracy enforcement against services made available either
in other EU countries or in third countries would be seriously
impeded if such offers could not be fought against in the very
markets where such service is not originating from, but where
it is accessible and accessed.

A different approach would seriously harm right holders, who
then could not fight services having a serious negative
economic impact on licensed services. Quite to the contrary,
this would support anonymous infringers.

An analogous application of the so-called „country-of origin”
principle which is applicable with regard to the broadcasting
right is inappropriate in connection with the right of making
available because of the individual use element which is
inherent in the right of making available. The right to make
available to the public is the right to make publicly
accessible the work, on a wired or wireless basis, and in such
a way that it is accessible for members of the public from
places and at timesof their choice. The difference between the
right of making available and the broadcasting right is this
individual use element and therefore these rights have to be
treated differently.

I amtherefore convinced that no country-of-origin approach
should be introduced. Such a concept would be detrimental to
current law and jurisprudence of the CJEU and the European
Charta of Human Rights.

NO

NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails(in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.This
means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. Thismay complicate the licensing of works for online
usenotably whenthetwo rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[In particular if youa service provider or a right holder:]Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

YES – Please explainwhat type of measureswould be needed in
order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands,legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

 NO

The application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation is a legal banality which does not cause any
problems in practice.

NO OPINION

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU26

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright,either in generalor
under specific circumstances,besubject to the authorisation of
the rightholder?

YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specificcircumstances, and why

The term “hyperlink” covers various forms of links, many of
which directly enable the access to a work without any
additional technical steps required to be taken in between. In
accordance with the jurisprudence of the CJEU, the cumulative
economic effects of such forms of access and use of works has
to be taken into account so that the right holders can
adequately profit from such new forms of use and the markets
which come into existence on this basis. Consequently, the
provision of any form of a hyperlink directly leading to a work
should require the authorization of the rightholder. However,
this question is currently pending before the CJEU (C-279/13, C
More) and will be solved by the CJEU anyway soon. Therefore, no
legislative steps need to be taken in this respect.

 NO – Please explainwhether you consider this to be the case
in general,or under specific circumstances, and why(e.g.
because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception)

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should the viewing of a web-page where this impliesthetemporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under
copyrighton the screen and in thecachememory of the user’s
computer,either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

 YES – Please explainwhether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

The mere viewing does not require any authorization of the right
holder. Yet, frequently the “mere viewing” does cause cache
copies which are permanent: Depending on the software used,
cache memory copies are often stored permanently today (eg the
so called DivX player enables this). Even if only temporary
copies are made, the concept of the “making available right” is
designed to cover on demand services which are available around
the clock, 24/7, thereby substituting permanent reproductions
in a truly comfortable way for the benefit of the end user and
causing a significant cumulative economic effect. For these
reasons and in line with the goal of the InfoSoc-Directive
2001/29 (eg recital 10), streaming by the end user shall
continue to require the authorization of the right holder.

 NO – Please explainwhether you consider this to be the case

Download to own digital content

Digital content is increasinglybeing boughtvia
digitaltransmission(e.g. download to own). Questions arise as
to the possibility forusersto dispose of the filesthey buy in
this manner(e.g. by selling themor by giving them as a gift).
The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right
applies in the case of the distribution ofphysical copies (e.g.
when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,
the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of
that tangible article)27

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)28

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale.While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to
avoidre-sellers keepingand usinga copy ofawork afterthey have
“re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and
delete” question) as well as to theeconomic implications of the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality
that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market
for physical goods).

[In particular if you arean end user/consumer:]Haveyou

YES–Please explainby giving examples

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you area right holder or a service provider:]
What would bethe consequencesof providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

Such a change in the law would contradict the InfoSoc-Directive
(see Recital 29) and extend the principle of exhaustion beyond
the distribution right in connection with tangible copies of
works to services in general. The consequence would be that the
right holder loses the means to control the creation of new,
distinct digital reproductions of the work which have to be
created for the resale of previously purchased digital content.

The concept of exhaustion in connection with physical goods does
not fit with the making available of digital services. This has
already been discussed by the CJEU in the case Oracle vs.
Usedsoft (C-128/11). The CJEU has also highlighted that such a
change in the law would be detrimental to the World Copyright
Treaty (par 60).

Besides such legal arguments against such a change in the law,
the result would also be uncontrollable in fact: whereas it is
fairly easy to control item-specific whether consent of the
right holder has been given in connection with traded physical
copies, it is impossible to control and enforce whether the
principle of exhaustion is lawfully applied to digital files.

In practice,I thinkthat such a change in the law would in fact
make it impossible in practice to fight online piracy. The
result would seriously undermine all business efforts of legal
digital service platforms which have started to develop well in
the EU in recent years. Therefore, from a global competitive
point of view, such a change in the law would seriously harm
the creative sectors in the EU.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good
idea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for theprotection and
exerciseofrights. However,this prohibition is not absolute29

For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e.works
originating inthe country imposing the formalitiesas opposed to
works originating inanothercountry.

.Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights.With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology
providesfortheuse of content(includingolder works and works
that otherwise wouldnothavebeen disseminated),the advantages
and disadvantages of a system of registrationare increasingly
being considered30

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office
forHarmonisation of theInternalMarket (OHIM)for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

YES

NO

NO OPINION

Frommypoint of view, voluntary registration systems at EU level
can lead to a considerably higher degree of transparency in
connection with the identification and the licensing of works
and other subject matter. Such registration platforms have
already successfully been established, eg the the International
Standard Audiovisual Number ISAN, which has become an
ISO-standard norm. Demand for such registration databases may
differ for various kinds of subject matter: In the audio visual
sector, due to the fact that all rights are likely to vest with
the movie producers, rights information can easily be traced by
professionals.

In such cases, registration databases are not required or, given
their costs, highly questionable. In any case, evidence is
required in advance to define which information shall be
subject to possible registration processes. This information
might differ considerably from the information collected by the
OHIM in connection with the database for orphan works cited by
the EU commission in footnote 30 of this questionnaire.

Yet it is crucial that no formality requirements are introduced
to copyright law in connection with such registration efforts
as they would contradict international copyright law. It has
been a huge achievement in the past to establish copyright
protection internationally independent from formality or
registration requirements.

What would bethe possible advantagesof such a system?

[Open question]

Such a system couldachieve greater transparency and make
licensing agreements faster and easier.

What would bethe possible disadvantagesof such a system?

[Open question]

Such databases need to be current and therefore updated
permanently, are costly, have to meet high security criteria in
order to reduce risks of abuse and might give too much weight to
registration and formality requirements, thereby misleading the
creators in the first place and putting off small and
independent creators. Registration in such databases needs to
be informal yet complete, cost-free and the persons filing
registrations need to guarantee that they are entitled to
provide information and that the information is correct.

Given the unprofessional handling of the new website and
registration processes by the OHIM recently, which has caused
great frustration amongst professionals, it has to be doubted
whether the development of official registration databases is a
good idea.

As some registration databases, based on private initiatives
exist, egwww.eidr.org, confusion might also be inevitable.
Therefore, it might be better if the EU Commission leaves the
creation and administration of such databases entirely to the
market which will develop adequately if sufficient demand
exists. The EU Commission should therefore focus on supporting
the existing databases.

What incentives forregistrationbyrightholderscould be envisaged?

[Open question]

Easy to access, free of charge, transparency, easy to adapt,
supplied in a wide range of flexible technical formats.
Incentives must not be connected to copyright privileges as
this would contradict international copyright law.

How to improve theuse andinteroperability ofidentifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed31

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33

You will find more information about this initiative(funded in
part by the European Commission)on the following website:
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of
rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

I think thatsupport for the named identifiers in the content
sector to be better approaches than registration databases
which are subject to questions 15. to 18. of this
questionnaire.

To my mindimproved and linked identification systems can support
right owners in the audio visual sector and increase
transparency and reliability of data. This has to go hand in
hand with increasedsupport for all databases which have already
been created by various stakeholders in order to improve
interoperability on an international scale. Such identification
systems should focus on being as freely and flexibly accessible
as possible.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national
rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35

Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the
death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
in the digital environment?

YES – Please explain

The current terms are a good and sustainable compromise and
have, therefore, been recognised worldwide in international
conventions.A shortening of terms of protection would be
inacceptable, also from a human rights point of view. It would
also contradict the EU commission’s recent successful
activities to extend the term of protection in connection with
sound recordings. In this context shall be added that the
OHIM’s recent study on the relevance of IP-protection for the
EU economy highlighted that copyright-intensive industries
contribute 4.2% to the EU’s GDP.

The question which needs to be raised here is: who would benefit
from a shortening of terms of protection of copyright protected
subject matter? In truth, only industries whose business
concept is built on exploiting copyright protected content
without contributing to creating new content. In the long run,
the shortening of the terms of protection would do nothing but
devalue the worth of creations and intellectual property. It
would be detrimental to the interests of the EU and the welfare
of its citizens to do so.

NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use
for illustration purposes of an extractfrom a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). At EU level theyare established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive2001/29/EC36

Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of
databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon the legal protection of
computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and
lending right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37

Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994;
Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty
(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.

Whereas thecatalogueof limitations and exceptions included
inEUlawis exhaustive(no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonised at EU level)38

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption ofDirective 2001/29/EC(see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions areoftenoptional39

With the exception ofcertain limitations: (i)in the Computer
Programs Directive,(ii) in the Database Directive,(iii) Article
5(1) in theDirective 2001/29/ECand(iv) the OrphanWorksDirective.

,in the sense thatMember Statesare free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.Moreover,the
formulation of certain of the limitations andexceptionsis
general enough to give significantflexibility totheMember
States as to how,and to what extent,toimplement them (if they
decide to do so). Finally,it is worth noting that not all of
the limitationsand exceptionsincluded in the EUlegal framework
for copyrightare of equivalent significance in policy terms and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the
Single Market.

Inaddition, inthe same manner that the definition of the rights
is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of
the Member State), the definition of the limitations and
exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is
covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require
the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40

Only theexception established in therecent Orphan Works
Directive(a mandatory exceptionto copyright and related rights
in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be
located) has been givena cross-border effect, which means that,
for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is
considered an orphan work in a Member State, that same
novelshall be considered an orphan work in all Member Statesand
can beused and accessed in all Member States.

.

The cross-bordereffectoflimitations andexceptionsalsoraises the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.In some
instances,Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders
for theharm inflicted on them bya limitation orexceptionto
their rights. In other instancesMember Statesare not obliged,
butmay decide,to provide for such compensation.If a limitation
or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were
to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for
illustration in an online course given by an university in
a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B")
then there would also be a need to clarifywhich national law
shoulddeterminethe level of that compensation and who should
pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member States regulatoryframework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EUcopyright directivesare
optionalfor the Member States?

YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

NO – Please explain

The impact of the harmonisation of limitations and exceptions
according to the InfoSoc-Directive has taken time, but become
more and more evident: based on the jurisprudence of the CJEU,
especially the interpretations of key provisions of the
directive including the application of the three-step test.
Therefore, the system of limitations and exceptions is more and
more practiced in aharmonised way in the EU. The Member States
make increasing use of their competences according to the
directive. This serves the goal of the internal market. It is
self-understanding that the different traditions of copyright
in many member states cannot be overcome too quickly and the EU
system of harmonizing on the basis ofdirectives takes time.
Modifications of limitations and exceptions at this stage
require careful analysis and key evidence in order not to
impede the current harmonisation process.

NO OPINION

Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so,
is there aneed for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

YES–Please explain byreferringto specific cases

NO–Please explain

There is no reason nor is there a justification for such a step.
The principle of subsidiarity has to be respected.Moreover,the
current legal frame is sufficient and provides the flexibility
required in the current harmonization process.

For the sake of completeness,I would like to addthat the
frequently discussed “fair use”-doctrine as practiced in the
USA is a legal concept not compatible with the current EU
copyright system: the concept is built on massive case law
which has developed over many decades. Its application would
complicate the harmonization process taking place in the EU by
introducing a new, complex and alien concept. Therefore,I
amagainst any initiative with the goal to introduce it in EU
copyright law.

NO OPINION

Should any newlimitations andexceptions be added toor removed
fromthe existing catalogue?Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

[Open question]

There is no need to add or remove limitations and exceptions
to/from the existing catalogue. The existing catalogue reflects
a good compromise at EU level. It has been accepted and
continues to be acceptable by all parties.

Independently from the questions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES – Please explain why

NO – Please explain why

Providing Member States with more flexibility on limitations and
exceptions is not necessary because they already enjoy a
sufficient degree of flexibility.

NO OPINION

If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g.interpretation by national courts and the
ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by
the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a
fair-useor fair dealingprovision / open norm, etc.)?Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

As said before, the EU legal framework on copyright provides
Member States and stakeholders with sufficient flexibility
while providing for the necessary degree of harmonisation.

As already mentioned in the response to Q 22,I thinkthat the
frequently discussed “fair use”-doctrine as practiced in the
USA is a legal concept not compatible with the current EU
copyright system: the concept is built on massive case law
which has developed over many decades. Its application would
complicate the harmonization process taking place in the EU by
introducing a new, complex and alien concept. Therefore,I
amagainst any initiative with the goal to introduce it in EU
copyright law.

Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your
experience,constitute a problem?

YES–Please explain why andspecify which exceptions you are
referring to

NO–Please explainwhy andspecify which exceptions you are

NO OPINION

In the event that limitationsand exceptionsestablished at
national level were to have cross-border effect, howshouldthe
question of “fair compensation” be addressed, whensuch
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

[Open question]

The member states should be free to decide whether the fair
compensation schemes in place currently shall remain in their
territory. Right holders’ income shall not be weakened by any
attempts to further harmonize limitations and exceptions in the
EU.

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive2001/29/EC enablesMember Statesto reflect in their
national law a rangeoflimitations andexceptions for the benefit
of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and
museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these
exceptionsallow actsof preservation and archiving41

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

andenable on-site consultation oftheworks and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42

Article 5(3)nof Directive 2001/29.

. The public lending(under an exception or limitation)by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questionsarise as to whetherthe current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needsto be considered here.

Preservationand archiving

held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films)– the restoration or replacement of works, the
copying of fragile works -mayinvolvethe creation ofanother

States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing
for the making of such preservation copies.The scope of the
exceptiondiffersfrom Member State to Member State(as regardsthe
type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-mattercovered by the exception, the mode of
copyingand the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make).Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

The online consultation ofworks and other subject-matter

E –lending

Traditionally, public libraries haveloanedphysical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to
organisesuche-lending activities. In various Member States,
publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with
different business models for the making available of works
online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by
publishers or bundling byaggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to
efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to
digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections
and, normally, to make them available to the public. Examples
are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part
of the 20thcentury or whole collections of pictures of
historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisationand making available of out
of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the
normal channels of commerce),which isaimingto facilitatemass
digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the
basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar
cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting
societies representing authors and publishers on the other44

You will find more information about his MoU on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

.Provided the required funding is ensured(digitisation projects
are extremely expensive),the result of this MoU should bethat
books that are currently to be found only in the archives of,
for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available
online to everyone.The MoU is based on voluntary licences
(granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of
the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some
Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect ofsuchlicences (e.g. by establishing in
legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting
society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the
licences granted)45

Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46

Article 5(3)aof Directive 2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national
legislationlimitations and exceptionsfor the purpose of
illustration fornon-commercialteaching. Such exceptions would
typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to
illustrate his course,e.g.by distributing copies of fragments
of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by
showing protected content on a smart boardwithout having to
obtain authorisation from the right holders.The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather
different implementation at Member States level.The
implementation of the exception differs from Member State to
Member State, with several Member States providinginsteada

educationaluses. Some argue that the lawshould provide for
better possibilities for distance learningand study at home.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51

For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data
mining” will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation
from the right holders for the making of such copies unlesssuch
authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general
public without restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of thisis clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52

See the document “Licences for Europe – tenpledges to bring more
content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a
subscriptionagreement and considered that a specific exception
for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the
basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
“user-generated content”. While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53

A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph.Other
examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in
a blog.

. User-generated content (UGC) can thus coverthe modification of
pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work
does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from
merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing
content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity
is not “new” as such. However, the development of social
networking and social media sites that enable users to share
content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities
and increased the potential economic impact for those holding
rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the
preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With
the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is
open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with
regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and
the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensuswas reachedamong participating stakeholders on either
the problems tobe addressed or the resultsor even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, awide range of viewswere
presentedas to the best way to respond to this phenomenon.
Oneviewwasto say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC,
in particularnon-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Anotherview wasthat no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the usersgenerating thecontent. In any
event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and
facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54

This is not just a problem of remuneration. This type of
use/adaptation also concerns the moral rights of authors and is
therefore subject to their authorisation.

Right holders observe though that works of others based on their
own pre-existing works are frequently monetized, not only on
platforms like Youtube, but also on other notoriously and
structurally infringing websites. Youtube provides remuneration
schemes for users uploading material including such which is
based on pre-exisitng works. The pre-upload procedure does not
sufficiently control the ID of uploaders and does not deter
infringing uploaders from illegal activity: in fact, the
registered user remains anonymous. Even if blocked, it is very
easy for him to be registered again with a slightly different,
in fact anonymous ID to repeat his infringing activity. Youtube
intentionally takes this infringing practice into account.

application of limits of provider liability rules in accordance
with the jurisprudence of the CJEU would be a solution.

As traditional media are usually obliged to produce European

all.

Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations to the
reproduction right for copies made for private useand
photocopying55

Article 5. 2)(a) and (b)of Directive 2001/29.

.Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically
used forsuch purposes(blank media, recording equipment,
photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4
players, computers, etc.) with a viewtocompensating rightholders
forthe harm they suffer whencopiesaremade
withouttheirauthorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use)
orthrough use of certain technique (i.e. reprography).In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files by
consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 fileandgoes on
tostoremultiplecopies of thatfile(in her computer, her tablet
and her mobile phone) -alsotriggers, or should trigger,the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases,these leviesmay indeedbe claimedby
rightholderswhetheror notthelicence feepaid by the service
provideralready covers copies made bythe enduser.
Thisapproachcould potentially lead to instances of double
payments whereby levies could be claimed on top ofservice
providers’licencefees56

Communication "Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in
Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António
Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies.Youcan consult these recommendationson the
following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/130131_levies-vitorino-recommendations_en.pdf.

.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as
personal lockers or personal video recorders.

In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
scope and application of theprivate copyingand
reprographyexceptions58

Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

in the digital environment?

YES–Please explain

NO–Please explain

The relevant provisions which are contained in the Directive
2001/29 are sufficiently clear while leaving enough flexibility
to theMemberStates.

Morover, The CJEU has already provided decisive interpretation
regarding the scope and application of these exceptions
(C-467/08 – Padawan, C-462/09 – Opus, C-457/11 – Kyocera,
C-521/11). Further judgments are awaited soon (eg C-435/12 –
ACI Adam). Under these circumstances, the CJEU provides the
guidance required in the process of harmonization on EU level,
including contemporaryunderstanding of the storage media to
which these exceptions and levies in this context apply. The
national courts follow this guidance, even if it takes time
until cases dealing with these issues are finally decided.
Initiatives of the legislator are not required and would only
disturb the ongoing harmonization process.

Over the years a successful system of remuneration of authors
has been established in Austria which is firmly built on the
private copy levy system. Additional obligatory legislative
tools are likely to harm this system.

NO OPINION

Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in
the context of a service that has been licensed by
rightholders, and where theharmto the rightholder is minimal,
be subject to private copying levies?59

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies

 YES – Please explain

It is unclear which basis the European Commission assumes that
the harm rightholders face in connection with digital copies
made for private purposes from licenced sources is per se
minimal. This assumption also contradicts the CJEU’s
understanding in the Kyocera case (C-521/11) and the VG Wort
case (C-457/11-C-460/11) and that cumulative economic effects
of acts of countless private internet users who are not
connected with each other need to be taken into account (see eg
C-607/11 – TVCatchUp). In fact, the number of private copies has
increased dramatically with the new digital media and has also
led to a much higher level in consumer comfort. This justifies
substantial private copying levies.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

How would changes in levies with respect to the application
toonline services (e.g.services based oncloud computing
allowing, for instance, usersto have copieson different
devices)impactthe development and functioning ofnewbusiness
modelson the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]

The Vitorino report ignores in this context that the licencing
of new business models and private copy levies cover totally
separate ways of use of the works. The CJEU has made this
explicitly clear (eg Kyocera case, C-521/11). New business
models building their success on content produced by third
parties should have to honour the creator’s interest with a
fair share and compensation. Also, the end users should
contribute to the convenience gained with such a model to use
the creations of third parties. In a legal system with a fair
balance of rights, it would be unjust

-if such new business models would not be required to have to
take the rights of third parties they rely on into account and

-if the end users’ practice would not be mirrored in private
copy levy income of the creator as practised in many countries
today.

Moreover, there is no any evidence that existing levies are a
barrier to the development of new products and/or on-line
services, as there is no discrepancy in the development of such
products orservices between Member States where a private copy
legislation exists and is implemented, and Member States where
no exception or remuneration is implemented.

Would you see an added value in making levies visibleon the
invoices for products subject to levies?60

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies.

Divergingnational systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles tothefree
circulation of goods and servicesin the Single Market.At the
same time, many Member States continue to
allowtheindiscriminate application of private copying levies to
all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levyis sold(e.g. private person or business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments61

between private and commercial users.About one third of all
blank media in Austria (including hard discs) are used by
commercial entities. Cross-border transactions are no issue
since any importer and direct seller of blank media in or to
Austria has to pay the levy. The importer or direct seller may
obtain reimbursement of a foreign levy from that Member State,
in accordance with the Amazon ruling. Due to their permanent
increase, direct sellers should be subject to better control
and enforcement by the collecting societies, in order to fight
abuse and circumvention of the private copying regimes.

Fairremuneration of authors and performers

TheEUcopyrightacquisrecognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to producers62

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract63

See e.g.Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC,Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

. Thisis an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches.Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

[In particular if you arean author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?

I would like to highlightthat question 72 does not refer to
producers and therefore excludes a highly relevant group of
right holders.

The real challenge is to develop an online policy which gives
the online market the freedom todevelop so that the online
platforms themselves are able and responsible for the
development of the financing and development of productions in
order to realise a return in investment which is worthwhile. An
obligatory remuneration via a levy on EU level would impede such
a process and would directly harm the economically instable
online distributors in smaller EC Member States.

Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

YES–Please explain

NO–Please explainwhy

There is no need to act at EU level: contracts vary from sector
to sector, and so do national rules from one Member State to
another. It does not appear to be necessary to harmonise these
rules in any more detail, as no problems have occurred in
practice and the principle of subsidiarity should prevail.

Different from other EC Member states, minimum wages which are
binding for movie producers have been agreed in a binding way
akin to a state statute. This mechanism guarantees that all
persons contributing to a movie are adequately paid. Legal
instruments intervening in this system have to be made us of
very carefully and are not necessary frommypoint of view.

NO OPINION

Ifyou consider that the current rules are not effective, what
would you suggest to addresstheshortcomingsyou identify?

[Open question]

As mentioned above, there is no need to act at EU level:
contracts vary from sector to sector, and so do national rules
from one Member State to another. It does not appear to be
necessary to harmonise these rules in any more detail, as no
problems have occurred in practice and the principle of
subsidiarity should prevail.If needed, they can more easily be
adapted at national than at EU level, while respecting the
general framework of the EU copyright Directives.

Respectforrights

Directive 2004/48/EE64

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text65

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement
measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for
copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose66

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time,there could beclarification of the
safeguardsforrespect of private life and data protection for
private users.

Shouldthe civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

YES–Please explain

It is not clear how the term “commercial” is to be understood.
The European Charta of Human Rights and international copyright
law demand an efficient, proportionate and effective enforcement
of copyrights regardless whether the infringer acts for a
commercial purpose.

Discrimination is only justified when it comes to the
consequences of copyright infringement: eg in Austria,
commercial copyright infringements can be prosecuted criminally
and not only in civil litigation.

A discrimination differentiating between more and less effective
enforcement cannot be accepted. It would also make practice more
complicated, as the InfoSoc-Directive does not harmonise moral
rights. The suggested approach would lead to a gap between
enforcing the rights which are harmonised on EU level and the
ones which aren’t. The notion to improve enforcement in general
for all right holders regardless whether the infringement has
any commercial background or impact is seen positive.

NO–Please explain

NO OPINION

In particular,isthe current legal framework clear enough to
allow forsufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
online copyrightinfringements with a commercial purpose? If
not, whatmeasureswould be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

[Open question]

The current legal system is rightly based on a responsibility of
intermediaries (see Art 8 (3) InfoSoc-Dir). In various
countries, this provision has not been implemented though, eg
in Germany. This leads todiverging jurisprudence in the Member
States. An improvement for the benefit of right holders could
be achieved if their legal means to identify and locate
commercial scale infringers could be extended. In practice,
data protection rules make such identification and localization
impossible, in particular in Austria.

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the
right balance is achieved between the right to have one’s
copyright respected and other rights such as the
protectionofprivate life and protection of personal data?

YES–Please explain

The jurisprudence of the CJEU has given all required guidance
for national courts to achieve a fair and proportionate
weighing up of the interests of all the parties involved.

NO–Please explain

A single EU Copyright Title

The idea ofestablishing aunifiedEU CopyrightTitlehas been
presentin the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only manner in which a truly Single Market for content
protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe
that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing
a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?

YES

NO

From my point of view, there is no need to impose on all Member
States an identical copyright law.The codification of the
current EU copyright directivesisof more relevance than the
establishment of a single EU copyright title. The latter would
be premature and, as a parallel copyright system, unnecessarily
complicate copyright management and enforcement in the whole EU.
I amagainst introducing such a concept.

NO OPINION

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in
the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member
State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

I think thatthe continued, more and more harmonized application
of the EU copyright acquis seems the more pragmaticand
realisticapproach.

Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive
consultation on the most important matters relating to the
current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could
bring them to our attention, so they can be properly addressed
in the future.

Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal
framework forcopyright?Pleaseexplainandindicatehow such matters
should be addressed.

[Open question]

To my mindthe following matters should be addressed:

-Support for a better, faster and stricter enforcement of
copyright claims, implementing the CJEU’s and ECHR’s standards
for effective copyright enforcement.

-Obligatory contribution of new media and providers to the
financing of the content they build their business case on

-Clearer regulations to control market dominating and
oligopolistic players, especially of US platforms on the EC
market: exactly such platforms have to bear responsibility for
European content.

-Creative Europe: creation of specific support (eg for audience
building) for specific European online initiatives, online
platforms with European content or national online platforms
with a European focus.

- Effectuating European quota for non-linear media

-Extending the responsibility of the provider industry to fight
copyright infringements and reduction of the possibility for
illegal online services to generate income based on advertising
turnover.

-Bundling of rights vesting with the producer also in relation
to broadcasters, in particular a reversion of rights in the
interest of the exploitation of archives.
