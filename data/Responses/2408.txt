RE: Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules.

Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP), an initiative of the International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC), appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Public Consultation on the review of the
EU copyright rules.

The massive infiltration of counterfeit and pirated goods creates an enormous drain on the global
economy – crowding out billions in legitimate economic activity and facilitating an "underground economy"
that deprives governments of revenues for vital public services, forces higher burdens on tax payers,
dislocates hundreds of thousands of legitimate jobs and exposes consumers to dangerous and ineffective
products. For business, these effects lead to greater risk, lower returns on investment, less job creation
and in the extreme, market exit.

ICC BASCAP unites the global business community across all product sectors to address issues
associated with intellectual property (IP) theft and to petition for greater commitments by local, national
and international officials in the enforcement and protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).

ICC BASCAP welcomes the opportunity to provide comments to the Commission regarding the public
consultation on the review of EU copyright rules. We will not be providing a detailed response to the full
questionnaire, but would like to highlight the following overarching issues that we believe are important in
considering how best to achieve an effective copyright regime whilst delivering the digital single market.

Significant to European jobs and economy
                                                  1
The September 2013 report from the Observatory showed that IPR intensive businesses generate more
than a quarter of employment and a third of economic activity in the EU. It confirms ICC's longstanding
position that IP and IP rights drive economic growth, investment and employment, and underpin vibrant,
innovative and growing economies.

The copyright system is fundamental to a hugely diverse set of creative businesses, which account for 510
billion euro of value added to GDP and employ over 9 million people in Europe. Copyright intensive
industries are net exporters to the tune of 15 billion euro, against an overall EU trade deficit of 170 billion
euro.

We understand that in parallel with this consultation the Commission is undergoing an impact assessment
of possible review measures. We urge the European Commission to consider the impact that any
measure would have on growth and jobs in Europe, including on enforcement against copyright
infringement. As long ago as 2008, digital piracy was causing €10 billion of damage and losses of more
than 185,000 jobs in Europe—and has continued to grow with greater and faster access to the Internet
                      2
over the last 6 years. This represents an enormous drain on the economy, crowding out billions in
legitimate economic activity and acting as a barrier to entry for new services.

A complex area that requires proper analysis and reliable evidence
The Commission questionnaire contains over 80 questions on highly technical and important parts of the
copyright framework. We believe that responses to these questions require proper analysis and reliable

evidence, something not possible to deliver in the short consultation period. In reviewing responses and
conducting further research, we encourage the Commission to take the time needed to achieve this and
not to rush to proposals based on artificial time constraints caused by institutional renewals.

Retain the current flexibility
The current copyright framework enables licensing of works across the member states of the union on
market terms and gives them flexibility to adapt the application of exceptions in their territory to local
tradition and needs, within the confines of the 3 step test. As was clear from “Licenses for Europe”, all
creative businesses are seeking to reach the widest audiences through new digital channels. When
services choose to roll-out on a country-by-country basis, this is often due to a strategy that reflects the
diversity of European culture and markets. Evidence must be carefully analyzed to understand if the root
cause of any perceived issue is in fact related to the territoriality of copyright and its exceptions or to other
economic, cultural or linguistic causes.

Before any new exceptions are considered, their necessity (including why they would be preferable to
licensing solutions) should be established on the basis of clear evidence and sound economic analysis.
This analysis should, in particular, look at the extent of the perceived need in terms of quantity of potential
users across Europe in relation to the impact on the market, and for example whether there is any market
failure which cannot be fixed without changes to legislation. To date no such problem or market failure has
been identified.

Implement the current rules, involve intermediaries
There are still areas of the current EU acquis that are not properly implemented in many member states,
notably article 8(3) of the copyright directive. Implementing current rules should be a priority, especially
given the positive experience from member states that have fully implemented the directive.

The Commission should look carefully at whether intermediaries in the online environment are playing
their part in denying the abuse of their legitimate infrastructure as part of a whole community response to
piracy.

We are not aware of any evidence that a single copyright code is either needed or desirable. We agree
with the UK government that with so many individuals and businesses reliant on and affected by copyright,
and with so many contentious issues at stake, it would be unwise for the Commission to rush into any
changes of the scale or ambition of a single copyright code. A reform on this scale would increase
complexity and uncertainty for many years at a time of rapid and critical change.

We look forward to continuing to work closely to develop a robust framework that supports the growth of
dynamic creative businesses in a thriving European digital economy.
