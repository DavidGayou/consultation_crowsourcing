   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?

related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22
May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society (hereinafter ‘Copyight Directive’) does
not specify what is covered by the making available right.


Therefore when the assignment covers several territories it is not clear
where the act of making available takes place in order to define which
national law is applicable and which national courts are competent.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


It is clear that the making available  right  can  be  compartmentalized  in
different territories under agreements with third parties.  In  our  opinion
no further regulation of the matter is required


€ NO OPINION








Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights").


The application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in
the online environment creates legal uncertainty and represents an added
obstacle for companies looking to launch their business online.


In order to launch an online business, a company must obtain the right of
reproduction and the right to make the works available to the public. Given
that platforms include multiple works by a variety of authors and/or
performers, companies usually have to negotiate with both production
companies and collecting societies prior to the release date.


In countries such as Spain, collecting societies manage compulsory licences
for the public communication of works in the online environment. Users are
required to pay fair compensation for making works available on online
platforms (e.g for audiovisual works). In the case of compulsory licences,
no distinction is drawn between the right of reproduction and the right to
make works available to the public. Since there is a legal obligation to
pay remuneration for the public communication of works, collecting
societies claim that they hold a “universal repertoire” of works and
authors, thus providing the user with a blanket license for its business.
Users are assured that they have no need to worry about the right of
“reproduction” and that no other association or society from a different
country will seek additional payment from them.


However, where there is no such legal obligation to pay fair compensation,
users must acquire both the right of reproduction and the right of making
available (e.g.for musical works). This causes confusion and makes it more
difficult for users to obtain the appropriate rights, above all when the
author has reserved such rights or has appointed an association to manage
them (such as CELAS, at an EU level).


In short, applying two rights to a single act of exploitation makes it more
difficult for users to obtain the necessary rights to launch an online
business in the EU.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception).


In view of the broad definition of  copyright,  subjecting  hyperlinking  to
the authorization of the  rightholder  would  obviously  modify  the  normal
functioning of the Internet (linking lies at the heart of the Internet)  and
would in many cases also affect the right  to  information  and  freedom  of
speech.


We would argue, except in the cases indicated by the ECJ (European Court  of
Justice) in the Svensson case, that the provision of  links  should  not  be
considered an act of  reproduction  subject  to  the  authorisation  of  the
rightholder since it is  not  an  act  of  exploitation  of  the  work.  The
hyperlink is not the work. By hyperlinking to the  work,  the  work  is  not
reproduced or communicated to the  public.  The  hyperlinking  is  merely  a
sequence  of  letter,  numbers  and  signs  (e.g  www.link.com)  and  not  a
reproduction or communication of the work.


In conclusion, we would argue that hyperlinking to  a  work  should  not  be
deemed an act of exploitation of the work. Otherwise, important rights  such
as the right of information and freedom of speech and the  whole  notion  of
the Internet itself would be severely jeopardized.

or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)


The imposition of this legal requirement would have a major economic  impact
on the Internet if each website view were subject to  the  authorisation  of
the rightholder.


We would argue that browsing should not be deemed to constitute  an  act  of
exploitation or that, if it were, it should be expressly covered by  one  of
the following copyright limitations:


(i) temporary/ transient copy reproduction and/or (ii) private use defense:


-Temporary/transient  reproductions:  The  Copyright  Directive  (Art.  5.1)
provides for a limit on copyright  for  temporary  reproductions  which  are
transient  or  incidental  [and]  an  integral  and  essential  part  of   a
technological  process  and  whose  sole  purpose  is  to  enable:   (a)   a
transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary,  or  (b)
a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made,  and  which  have
no independent economic significance.  Such  cases  are  exempted  from  the
reproduction right provided for in Article 2.


However, the CJEU (ECJ Infopaq Decision, July  16,  2009,  Case  C5/08)  has
taken the restrictive view that, in order to  apply  his  exemption,  copies
must be deleted from the memory of the device and  the  recordings  must  be
necessary for the completion  of  a  technological  process  (a  restrictive
interpretation of such exemption  is  also  made  by  the  ECJ  Decision  of
October 4th, 2011,  paragraph  162  regarding  the  memory  of  a  satellite
decoder).


Consequently, under current legislation, it is not clear whether or not  the
display of data as cached data (whenever such  data  is  stored  within  the
memory of the system) is covered by the limits to copyright under Art. 5.1.


-Private use defense: Additionally, the Copyright Directive [Art.  5.2  (b)]
provides for a limit on copyright in respect of reproductions on any  medium
made by a natural person for private use  and  for  ends  that  are  neither
directly nor indirectly commercial, provided the rightholders  receive  fair
compensation, which takes account of the applications or  otherwise  of  the
technological measures referred to in Article  6  to  the  work  or  subject
matter concerned.


It is not clear whether or not  this  limit  on  copyright  applies  to  the
recording of content in the cache memory of a user’s computer.


To sum up, we would argue that the viewing of a website (where this  implies
the temporary reproduction of a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected
under copyright on  the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  users
computer) should not be deemed an  act  of  copyright  exploitation  or,  at
least,  should  be  covered  by  either  of  the  aforementioned   copyright
exceptions. Otherwise, the whole notion of the  Internet  will  be  severely
jeopardized and further development of the Internet, as we know it, will  no
longer                                                                    be

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


The registration of works  for  copyright  protection  is  surely  a  tricky
question across different EU jurisdictions.  Luckily,  within  the  European
Union the different legislations share the same principles  which  pave  the
way for a future centralisation of the effects of having a  work  registered
with a potential registration system at EU level.


In this sense, the creation of a registration system  would  have  immediate
consequences for authors as to having their works protected  throughout  the
European  Union.  Since  the  protection  of  intellectual  creations  is  a
discipline to be fostered by governments, the  creation  of  a  registration
system  at  EU  level  would  reinforce   that   protection   by   extending
territorially  the  protection  of  intellectual  creations,   and   thereby
reassuring authors.


From the various effects that registration of works  has  for  rightholders,
the one enhanced to a greater extent with this EU registration system  would
be information about the registered works  being  publicly  available.  With
the current  system  based  on  national  registers,  it  is  difficult  for
stakeholders to get to know if a work has been registered with the  national
registration system of a different member State.


Furthermore, a registration system available to the  public  which  reflects
the transfer carried out on the rights of a specific work could  potentially
save time and costs related to legal disputes.


Likewise,  setting  up  a  sole  registration  system  at  EU  level   would
significantly reduce the costs and time spent  in  registering  works.  This
would make management of copyright easier for the different stakeholders  to
the matter.


Additionally, a sole registration  system  at  EU  level  would  help  fight
against piracy issues. For instance, if an  author  has  registered  his/her
works with a national registration system of a member  State  but  not  with
other  member  States'  national  registration  systems  it  might  be  very
difficult for him/her to hold legal disputes in every Member State where  an
infringement  has  been  committed.  However,  if  that  author  can  easily
register  his/her  works  with  the  sole  registration  system  across  the
European Union, the  costs  and  time  related  to  the  legal  dispute  may
probably reduce.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


The creation of a registration system at EU level could  bring  some  issues
up related to the different regulation  of  some  aspects  of  copyright  in
common law countries and in civil law countries.


Differences like the existing as to the protection  of  rights  on  software
may certainly hinder the creation of a  useful  registration  system  at  EU
level, since common  law  countries  normally  permit  the  registration  of
software as opposed to countries as Spain, which does not.


The prior would entail that the effects of the  registration  system  at  EU
level would have  to  be  restricted  to  the  ones  that  registering  with
national registration systems currently  has.  Therefore,  the  creation  of
such a registration system at this stage  of  regulation  would  add  little
change to the current situation regarding  increasing  the  effects  of  the
registration.


As a conclusion, the disadvantages of the creation of a registration  system
at EU level are reduced to the problem of the subject as a  whole,  unifying
copyright law across the European Union.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


As long as the registration system extends  the  territorial  protection  to
cover every European Union member State, third countries rightholders  would
feel increasingly attracted to expanding their businesses  in  the  European
Union. This would take us to a win-win situation: rightholders are more  and
better protected when approaching the European  Union  market  and,  at  the
same time, the European Union enhances its Single Market.


Enforcement possibilities for stakeholders would increase considerably  with
a single registration system at EU  level.  In  this  regard,  it  would  be
advisable to avoid reproducing the current system in  place  for  trademarks
and patents with both national and EU registration systems.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain

Private copying is one of the hottest topics regarding IP and the problem
behind the copying levies is economic.
It simply does not match and creates legal uncertainty and greater
imbalances and distortions than the ones it tries to solve.
In our point of view the levy system is out of control as historic
definitions allow unlimited claims from collecting societies leading to an
unreasonable and unjustified accumulation of levies for consumers and
industry.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[59]

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


Digital copies made by end users (alone or with the help of  third  parties)
for private purposes from a licenced service should  be  considered  subject
to the private copy exception, but they should not be subject to levies,  if
the harm caused to the right holders is considered minimal.


For that purpose, we believe that the concepts of “private  copy  exception”
and “minimal harm” should be clarified at EU level. Regarding  the  “minimal
harm”, firstly a more clear definition of “harm” should  be  construed  and,
secondly, the situations when such  harm  should  be  considered  “minimal”,
shall also be defined, in particular, in the case of digital copies.


In the event that digital copies made by end users caused  a  minimal  harm,
those private copies should not be subject to private copying levies.


In the event that this harm is not minimal, digital copies shall be  treated
as analogic copies and, therefore, collected by collecting societies.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]


Business models based in cloud computing intend to  provide  an  easier  and
more efficient access to digital content by end users, from  every  location
and through any devices and means of transmission.


Imposing levies to the copies of  content  made  in  the  context  of  those
business  models  shall  take  into  account  possible  obstacles   to   the
development of such models.


On the one hand, such levies should never be unfair. On the other hand,  the
collecting of such kind of levies shall  always  be  at  European  level  to
avoid negative effect in competitiveness with regards to  European  business
models, in itself,  and  as  compared  to  other  providers  from  different
regions of the world.


Copying levies should never cause a price  increase  which  will  limit  the
attractiveness, competitiveness and future development  of  business  models
based on new technologies. The purpose of any new legislation in this  field
should be to eliminate barriers to the development of digital businesses  in
Europe, instead of creating any more difficulties.

  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[61].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.

Yes, there are always obstacles relating copyright levies within the
exploitation of digital works through digital services.

For a free movement of works in any cross-border transaction, such
obstacles should be avoided and, in that sense, any duplicate payments of
the same levy should be removed.

  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning

level.


Such actions could be, among others, the following:


- to achieve an unified definition of “copyright levies”


- to achieve an unified definition of “minimal harm”


-  to  develop  a  multi-territorial  or  pan-European  licence   with   the
collecting societies, including an unified tariff system.


- to achieve more transparency regarding the collecting societies system.

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

Spanish legislation on  intellectual  property  are  sufficient  since  they
regulate both  administrative  processes  with  performance  of  the  Public
Administration  subject   to  judicial  review,  and  civil  processes  that
establish mechanisms to compensate damages of infringements in this issue  [

In this context, it should be  noted  that  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the
European Union once again highlights  the  critical  role  of  the  national
courts  for  the  realization  of  substantive  aspects  of  the  protection
measures of Intellectual Property Rights, as indicated in  paragraph  38  of
the recent statement that ask " the national court "  to  compare  different
types of technological  measures  that  protect  the  intellectual  property
rights of holders. In other words, in this respect , the  interpretation  of
the Court of Justice of the European Union is considering  that  current  EU
rules are appropriate to protect rights-holders , but  that  should  be  the
responsibility of the national courts to determine the  form  of  protection
according to European and national law application . [Judgment of the  Court
of Justice of the European Union January 23, 2014 (Case C 355 /12) ].


Finally , regarding the role of intermediaries mentioned in the preamble  of
this section [“One means to  do  this  could  be  to  clarify  the  role  of
intermediaries in  the  IP  infrastructure”],  we  are  satisfied  with  the
warning comment 67 (“this clarification  should  not  affect  the  liability
regime  of  intermediary  service   providers   established   by   Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which  will  remain  unchanged”)  In  any
case, any European and / or national measure  in  this  matter  must  ensure
that the "principle of proportionality  "  is  fulfilled  as  the  Court  of
Justice of the European Union exposed in “Judgment  of  the  Court  (  Grand
Chamber) of 29 January 2008 (Case C 275 / 06)”:


“68. That being so, the Member States must, when transposing the  directives
mentioned above, take care to rely on an interpretation  of  the  directives
which allows a fair balance to be struck  between  the  various  fundamental
rights protected by the Community legal order.  Further,  when  implementing
the measures transposing those directives, the  authorities  and  courts  of
the Member States must not only interpret their national  law  in  a  manner
consistent with those directives but also make sure that they  do  not  rely
on an  interpretation  of  them  which  would  be  in  conflict  with  those
fundamental rights or with the other general principles  of  Community  law,
such as the principle of proportionality (see, to  that  effect,  Lindqvist,
paragraph  87,  and  Case  C  305/05  Ordre  des  barreaux  francophones  et
germanophone and Others [2007] ECR I 0000, paragraph 28).”

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

YES. We believe that the current legal framework around ISP´s  liability  is
sufficient to protect the different rights and interests of  actors  in  the
chain. The IPRED Directive has proved a sound instrument and should  not  be
re-opened. The legal system should neither  permit  nor  encourage,  on-line
intermediaries to indiscriminately eliminate any material from the  Internet
upon receipt of any virtually notice  from  third  parties.  This  situation
will unduly threaten freedom of expression and fair competition.


The limits on liability as laid down in the eCommerce  Directive  have  been
fundamental to the growth of the Internet and its  associated  services,  as
it allowed users to communicate in confidence.


Moreover and although the topic is not directly related with  this  question
we would like to raise as a major concern the higher cost of  implementation
that ISP’s are  being  required  to  carry  around  the  issue  of  internet
blocking. For example, the legislation in UK does not  address  this  issue,
and the Courts have taken the view that such costs are “part of the cost  of
doing business as an ISP”. Given that we are neither the rights  holder  nor
the infringer this seems disproportionate,  and  as  Court  applications  in
this area increase so will the cost burden.


In our opinion the cost of the blocking measures should  be  transferred  to
the owner of the right. In this sense, in case C-314/12 confronting the  UPC
Telekabel telecommunications company with Constantin Film Verleih  GmbH  and
Wega Filmproduktionsgesellschaft GmbH, the  EU’s  General  Attorney  of  the
Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has stated that, depending  on
its  complexity,  cost  and  duration,   a   specific   measure   could   be
disproportionate, it should  be  valued  if  it  possible  to  achieve  such
proportionality, transferring some or all of its cost to the  owner  of  the
rights.”


As other example we can mentioned de Dutch case  blocking  measures  carried
out by ISPs (apart from expensive and hard to implement) are easy  to  elude
if citizens keep demanding this kind of contents. In  this  case  the  Dutch
Supreme Court has overturned an order for major Internet  providers  to  ban
access to  the  file-sharing  website  “the  Pirate  Bay”,  considering  the
measures imposed back in 2011 as ineffective and disproportionate.


In  the context of disclosure of customer details pursuant to a Court  Order
(where such customers are alleged to have infringed  copyright)  the  rights
holders seeking access to such information in UK have been required to  make
a contribution  towards  the  ISP’s  costs,  although  the  time  burden  on
employees in complying has been considerable. We are strongly  of  the  view
that any  step  towards  agreed  processes  in  this  area  (such  as  those
envisaged under the UK Digital Economy Act) must strike a fair  balance  and
not place undue burdens on ISPs.


Regarding all the previous explanations, we would like point out that  there
are other factors which make people try to consume digital  contents  in  an
illegal way and which should be face and solve by regulators.  For  example,
people demand content that the industry is not able to offer either  because
of the timing when content is available to them or by other reasons such  as
the price of the contents or the difficulties they face to  give  access  to
that content (interoperability problems).  Therefore,  we  should  highlight
that a proper offer that could be adapted to  people´s  changing  demand  is
the best way for bringing piracy down. Spotify  is  a  perfect  example  for
that

  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


We consider that the current civil enforcement  framework  is  adequated  to
balance the intellectual property rights and the privacy rights.


However, we  support  initiatives  to  develop  a  co-operational  framework
between the intermediaries and the judicial authorities within the  European
Union,  for  the  prevention  and  persecution  of  copyright  infringements
provided that such collaboration remains within the scope of the  exceptions
from liability established in the  eCommerce  Directive  and  of  the  legal
restrictions established in the national  legislations,  including  but  not
limited to privacy and data protection legislation.


Finally, we believe it would desirable to harmonise the rules on injunctive
relief against intermediaries in accordance with the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights, in particular Articles 6, 7 and 11 of the Charter,
under the application of Article 52. In this regard, it will be prudent to
expect that the Court of Justice of the European Union to rule on these
rights cases pending completion (C 293/12, C 594/12), since it will
influence the subject matter of

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

The copyright legislative framework should  be  flexible,  so  that  it  can
facilitate digital development and new disruptive business models  bases  on
innovation. The regulation should not be an  obstacle  for  digital  economy
growth but a driving factor. As for this, the EU regulation  has  to  enable
EU enterprises to compete in fair conditions with non EU players assuring  a
level playing field for business models and  innovative  solutions  for  the
distribution of creative content.  The  legal  rules  should  be  clear  and
favourable for digital business.

Any harmonization of the copyright legislation that is designed to adapt  it
to the digital environment must  take  into  account  participation  of  all
parties involved in fostering the Digital Single Market. This should  extend
to authors, creators, rightholders, users and service providers  as  regards
theirs investment in new technologies. The EU regulation  should  take  into
account the new ways of  delivering  digital  content,  so  that  the  rules
should strike a balance between providing rightholders with a high level  of
protection and  the  development  of  innovation  in  the  digital  economy.
Illegal downloads on a large scale can  jeopardize  the  development  of  an
economically  viable  single  market  for  digital  content;  is   therefore
essential that legal offers can  evolve  in  order  to  strike  the  balance
mentioned above.

In this context, revenue sources  for  rightholders  should  be  ensured  to
contribute to the development of new business models and  the  evolution  of
the Digital Single Market.

Any  exceptions  that  have  an  impact  on  the  Single  Market  should  be
harmonised. This is a prerequisite for legal certainty  for  all  interested
parties.  This  should  not,  however,   preclude   future   exceptions   if
technological developments so require.

[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09

joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).

[27] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[30] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
