Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules
Please find the answers attached within the Public Consultation document attached below. The ques-
tions that have been answered – pertaining to problems encountered as an end user, as well as views on
on certain aspects of digital copyright – have been reproduced on the next six pages.
On the whole, while this process is welcome, it does not reach far enough. The question of digital copy-
right must be treated within a paradigm which takes into account both its special characteristica as well
as the scope and idea of the Single Market.



Yours faithfully
Kristian Benestad, LL.B.




                                                                                               Page 1 of 7
1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when trying to access
online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you live?
YES: Two different categories spring to mind: Music and film and TV content. Music, especially newer
or older music outside the “mainstream” that are available in one country may not be licensed outside
that territory.
TV broadcasts are often territorially limited even though the overwhelming content presented is ori -
ginal. A single song – e.g. a theme song – may be enough to restrict content to domestic use only, even
if only a fraction of downloads may originate from abroad. This is for example the case with program -
ming produced by public broadcaster NRK in Norway; while living in Denmark, where DR and TV2
held the rights, there was naturally a focus on showing e.g. Danish curling matches. The licensing agree -
ments meant that other countries national broadcaster were unavailable outside their own territory, in -
cluding broadcasts where there would be no net loss for the right holders to accept broadcasting outside
the broadcaster's natural territory.
Netflix is another service, where some films are not available in Scandinavia, but is in the UK and Ire -
land – while films that are available in several regions only carry subtitles in the region's language. I.e.
German-language films available both in Scandinavia and the UK and Ireland, do not carry English
subtitles in Scandinavia, even though they are clearly available to Netflix.
7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solu-
tions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
YES: Licences granted per territory makes little sense where the conveyance of information is dependent
on a system which does not discriminate on a territorial basis. In instances where the content is tied to a
tangible media per copy – e.g. a book or a DVD – territorial licensing makes sense as content is con -
trolled by means of controlling copies. Such a method of controlling the spread of content does not in-
terfere much with the idea of a single market, as it is the production of the copies themselves that gives
rise to the duty to pay royalties, not the subsequent reselling.
In the digital marketplace, however, access replaces the copy as the mean to control the spread of con -
tent. As both the control method and infrastructure is wholly different, new regulations are needed. Re -
lying on mechanisms designed to cope with individual physical copies in a world where access to a cent -
ral copy is key is not only unwise and reactionary – it also goes against the very idea of the Single Mar -
ket, which is why a central regulation of copyright is needed.
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is dis-
seminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
NO: The court has reached a natural decision when considering the rather muddy terrain it is operating
in. Going forward however, it may be hard to keep this definition. Consider a business in Ireland, offer -
ing its services in English and priced in Euro. Advertisements are bought online and placed on random
websites including sites in other EU countries, including the UK. The company receive interest from
other countries, including articles in trade magazines, etc., further increasing customer flow from out -
side countries without the company actively seeking publicity in these countries.
Where does the company need licence agreements in order to stay within the boundaries of “targeting”?
In Ireland only? In Ireland and the UK, as English-speaking countries? In Ireland and the other Euro
countries, or in Ireland, the Euro countries and the UK?


                                                                                                  Page 2 of 7
In order to stay “out” of certain markets, primitive measures such as blocking certain IPs may be imple -
mented, although they are neither secure nor able to keep out VPN connections masking as a connec-
tion from a different country.
Digital delivery of content does not only enable delivery to any computer with internet access; on the
server side, statistics may show exactly who buys what when from where. This is a possibility licensing
societies ought to have seized long ago; as they haven't legislation might be the only way to tap into this
potential.
11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?
NO: As noted by the first line in this paragraph, hyperlinks are references. They merely tell you the loc -
ation of where material can be found, and the link provides an instruction to the browser to fetch in-
formation, if clicked.
Hyperlinks are integral to a hypertext document. While they do communicate to the browser an in-
struction as to where and how to fetch the information, they merely make the act of fetching this in-
formation easier by telling the browser where and how, and enabling the user to go directly to the con-
tent. The present wording, which only pertains to hyperlinks, but not non-linked information, would
create an absurd situation where <a href=”http://www.http://ec.europa.eu/”>ec.europa.eu</a> would re-
quire authorisation, but ec.europa.eu alone would not – even if they both lead to the same site.
Due to this – and hyperlinks referencing nature, which can not in itself infringe a right holder's right in
any way on its own – hyperlinks ought not to be subject to right holder's authorisation.
12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or
other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the
user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?
NO: All content that is accessed online must necessarily be reproduced in one way or another on the
end user's machine. This is a technical limitation of the medium, and, as such, ought to be excepted
from copyright coverage.
13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when trying to re-
sell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
NO.
15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing
of works and other subject matter?
YES.
16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
A registration system would make it much easier to identify copyrighted works, and should also include
notices of public domain / “less-than-copyrighted” work referenced in the new work. Also, for digital
content the content itself could be stored, making it easier to police possible transgressions.
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
A registration system would require a database authority to be established, and would likely incur costs
for those registering.

                                                                                                 Page 3 of 7
18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
Works that have been registered in the database ought to enjoy a speedier way of enforcing their copy-
right claims.
19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sec-
tor, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?
The EU ought to ensure that entry barriers to such databases are as low as possible, such as not to ex -
clude any groups – whether they are artists without a major label backing them, or come from poorer
countries.
20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
YES and NO. In the digital environment, content creation is cheap. That is why a comprehensive over-
haul, which takes the different forms of intellectual property, into account when deciding on appropri-
ate terms. A web application and a novel – the former a type of content which does not change over
time, and the latter a type of content which may change rapidly – are very different, and ought as such
to be treated and protected differently.
28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in
your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by librar -
ies, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
        31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
It is in the Union's best interest that works are available for research throughout the Union. Hence it
should encourage – but not direct – educational institutions and right holders institutions to cooperate
on making works available through one or several centralised outlets in an affordable way for all institu-
tions regardless of which Member State they may be located in.
This is especially important when it comes to preserving access for institutions in “fringe” territories, as
well as preserving access for materials published in a “fringe” language.
32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,
including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof ) for purposes of research and
private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when
trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections
of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional
users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the
works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
        35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Off-site access is an issue that is best resolved by the parties themselves.
47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experi-

                                                                                                  Page 4 of 7
enced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the context of re -
search projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of research projects/activit -
ies, including across borders?
YES: Many legal journals and databases are walled gardens, where accessing premium content often is
restricted to a single database only – i.e. few attempts at consolidating search in several databases at
once. In instances where such search are facilitated, a lack of standardisation makes results unreliable.
48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
These problems require the organisations behind the journals and the databases to understand the im -
portance of common standards. In the field of law it might be too much to ask for a common standard
for citations for example; a problem which may be solved by introducing a machine-readable standard
instead.
49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research pur-
poses? How successful are they?
In Denmark, the State Library (Aarhus) and the Royal Library (Copenhagen) both offer on-site, and in
some cases off-site, access to most mainstream databases. While this means that most needs are cur -
rently covered, more specialised access may be difficult to obtain.
53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experi-
enced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods, including
across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copy-
right, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from
the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content, including across bor-
ders?
        55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
        Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Data mining is an integral part of the internet as we know it – without it, there will be no search en-
gines. However, it is clear that the present state is not sustainable. Search engine companies may make
good money off the back of actual content creators – even if content is not displayed, this content is still
helpful in building up databases over different types of content, its presentation, etc.
It is clear that some form of either fair compensation or perhaps profit sharing is necessary. On the
other hand, repercussion must be available in order to penalise actors who refuse to follow industry
standards (such as robots.txt), as well as implementing mechanisms for right holders to manage their
content available in search engines.
56. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
See above.
57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of text or data
mining methods?
Robots.txt (rightly so).

                                                                                                  Page 5 of 7
60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you experienced
problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for users
publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through
your service?
63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
User Generated Content present a whole set of problems that does not fit neatly within the current
copyright framework. Users' knowledge of copyrights, protection, thresholds, et. al. is often low, remu -
neration schemes are close to non-existent, and works are rarely identified. Coupled with a prevalent be -
lief that “content should be free”, it is clear that this kind of content needs a different approach.
Most probably some thresholds must be established which allow users some leeway within the scope of
copyright (e.g. where the original content creator could not realistically expect that a derivative work
would be made), while services that are profiting off such content compensate right holders by contrib -
uting towards a right holders' fund, similar to the copy fees levied by some countries on cassettes and
CDs.
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private
copying and reprography exceptions1 in the digital environment?
YES. Within the Single Market there ought to be a single approach to copyright – and this includes the
scope and application of private copying and reprography exceptions. The digital environment is fur-
thermore a new environment, and as such deserves to be treated different that physical media.
65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?
NO. Where the harm to the right holder is minimal, the private individual ought not to compensate
the rights holder. I am unsure whether there should be a general fund, funded by levies on e.g. broad-
band subscriptions, cloud storage and portable music players to compensate right holders in the same
manner copy levies have been used, but in my opinion this would (a) run contrary to the new content
model (where content and medium is separate), and (b) only enhance the general feeling that content
should be offered free of charge and as such diminish the actual value of content.
67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to
levies?
YES. If end users are to pay extra for the right to reproduce otherwise copyrighted content this must be
presented clearly to the end user, for example by specifying the levy on the invoice.
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of
copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
YES. The enforcement of intellectual property infringements is currently left to the Member States,
which may make it harder for right holders to pursue their rights abroad. A mechanism similar to either
the current unitary patent or the new union patent ought to be established so that right holders may
present their case once despite the infringements' cross-border characteristica.
77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of

                                                                                                Page 6 of 7
private life and protection of personal data?
NO. As enforcement is left to the individual Member States, there may be differing standards between
the States. As long as there is no single standard, the “right” balance can not be said to have been
achieved in 27+ jurisdictions.
78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of estab-
lishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?
YES.
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
A unified Copyright Code within the union should absolutely be the next step. The protection terms
(death+70 years) are likely to be an even bigger obstacle than the differences between Member States' le-
gislation – while legislation may be harmonised, it may be harder to get stakeholders to accept the chan -
ging circumstances.
80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright? Please
explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The current regulations governing copyright date back to the 1800s, with the general framework being
even older. This framework was specifically set up in response to technological change and the develop -
ment of society. Applying the same century-old framework to new technology is an unfortunate devel -
opment. Instead of trying to fit technology which first surfaced in the 1970s and 80s into an already
outdated framework, right holders, technology developers and politicians must work together to create
a new framework.
The only similarity between digital output and current copyright legislation is content – however, while
the production methods have shifted from expensive printing presses to cheap-to-no-cost computerised
creation and reproduction methods, legislation has not changed. This has led to the peculiar situation
where software programs, including web applications are covered by copyright afforded literary works.
Few people would categorise Wuthering Heights and webmail applications together, but for copyright
purposes they are the same kind of works.
This discrepancy needs to be addressed on a broad basis where all parties recognise what the technology
shift means. A comprehensive review and a resulting copyright code need to build on the realities we're
facing today. As a new start, it should take into consideration that copyright is not only an agreement
between a rights holder and an end user, but also a tool to encourage innovation and growth. As such, it
is necessary to make sure that the different categories and terms of protection are appropriate, as well as
encouraging use and re-use while at the same time simplifying enforcement options throughout the
union. Also, some legal consideration must be given to the new concepts of sharing and creation, which
is especially prevalent within the code community, where much software is being published under more
lenient licences with a multitude of creators and rights holders.
