   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


As an RRO we grant licenses for secondary uses in our country and abroad  by
virtue of the mandates we have from our members and rightsholders.

      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]

   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples

The copyright holder is at  liberty  to  limit  the  scope  of  the  mandate
granted to the RRO, including limitations on the  basis  of  territoriality.
The RRO would respect such limitation of the mandate.

Rights  administration  by  RROs  of  certain  secondary  uses  of   already
published works is often supported by national legislation. This could  take
the form of a legal licence, a  remuneration  right,  or  the  extension  of
licensing agreements concluded on the basis of exclusive rights  to  include
works of non-mandating authors and publishers. Such extension by law  is  in
most  cases  limited  to  national  territories,  the  exception  being  the
licensing of the use of orphan works, which may be extended to cover all  EU
Member States.

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ X NO – Please explain

In the text and image sector, current legislation is of no hindrance to  the
development of  multi-territorial  solutions.  This  is  also  confirmed  in
documents from  the  European  Commission  (EC)[16].  Commercial  users  can
generally ask for permission to use a work directly from  the  publisher  or
author and obtain it on a contractual and up to  worldwide  basis.  Equally,
RROs are used to administering rights for secondary uses across  borders  on
the basis of different legislation and models of RRO operation.  Rights  for
foreign authors  and  publishers  are  generally  administered  through  the
network  of  bilateral  agreements  between  RROs.   The   IFRRO-recommended
Repertoire Exchange Mandate (REM) for digital  licensing  by  RROs[17]  does
not impose any territorial limitations.

As noted by the EU Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston in her  Opinion  (case
C-351/12)[18], typically in the EU, CMOs operate (whether  by  virtue  of  a
statutory or de facto monopoly) within the  territory  of  a  single  Member
State and may be required to accept as members any rightholder  resident  or
established within that  State.  In  such  cases,  they  monitor  and  grant
licences to users within the same Member State. A user may obtain a  licence
for a repertoire managed by a CMO established in  another  Member  State  by
means of reciprocal arrangements  between  CMOs,  each  of  them  acting  on
behalf of the other(s)  within  its  own  territory.[19]  The  principle  of
copyright territoriality has also been reconfirmed in the Court  of  Justice
of the European Union’s (CJEU’s) “Premier League” case (C-403/08)[20].

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[21]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[22]
and databases[23].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[24] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[25],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[26].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[27]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


X YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[28])

€ NO OPINION




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[29])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[30]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[31] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

Hyperlinks are essential tools for online content delivery and form  a  part
of the communication process. Specifically, where a hyperlink  is  comprised
of or includes text protected as the whole or part of a copyright work  (see
The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd &  Ors  v  Meltwater  Holding  BV  &  Ors
[2011] EWCA Civ 890), the ‘provision’  of  a  hyperlink  would  involve  the
making available of  the  whole  or  part  of  a  copyright  work.  In  such
circumstances, the authorisation of the rightholder  would  be  appropriate.
This is especially  relevant  to  the  provision  of  paid-for  services  to
business  users,  which  would  otherwise  substitute  for  services   which
currently generate important income streams for content owners.

We understand the purpose  of  the  question  as  being  that  of  providing
relevant user access to copyright works. There are licensing  mechanisms  in
place to enable legal user access, so there is no reason to exempt  the  act
of hyperlinking to a  copyright  work  or  other  subject  matter  from  the
requirement of rightholder authorisation. This view was  also  held  by  the
District Court of The Hague  when  it  ruled  in  the  case  of  Buma/Stemra
against  the  operator  of  radio  streaming  websites  ‘Nederland.fm’   and
‘Op.fm’, that a website, which is  embedding  or  linking  to  radio-streams
without a licence, infringes copyright[32]. Nevertheless,  not  all  linking
should necessarily be made subject  to  authorisation.  There  might  be  an
implied licence to link in a loyal manner to other websites, as long as  the
material that is being linked to has been made available  with  the  consent
of the copyright holder.

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why

Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to  an  authorised  act
should not require additional consent from the copyright holder.  This  does
not mean that all “cache” memory copies are to be considered “temporary”  or
strictly “incidental” ones. The facts of the case need to  be  analysed  and
that is best left to the courts.

Technological development has had  the  effect  that  copyright  content  is
increasingly viewed or listened to (“streamed”)  through  computer  browsers
rather than by the making  of  downloaded  copies.  The  increasing  use  of
streaming is documented, for example, in a report  prepared  for  Ofcom[33],
which tracked digital behaviours and attitudes among persons  aged  12+,  in
the United Kingdom. The report noted that the incidence of streaming  of  TV
programmes was  much  more  common  than  downloading  (33%  for  streaming,
compared to 9% for downloading). Streaming services are one variety of  “on-
demand” service,  which  is  specifically  referred  to  in  Recital  10  to
Directive 2001/29/EC as requiring protection.

It would not be compatible with common sense  of  justice  that  essentially
the same act – making a copy of the monitoring report  for  the  purpose  of
reading its content – should  not  require  a  licence  in  one  case  (when
accessed online), while it does in the other (when accessed by  e-mail).  If
viewing and streaming were not subject to  rightholder  authorisation,  this
anomaly would exist in the online environment generally, where  the  problem
of piracy is notorious.

Accessing the same content by the easy alternative of visiting  the  website
of an unlicensed website (claiming to avoid the payment of  a  licence  fee)
obviously  conflicts  with  the  normal  exploitation  of  the   works   and
unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the  copyright  holders,
thereby infringing the three-step test  in  international  conventions  that
the EU Member States are party to, as  well  as  Article  5(5)  of  European
Union Copyright Directive (EUCD). The computer user deliberately  creates  a
copy of the work on his computer screen. It is his very purpose  in  opening
his browser and going to a webpage for a book or article,  and/or  streaming
a sound recording or film. The end user must therefore be obliged to  obtain
a licence to access the underlying work. This does not prevent a  user  from
reading,  viewing  or  listening  to  content  that  has  been  made  legaly
available on the web with the consent of the copyright holder.  Any  further
use is, however, subject to authorisation or licensing.

€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is  or  should  be
covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[34].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[35].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

The creation  of  a  legal  framework  enabling  the  resale  of  previously
purchased digital content would have many  negative  business  effects.   If
users were to be allowed to sell e-books or articles of the same quality  as
the initial copy, and without wear and tear, it  could  eventually  lead  to
the destruction of (parts of) the  primary  market.  This  risks,  in  turn,
impacting  negatively  on  the  EU’s  foreign  relations,  given   that   EU
publishers would be less  interested  in  making  low-cost  digital  content
available in countries that cannot afford to pay the full EU price. 

From the perspective of rightholders,  by  confirming  the  possibility  for
sole owners  of  a  digital  copy  to  invoke  successfully  the  exhaustion
doctrine,  this  might  incentivise  the  drafting  of  relevant  terms  and
conditions as mere rights  of  use,  rather  than  transfers  of  ownership.
Licences, purporting to grant rights of  use  without  conveying  ownership,
would likely become more prevalent. 

Large scale digital retailers, Apple and Amazon, have both obtained  patents
for systems of resale for digital  items[36],  which  indicates  that  these
retailers may be thinking about setting up their own marketplace or  lending
library for  the  transfer  of  user-owned  digital  content.  Unless  these
marketplaces allow original content creators to benefit from the  resale  of
their  goods,  reduced  earnings  prospects  could  seriously   reduce   the
creators’ incentive to create.

The ownership of digital files and  the  possibility  of  their  resale  are
linked  to  the  application  of  the  principle  of   exhaustion   to   the
distribution of tangible copies of works.  The  answer  provided  by  CJEU’s
case law in the Oracle vs. UsedSoft decision, Case C-128/11[37], is  limited
only to the specific case of software.

According to the German Regional Court of  Bielefeld,  the  CJEU’s  UsedSoft
decision is not applicable to the resale of other digital content.[38]  More
specifically, the German court held that,  because  of  the  nature  of  the
Software Directive 2009/24/EC as lex specialis to Directive 2001/29/EC,  the
reasoning in UsedSoft could not be applied to other subject-matter. In  this
vein, the Landgericht Bielefeld concluded that the EUCD does not permit  the
application of the principle of exhaustion to works in non-analogue form.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[39]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[40].

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be
made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. A registry could be established on a voluntary basis.
The possible advantages of registration, provided it is established on a
voluntary basis, include the identification and proof of rights and the
facilitation of copyright licensing. However, authors and publishers cannot
be required or expected to monitor notifications in the EU and its Member
States. Also, in the print sector, there are already identifiers being used
to identify the text, the publication and the author and publisher, in the
form of the ISO standard identifiers ISBN, ISSN, ISTC, ISNI and DOI.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[41], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[42]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[43]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[44] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Identifiers  are  crucial  for  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of   CMO
operations. EC-sponsored projects such  as  ARROW  and  ARROW  Plus  include
references to the desirability of using international  identifier  standards
such as ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier, ISO  27729)  and  ISTC
(International Standard text Code, ISO 21047).  This  could  be  facilitated
by the transposition of ISO 21047 and ISO 27729 into European standards.

EC support could also be given for  projects  to  populate  vital  databases
being  used  by  EU  Projects  with  agreed  international  standards.    In
particular the TEL (The European Library) database, used also for the  ARROW
project, could be funded to acquire ISNIs and ISTCs, for the free  use  also
by other databases, such as those of CMOs and Books in  Print.  There  is  a
need  for  CMOs  to  be  able  to  use  such  standards  to  optimise  their
distribution  activities,  as  required  under  the  EU  CRM  Directive.   A
feasibility study is desirable to see how the international  standards  ISNI
and ISTC can be interfaced with the  private  databases  of  the  CMOs,  for
instance, in the text and data field, so that distribution  of  revenue  can
be better automated. Such a study could be financed, totally  or  partially,
by the European Commission.

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[45]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X YES – Please explain

Whether the  environment  is  digital  or  analogue  is  irrelevant  to  the
question of term of protection. IFRRO sees no need for a change of the  term
of copyright at this stage.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[46].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[47].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[48], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[49],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[50].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain

The European Union model is based on the various legal and other models  and
traditions of its Member  States.  They  vary  substantially  and  encompass
those of civil and common  law  countries.  This  poses  challenges  to  the
European Union but it also represents its strength.

There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory exceptions and  limitations
would have led to a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen by  the
EU,  based  on  optional  exceptions  and  limitations,  combined  with  the
development of practical  solutions  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  enhance
harmonisation, when required  and  appropriate.  To  the  contrary,  it  has
allowed European countries to play “a major part in  shaping  a  modern  and
balanced system of IP rights which not only guarantees innovators their  due
reward but also stimulates  a  competitive  market”,  as  noted  by  António
Campinos, the President of the Office  for  Harmonization  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM), and Benoît Battistelli, the President of the European  Patent
Office (EPO).[51] It has also  allowed  Europe  to  take  the  lead  in  the
development of innovative solutions, such as Viber, Skype and  Spotify,  and
enabled that European “IPR-intensive industries account  for  more  than  56
million jobs, or 26% of total employment, in  the  EU”  compared  with,  for
instance, 19% in the U.S.[52]

Moreover, copyright legislation remains but one of several elements  in  the
package that makes up  the  framework  for  the  creative  industries  on  a
national basis. The mix of elements is carefully chosen to address  national
requirements and traditions.  Flexibility  can  only  be  built  on  general
principles, which  leaves  implementation  to  the  Member  States  and  the
parties concerned. In the field of copyright, exceptions and limitations  in
national legislation are subject to compliance with the three-step  test  of
the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD Article 5.5,  and  adapted  to  the
special needs and legal  and  other  traditions  of  the  individual  Member
State. In the EU, this general principle is combined with  a  mandatory  and
several optional  exceptions  and  limitations.  We  do  not  see  how  more
detailed norms on a Community level could  serve  the  purpose  of  improved
access  to  copyright  works  or  enhanced  competitiveness  in  a  changing
technological and media environment.

Any further  limitations  or  exceptions  would  cause  a  serious  risk  to
publishers’ existing business models and to the development of  new  digital
business models. This would ultimately lead to a threat to  the  publishers’
ability to continue fulfilling their  democratic  mission  in  society,  and
also place media diversity at risk.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


X NO – Please explain

In accordance  with  our  response  to  Question  21,  we  do  not  see  any
particular issue with the optionality of exceptions and limitations  in  the
EU Directives. There does not seem to be a need for existing  exceptions  to
be made mandatory. Flexibility is important to  ensure  that  the  copyright
framework matches the needs of the individual Member State. Those needs  may
vary from one Member State to the other.

€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

Rather than considering whether to remove or add to the  current  exceptions
and limitations focus should be on the implementation of the  existing  ones
and stakeholder solutions developed on the basis of them. Examples  of  such
stakeholder-driven solutions, which still need to be fully implemented,  are
the ARROW[53]  system  to  facilitate  rights  information  management,  the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Key Principles on the Digitisation  and
Making Available of  Out-of-Commerce  Works[54],  and  the  EU  Stakeholders
Dialogue Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on  access  to  works  by  people
with print disabilities[55]. Also, we see a need for  the  EU  to  adopt  an
overarching policy on Intellectual Property (IP).
  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why

      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

In  general,  in  respect  of  licensing  by  RROs,  the  territoriality  of
limitations and exceptions does not  constitute  particular  problems.  User
requests related to rights administered  by  RROs  are  to  a  large  extent
confined to uses and users within the territory of the headquarters  of  the
national RRO; demands for  cross-border  or  multi-territory  licensing  are
limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on  the  basis  of  the  current
models of operation.


Nonetheless,  some  clarification  of  the  territorial  scope  of   certain
limitations may be appropriate. Rights administration by  RROs  for  certain
secondary uses of already published text and image  works  is,  in  most  EU
Member States, supported by legislation, with the result that the  scope  of
the agreement signed between the RRO and the  user  (which  is  normally  an
institution, corporation or organisation), or  the  rights  administered  by
the RRO, comprise also works of non-mandating authors and  publishers.  RROs
authorise  the  posting  of  works  to  internal  networks  (intranets)  for
strictly  internal,  personal  and  not  directly  commercial  use,  Virtual
Learning Environments (VLE) and cloud computing. Internal networks  are  not
always confined to territorial borders. Provided that the RRO  concerned  is
sufficiently  representative  for  the  works  concerned,  and   under   the
condition that that there is an opt-out possibility, it may  be  appropriate
to clarify  that  limitations  referred  to  above  apply  to  the  complete
internal network covered by an agreement with the RRO, and for the  specific
uses and users authorised by it,  in  accordance  with  the  Member  States’
international  obligations,  national  legal   mechanisms   and   collective
licensing traditions


€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

With respect to rights administered by RROs, in situations as  described  in
Q26, remuneration must be paid by the  organism  that  signs  the  agreement
with/is authorised by the RRO, and the remuneration should be  collected  by
the RRO granting the authorisation or collecting the compensation. In  cases
of cross-border uses, the question of fair remuneration may raise  difficult
questions in this period of public deficits and, in particular, for the  big
linguistic areas


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[56] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[57].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[58].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Problem-solving depends on the type and character of  the  problem.  Without
specifying the problems the question becomes too  imprecise  to  provide  an
appropriate answer. However, in general, problems are  best  solved  through
licensing  arrangements,  whenever  appropriate,  and  through   stakeholder
dialogues.  Organisations   representing   libraries,   archives,   authors,
publishers and CMOs have a proven track record in developing  solutions  for
libraries and  archives  through  stakeholder  dialogues.  Examples[59]  are
principles for rights clearance and registries of orphan works  and  out-of-
commerce works; model licensing agreements for the making available of  out-
of-commerce  works  in  closed  and  open  networks;   the   Memorandum   of
Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available  of
Out-of-Commerce Works by libraries; and the development  and  deployment  of
ARROW to facilitate and reduce costs in rights information management[60].



  34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

  35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

The main challenge is the implementation of solutions already developed  and
made available.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

Libraries remain, also in the  digital  world,  important  institutions  for
readers. There is a difference  between  genres  of  publishing,  especially
between academic and  trade,  where  the  former  business  model  is  about
licensing 99% of the content to  academic  libraries,  and  the  second,  of
which libraries represent at best 5% of its revenues, which  means  that  in
most countries 99% of the publishers’ revenues are sales through  bookshops.
As selling access to copyright works, rather than  physical  copies,  is  an
essential part  of  the  business  model  in  the  digital  environment,  in
particular in trade-book publishing,  library  e-lending  will  more  easily
conflict  with  the  normal  exploitation  of  the  work  and   unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interest  of  the  rightholder.  Also,  it  may  no
longer be seen to represent a special case, and thus  easily  conflict  with
all three criteria of the three-step test in international conventions  that
EU Member States are party to.

E-lending from libraries can, and should, nonetheless, take  place,  on  the
basis  of  contractual  arrangements  with  copyright   holders   or   their
representatives. Arrangements already exist in  several  EU  Member  States.
Various models are  being  explored,  and  the  main  challenge  now  is  to
identify and communicate best practices on the range  of  models  that  best
serve the assortment of purposes.


One should also note that the e-book market  is  only  at  a  nascent  stage
(with 15% in the UK, but  between  2  and  3%  in  Germany,  France,  Italy,
Scandinavia and Spain and less than 1% everywhere else), and that  sales  to
consumers represent the majority of the trade-book market.


Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[61].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[62].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO OPINION

Some EU Member States have already incorporated legislation to enable  large
scale  digitisation  and  making  available  of  cultural  heritage  through
licensing. Whether EU or national legislation is  required  depends  on  and
can only be answered when the EC has made known its  proposed  solution  for
cross-border accessibility.

Principle 3 of the MoU ensures that,  in  case  the  scope  of  a  voluntary
agreement includes cross-border and/or commercial uses, the  CMO  may  limit
its licence of works  that  are  out-of-commerce  to  those  of  represented
rightholders. Also, a specific procedure should be considered  in  order  to
reach the rightholders who are presumed to be represented  and  whose  works
are used frequently or intensively. Subject to this, the  legal  presumption
should also apply to acts of use of the work covered by  the  licence  which
occur in a Member State which is not the Member State in which  the  licence
was agreed.

The  signatories  to  the  EC-facilitated  MoU  on  Key  principles  on  the
digitisation and making available of out-of-commerce works  agreed  to  call
“on the  European  Commission,  to  the  extent  required  to  ensure  legal
certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation  to
be enacted to ensure that  publicly  accessible  cultural  institutions  and
collective management organisations which  enter  into  a  licence  in  good
faith applying these key principles are legally  protected  with  regard  to
licensed uses of works of rightholders who have been presumed to  be  within
the scope of the licence.”

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[63]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

X YES – Please explain

The concept of  “illustration  for  teaching”  often  causes  uncertainties,
which can  also  result  in  litigation.  RROs  began  their  activities  in
response to requests from educational institutions for the  facilitating  of
large scale reproduction of chapters and  other  fragments  of  the  world’s
scientific  and  cultural  heritage  for  teaching  and  research  purposes.
Educational institutions continue to be among the main beneficiaries of  the
RRO services.

Lately,  there  are  educational  institutions  that   have   claimed   that
“illustration for teaching” includes multiple copying  and  other  forms  of
uses which have traditionally been authorised through agreements with  RROs,
or  made  subject  to  remuneration,  including  under  remuneration  rights
schemes. On  this  basis,  they  refuse  to  take  up  a  licence  with  the
appropriate RRO.

IFRRO understands the  exception  in  Article  5(3)(a)  as  being  a  narrow
exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it  reads:
to illustrate; which is far from being the  same  as  planned  producing  of
teaching  material.  The   underlying   rationale   for   the   concept   of
“illustration for teaching” is to cover minor acts of copying, for  instance
a teacher writing something down on the blackboard or  a  whiteboard,  or  a
student copying a passage of a text for  revision  or  exam  purposes.  This
understanding of the concept is in accordance with its wording  as  well  as
of the opinions expressed by the foremost experts on it.  Teaching  material
in whatever format, including multiple copying  for  classroom  use,  cannot
and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it would  definitely
undermine the normal exploitation of these works.

X NO

Textbook publishers take a proactive role in offering their books  in  paper
and digital formats to educational establishments.

€ NO OPINION


  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Clarification on both Community and national levels that  “illustration  for
teaching”  does  not  comprise  the  reproduction,  making   available   and
distribution of teaching material, such as in the form of arranged,  planned
or structured multiple copies for classroom  use,  compilations,  e-reserves
and the sort would be appropriate.  Such  access  to  works  is  offered  by
authors and publishers directly, or through rights  administration  by  RROs
and other CMOs.



  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?
Scientific  and  research  communities  already  make   extensive   use   of
individual  licensing  schemes  offered   by   publishers,   combined   with
collective schemes offered by  RROs,  also  for  online  use  of  works  for
teaching or research purposes.

RROs exist in virtually all Member States to offer legal uses  of  copyright
works that complements  licensing  by  authors  and  publishers.  Collective
schemes  administered  by  RROs  include  scanning   of   books,   journals,
magazines, etc., copying from electronic  carriers  and  Internet  downloads
for a variety of uses, including for  the  printing  out  of  a  hard  copy,
posting to internal networks accessible to  authorised  users  specified  in
the licence, inclusion  in  course  packs,  and  other  relevant  uses.  The
arrangements encompass and clarify the use of works  for  “illustration  for
teaching”. Examples of tools offered by RROs and other CMOs to  legally  use
copyright  protected  text  and  image  works,  also  for  education,   were
presented as a part of the result of the EC initiative Licences for  Europe,
WG2[64].

  45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under what conditions?

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

The preferred option is to encourage solutions and to  protect  market-based
offers by ensuring that: any limitation  for  the  benefit  of  teaching  is
limited to small parts; copies made  under  the  limitation  remain  in  the
hands of the teacher; rightholders are named and receive fair  remuneration;
certain  categories  of  works  can  be  excluded  from  the  limitation  or
exception;  educational  material  is  promoted  as  crucial  to   a   sound
education,   providing   cultural   vitality   and   economic    prosperity;
interoperability is an important  criterion  when  providing  for  e-reading
possibilities and/or e-reading material in education.

The EC’s and EU Member  State’s  support,  as  required  by  national  legal
traditions and requirements, to individual and collective rights  management
schemes would be appropriate  and  welcome.  Entering  into  individual  and
collective  licensing  schemes  offered  to  educational  establishments  by
rightholders and RROs is what provides the broadest and most adequate  legal
access to intellectual property to the teaching  and  research  communities.
In a fast changing world, where  technologies  move  with  an  unprecedented
speed,  regulations  do  not  have  the  ability  to  offer   the   required
flexibility. Licensing agreements do. They offer  comprehensive  tailor-made
solutions to access scientific and literary  works  to  meet  the  needs  of
educational institutions.  This  is  the  safest,  simplest,  fastest,  most
innovative, most convenient and most cost efficient way to  seamless  access
to high quality teaching material  from  multiple  authors  and  publishers.
What’s  more,  flourishing  local  cultural   industries   and   a   healthy
educational  system  with  broad  access  to  local  resources   contributes
significantly to the nation’s economy and employment.


Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[65]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate  the  use  of
      content for research purposes? How successful are they?
The use of copyright material for research purposes  is  commonly  comprised
in the licences offered by publishers. Training opportunities  for  teachers
and professors regarding the inclusion of digital content  in  the  national
curriculum,  in  addition  to  support  for  public  funding  for   academic
libraries, could be further promoted.



Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[66]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [67].

The Marrakesh Treaty[68] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?



(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or

in special formats, including across borders?

  52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility
      to content? How successful are they?
Publishers are increasingly publishing books in the e-Pub format, which  can
be directly converted  into  files  accessible  to  persons  who  are  print
disabled.[69] Those files can be sold to users directly or  to  institutions
serving the community of the print disabled.

Exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights in favour of persons  who
are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled, exist in  all  EU
Member  States.  Also,  RROs  administer  statutory  provisions   or   offer
licensing agreements to facilitate access to copyright published  works  for
those user groups.

The main challenge is linked to  the  cross-border  exchange  of  accessible
format copies. The WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published  Works  for
Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled,  will
undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the  cross-border  exchange  of
such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come  into  force
and be implemented in national legislation. Also, it  may  not  alone  solve
all challenges.

The licensing agreement offered by the UK RRO,  Copyright  Licensing  Agency
Ltd. (CLA), allows for the distribution of accessible format  copies  within
the EU[70]. The Austrian and  German  RROs,  Literar-Mechana  and  VG  Wort,
administer statutory licences  and  have  developed  solutions  for  certain
cross-border issues regarding material in the German language. IFRRO  offers
tools to its members,  which  also  address  the  cross-border  exchange  of
accessible format copies.[71] Furthermore, with  the  view  to  enhance  the
cross-border  exchange  of  accessible  format  copies,  IFRRO  participates
actively, with representatives of persons with print  disabilities,  authors
and publishers, in the EC-facilitated ETIN  (European  Trusted  Intermediary
Network)[72] and the WIPO-facilitated  TIGAR  (Trusted  Intermediary  Global
Accessible Resources)[73] projects on enhanced access to copyright works  by
persons with print disabilities.
Thus, there exist solutions in the market place, as well as initiatives  and
pilots that can be built further on. Their success in the  EU  is  dependent
on the willingness of the EC and the EU Member States to invest in them  and
also support financially the development of the required networks  that  the
stakeholders stand ready to establish and maintain.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[74] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[75].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

There are no  impediments  to  Text  and  Data  Mining  (TDM).  Authors  and
publishers are not blocking  access  for  TDM.  Rather,  they  are  offering
solutions, and, to this end, for instance, the International Association  of
Scientific, Technical and Medical publishers (STM) has  issued  a  statement
and a sample  licence[76].  Through  this  statement,  signatory  publishers
commit to granting the necessary copyright licences to permit the  text  and
data  mining  of  copyright-protected  works  and  other  subject-matter  on
reasonable terms for non-commercial scientific research purposes in the  EU.
They  will  work  with  rights  clearance  agents  as  necessary,  implement
licensing systems to facilitate  easy  “one-to-many”  rights  clearance  and
platforms, and continue  to  develop  relevant  technological  solutions  to
facilitate the access in an efficient way.

Licensing solutions exist  both  for  commercial  and  non-commercial  uses,
offered by copyright holders directly, or via collective rights  management.

  54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Q53 is presented in a way that it requires a  “No”-response  from  us.  This
does, however, not mean that there are no problems linked to Text  and  Data
Mining  (TDM)  from  the   side   of   the   copyright   holder   or   their
representatives.  The  main  ones  are  the  need  for  clear   and   agreed
definitions of text mining and data mining; right of  the  copyright  holder
to control access to their databases; protection against unfair  competition
linked to commercial exploitation of text and data mining; and the  lack  of
constructive dialogue with some key user groups,  in  particular  those  who
walked out of  the  European  Commission  Licences  for  Europe  stakeholder
dialogue initiative. The preferred way to solve  this  is  to  clarify  that
there will be no exception for TDM.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[79]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[80].

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

In the  digital  environment,  press  publishers  have  started  using  more
straightforward digital solutions to share their  content  legally,  and  as
widely as possible.[81]

Technology is being further developed to facilitate click-through  licensing
solutions for users. In particular, a cross-media,  multinational  coalition
of more than 40 partners from the media and creative  industries,  including
representatives of authors and artists,  are  working  together  with  their
standards bodies to establish automated and  semi-automated  communications,
based  on  identifiers  and  interoperable   metadata   standards,   between
rightholders and those who wish to use content[82]. Similarly, any web  user
creating new content, whether it involves  re-use  of  existing  content  or
not, should be able to  add  such  identifiers  to  enable  them  to  better
protect and potentially monetise their content.[83]

Also, a toolkit for licensing has been developed  within  the  framework  of
the Licences for  Europe  initiative,  in  its  Working  Group  on  UGC  and
Licensing for small-scale users of protected material (WG2). This  document,
which has been signed by EFJ, EPC, EVA, EWC,  FEP,  STM  and  IFRRO,  brings
together, for the first time, a range of licensing solutions, namely: 

- Solutions for the identification of rightholders, their  agents  or  other
representatives (such as CMOs) from whom permission can be sought; 
-  Solutions  to  give  users  information  about  licensing  and  licensing
conditions: how the licensing process works and what users  can  do  with  a
work under a chosen licence; 
-  Streamlined  one-click/click  through/accessible  and  easy   pay-per-use
transactional systems that make the licensing process quicker and easier. 


  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[84]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[85][86].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[87]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


X NO – Please explain

There is no need to change Articles 5.2 (a) and 5.2  (b)  of  the  EUCD.  In
particular, it must continue to be a  requirement  that  certain  exceptions
are only permissible if fair compensation is provided to the rightholders.

There is, however, a need for clarification that, in  respect  of  text  and
image levies, “rightholders” eligible for “fair compensation” comprise  both
authors and publishers.

€ NO OPINION


  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[88]

X NO OPINION

The CJEU decided in the VG Wort case (C-457/11 to C-460/11) that a  possible
consent by the copyright  holder  to  the  copying  of  his  work  or  other
protected material in the context of the exceptions or limitations  provided
for in EUCD Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair  remuneration  payable
under the exception. This means that remuneration  paid  to  the  author  or
publisher under a licence does not preclude receiving the fair  compensation
for the exception or limitation. Such copies may  therefore  be  covered  by
the levies.


  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

Where authors and publishers are remunerated for certain uses on  the  basis
of copyright levies, the device and  storage  medium  remuneration  is  also
payable if protected works are copied in  connection  with  online  services
(e.g. cloud computing).  That  is,  for  example,  the  case  if  works  are
downloaded from a cloud portal and stored on a PC or storage medium




  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[89]

X YES – Please explain

IFRRO has favoured the making of levies visible on  the  invoices,  both  in
the discussions led by the EC-appointed mediator António  Vitorino,  and  in
the levy working groups preceding those  discussions.  It  appears  to  make
sense, inter alia for reasons  of  transparency,  to  show  the  device  and
storage medium remuneration on the invoices.

€ NO – Please explain

€ NO OPINION


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[90].

  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

X YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate  the  percentage
of the undue payments. Please also indicate how a  priori  exemption  and/or
ex post reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


X NO – Please explain

In respect of text and image  levies,  the  refund  of  device  and  storage
medium  remuneration  in  the  event  of  export  takes  place  through  the
responsible RRO, without problems in the vast majority  of  cases.   On  the
other hand, there are substantial problems  linked  to  vendors  of  devices
based in another EU Member State refusing to pay the levy.[91]

EU regulations are required to ensure that, in relation to import/export  of
devices, there is no ambiguity with respect to the  obligation  to  pay  the
levy according to the tariffs and methods of the country of  destination  to
the RRO in that country. In this respect, it should also be  clarified  that
any dispute should be regulated in and in accordance with the rules  of  the
country where the levy shall be collected.

€ NO OPINION


  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
In  respect  of  text  and  image  (reprography)  levies,  the  question  is
irrelevant, as noted also in  the  report  from  the  EC-appointed  mediator
António Vitorino[92]. Unlike the scope  of  the  private  copying  exception
under EUCD Article 5.2(b), which is limited to reproductions  that  serve  a
specific purpose ("for private use") regardless of the type  of  device  and
method,  the  reprography  exception  under  EUCD  Article   5.2(a)   covers
reproductions on a specific medium (paper), using a  specific  method  ("any
kind of photographic technique"), regardless of its purpose,  which  may  be
for professional, educational, private and other uses.[93] This  means  that
the reprography levies cover both private and professional uses.

Consequently, when it comes to analysing the impact of  reprography  levies,
it is not relevant to make a distinction between  private  and  professional
uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a levy. Against  this
background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between sales  of  devices
in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are  permitted
by law in both the private and business spheres. The – unified – device  and
storage medium remuneration can therefore be justified  both  for  sales  to
private persons and sales to business end users.






  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?
We refer to our response to question  69,  which,  in  short,  states  that,
under EUCD Article 5.2(a), text and image (reprography) levies  also  covers
professional uses. Question 70 therefore becomes irrelevant in  relation  to
text and image (reprography) levies.






  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

A main problem is the tendency to mix private copying levies  and  text  and
image (reprography) levies, and to discuss the reprography  levy  as  if  it
were identical to private copy levies. This is not the case;  the  two  levy
schemes are  different  (see  question  69).  The  EU  could  contribute  to
clarification through sensitising EC officials  and  EU  policy  makers  and
institutions that text  and  image  (reprography)  and  private  levies  are
different, and ensure consistency in their dealing with  the  two  different
levy schemes.

Also, as mentioned under question 68, the obligation for  exporters  to  pay
the levy according to the rules of the  country  of  destination  should  be
regulated


   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[94] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[95]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

For secondary uses administered by RROs, fair compensation  is  ensured  via
the  RROs’  distribution  rules   and   the   requirement   of   appropriate
representation  by  both  authors  and  publishers  on  its  decision-making
bodies.

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[96] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[97].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[98]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[99].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION

Wider legal access  to  works  can  only  be  achieved  through  appropriate
mechanisms which include direct licensing  by  authors  and  publishers  and
collective  management  of  rights,  combined  with  financial   incentives,
protection  against  infringement  and  copyright   enforcement,   including
efficient combating of piracy and other forms of unauthorised  reproduction.
CMOs play an indispensable role  in  assisting  authors  and  publishers  to
enable wider legal access to  their  works  and  in  awareness  raising  and
enforcement of rights.

Moreover  copyright  infringements  through  internet  constitute  a  severe
threat to copyright, creators and copyright industries in general,  even  if
they are not committed with a commercial purpose. For example peer  to  peer
sharing to copyrighted works or illegal downloads of copyrighted  works  for
private purpose do render the legal offer-sale-distribution  of  copyrighted
works obsolete. Consequently effective civil enforcement  system  should  be
provided for all kinds of copyright infringements.


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
   Collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to address copyright
   infringement and enforcement issues  is  welcome.  The  Commission  could
   facilitate initiatives in this respect through financial contributions to
   awareness-raising  campaigns.  The  use  of  systems  to   inform   about
   authorised use (e.g. through search engines using the ACAP[100]) are also
   highly welcome and should be encouraged. These actions help in  enforcing
   contractual terms and preventing the networks from being used to infringe
   intellectual property.


   The Commission should establish  a  clear  and  safe  framework  for  all
   stakeholders that will enable ISP’s to disclose to the  copyright  owners
   the names and addresses of person that  infringe  copyright.  Furthermore
   ISP’s  should  be  obliged  to  hinder  access  toillegal  content   upon
   notification by rightholders.


   The Commission should also  encourage  the  investment  in  new  business
   models. The establishment of a sustainable legal  offer,  reflecting  the
   cultural diversity of the European written sector, can only take place in
   an environment ensuring the full respect of copyright and, therefore, the
   – financial – independence  of  creators.  Against  this  background,  we
   request that the Commission maintains  a  stable  and  predictable  legal
   framework, promoting its rationale and its enforcement by all players.


  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


€ NO OPINION

The right balance of protection of copyright with other fundamental  rights,
such as privacy and protection of personal data, needs to be  found  on  the
basis of the principle of  proportionality,  in  the  discretion  of  Member
States (see the  cases  Productores  de  Música  de  España  (Promusicae)  v
Telefónica  de  España  SAU   (C-275/06[101])   and   LSG-Gesellschaft   zur
Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten GmbH v Tele2  Telecommunication  GmbH
(C-557/07[102])).
Moreover privacy or personal data protection rights should not preclude  the
enforcement of  copyrights  against  persons  that  systematically  infringe
copyright

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[9] This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several
occasions.
[10] Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council
of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[11]  Collective Management Organisations play a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[15] For possible  long  term  measures  such  as  the  establishment  of  a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title)  see  section  VII  of
this consultation document.
[16] For instance, the Reflection Document on “Creative Content in a
European Digital Single Market: Challenges for the Future”, 22 October
2009, page 12, second paragraph, lines 5-7, states that: “the present legal
framework does not in itself prevent rightholders from commercialising
their works on a multi-territory basis”.

[21] Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
22 May 2001 on  the  harmonisation  of  certain  aspects  of  copyright  and
related rights in the information society.
[22] Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs.
[23] Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[24] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[25] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction of a transient or  inci=FG^_`a}~€‚ƒ??‘«¬­®¯°±òäÖÊdental  nature
are, under  certain  conditions,  excluded  (see  art.  5(1)   of  Directive
2001/29/EC).
[26] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[27] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[28] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[29] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

[35] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

[39] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[40] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[41] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[50] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.

[62] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.
