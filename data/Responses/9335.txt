ANGA responses on the Commission’s public consultation on the review of the
EU copyright rules
Deadline 5 March 2014
ANGA Verband Deutscher Kabelnetzbetreiber e.V. (Association of German Cable
Operators, referred to herein after as “ANGA”) represents the interests of more than
190 leading companies in the German broadband-cable industry, including Kabel
Deutschland, Unitymedia KabelBW, Tele Columbus, PrimaCom, wilhelm.tel, Pep-
com, Deutsche Telekabel und NetCologne. The cable network operators organized in
ANGA directly or indirectly serve more than 17 million subscribers in Germany. Ap-
proximately 4.8 million households are using their cable connections also for broad-
band internet access and telephony.
ANGA supports the Commission’s approach to conduct a comprehensive review of
the existing copyright law in the EU. Developments in the way copyrighted material is
distributed and used especially in the online environment make it indeed necessary
to determine the topics that need to be adapted to new challenges.
In this respect it is important to notice that the ongoing digitalization does not only
present chances and challenges to right holders but also to right users. The interests
of both parties have to be balanced in order to guarantee cultural diversity, consumer
satisfaction and economic growth in all respective sectors in the European Union.
The cable network operators are the engine driving the media sector; they are the
actors guaranteeing a lively media landscape characterized by pluralism, as is evi-
denced by the consistently growing selection of programs available in their networks.
Both as providers of infrastructure and as platform operators, cable companies are
making an important contribution towards achieving the objectives of pluralism and
media diversity. Today, cable operators do not only offer linear television program.
They also provide their customers with a variety of new services like video on de-
mand and near video on demand, network video recorders, search functions and
programming guides as well as home entertainment boxes that connect the tradition-
al TV set to the internet and its vast offer.
Consequently, the acquisition of rights plays an important role in the daily business of
cable operators. The respective rights vary depending on the service that shall be
offered. Especially with new services the acquisition of the necessary rights has be-
come more difficult because the current licensing practice and the underlying laws do
not fit the purpose anymore. More and more the existing copyright becomes an ob-
stacle to the development and introduction of new services.
Hence, the German cable operators support a review of the copyright rules in the EU
that will make them fit for the digital age.
ANGA therefore answers the Commission’s questionnaire as follows:

      Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from any-
where in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representa-
tives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to contin-
ue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online ser-
vices are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access
such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is available in all
Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access
their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State
they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for

  Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for
musical works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such
as film or record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements be-
tween right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at
the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensur-
ing an adequate level of protection for right holders.

2.   [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking to
     provide online services across borders in the EU?
German cable operators currently have a national business – they operate on a na-
tional basis only. Hence, ANGA is not aware of any problems in connection with the
offer of online services across EU borders. How the businesses of cable operators
might change in the future is open. There is, however, an increased demand from
customer side to access content offered by their cable operator not only on their TV
screen at home but on any device and from any place – even beyond the borders of
their home country. Cable operators have started to offer their customers services
that can be accessed not only on the TV but also PCs or portable computers and
smartphones. Therefore, ANGA follows the developments around multi-territorial li-
censing closely.
The draft directive on the collective management of copyrights introduced rules on
the multi-territorial licensing for online-music rights.
Although German cable operators currently do not need pan-European licenses to
offer their services they support the general possibility for multi-territorial licensing of
rights. Should the European legislator come to deciding that provisions on a multi-
territorial licensing regime shall be implemented on a general basis they need to con-
sider several things:
The clearing of rights must not become any more difficult than it already is, in
fact, it should be simplified. Considering the newly introduced right holders’ “right
to choose” their collecting society (Art. 5(2) of the CRM draft directive) ANGA expects

lishing a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.
                                                6
the clearing process to be obstructed. This situation would probably be worsened by
introducing multi-territorial licenses. ANGA therefore sees the necessity to balance
the expected obstacles for right users by two measures:
(1) collecting societies have to be obliged to reciprocally contract with each
other in order to ensure that right users have to contract with only a limited number
of collecting societies in order to clear the necessary rights (“one stop shop”), and
(2) collecting societies have to be obliged to contract with right users who seek
right clearance in order to ensure that right users can effectively obtain the necessary
licenses.
Nationally operating operators must not be disadvantaged. Currently, only a lim-
ited number of operators actively seek the possibility to offer their services on a pan-
European level. This situation is the result of a long period of development of national
companies in Europe which cannot be changed overnight. In fact, multi-territorial li-
censes might even support the “wrong” players, i.e. big international players who op-
erate “over the top”, which could lead to heavy obstructions of competition. Accord-
ingly, the EU legislator has to ensure that nationally operating European operators
will not suffer from the introduction of multi-territorial licensing. They still need the
possibility to clear the rights only for the national territory they operate in. The legisla-
tor also has to ensure that the administrative effort for national operators in the rights
clearing process remains appropriate.
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across bor-

      a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

7.    Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
      solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
      services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
      holders?
     YES – Please explain
ANGA believes that further measures are necessary to increase the cross-border
availability of content services. For cable operators – even if operating on a national
basis only – this plays an important role as regards the “portability of rights”. From a
customer point of view it is often difficult to understand why they can consume e.g. a
video-on-demand service they ordered from a cable operator in their home country
but not while being on vacation in another country. Cable operators would like to offer
the benefits of taking content “across borders” without having to face a complicated
and long lasting right clearing process.
Hence, ANGA believes that in general the clearing of rights and the acquisition of
licenses should be simplified. Right users need legal certainty in order to offer inno-
vative services and satisfy consumer demand.
As a general simplification of the licensing process would lead to better offers of ser-
vice providers and an improved user experience it would probably also help reduce
illegal distribution and consumption of content.
                                                  8
One of the main issues cable operators have today is the fact that they have to deal
with a number of collecting societies in order to clear the necessary rights for a given
service. To simplify this procedure, the installation of a “one-stop-shop” principle
should be considered. Such a one-stop-shop requires that collecting societies are
obliged to reciprocally contract with each other. Reciprocity agreements ensure that
all collecting societies are empowered to licence any right to a right user. Further-
more, an obligation for collecting societies to contract on competitive terms with eve-
ry right user would have to be introduced on EU level. Such an obligation would
guarantee that no right user is being discriminated.
Another concept that should be considered is the “all-rights-included” (ARI) license.
Such an ARI license should cover the clearance of all exploitation forms in a given
use-case.
Apart from the necessity for a general simplification of the licensing process ANGA
sees the need for a legal framework that better balances the interests of right hold-
ers, right users and in the end consumers. An important step in achieving such bal-
ance is to revise the legal rules for collecting societies further to what the CRM di-
rective suggests.
CRM Directive fails to take account of rights users’ concerns
In Germany, collecting societies are subject to a special regulatory framework as es-
tablished by the Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz (UrhWahrnG, Copyright Admin-
istration Act). This Act includes a mandatory obligation, which may be enforced be-
fore the courts, to take out individual licenses, and to conclude general agreements
with associations of users. Moreover, where a dispute has arisen with a view to ex-
clusive rights (so-called “rights of interdiction” (Verbotsrechte)), users have the option
to obtain the rights on a preliminary basis by depositing the remuneration being de-
manded. The wording of the new CRM directive does not include any equivalent pro-
cedural rules serving to protect the rights users as they do not establish any licensing
obligations.
The stipulations made in the German Copyright Administration Act are justified by the
strong market position that the collecting societies have, which is the result of their
function as an aggregator of a multitude of exclusive rights and claims to remunera-
tion. In fact, collecting societies have a factual monopoly by their nature, as they fre-
quently bundle all or large parts of the rights given in a certain category.
Early on, the German legislator recognized the particular power held by the collecting
societies and has taken action to mitigate it by establishing procedural regulations
serving to protect the users, in particular by obligating the collecting societies to take
out licenses or to conclude agreements also with the users. The lawmakers created
the additional entitlement of user associations to conclude general agreements in
order to put in place a counterweight, in the form of an option to acquire bundled
rights, to the collective rights management by collecting societies.
The rights users’ need for protection has increased in the digital world
The need to establish a special regulatory framework for collecting societies has not
become less urgent as technology has progressed. On the contrary, commercial
rights users have a stronger need than ever for protection in the digital world. The
reason is that since no capacity bottlenecks exist any longer, their customers will ex-
pect a comprehensive selection of content to be available. Generally, commercial

                                            9
rights users will need to have access to the entire repertoire of a rights category in
order to satisfy customer demand, and have no means of passing on individual con-
tent. Accordingly, the collecting societies must be mandatorily obligated to take out
licenses or to conclude general agreements, which obligation is secured for exclusive
rights by the rights users having the option to deposit the remuneration. To the con-
trary, the CRM directive intensifies the mandatory obligation to take out licenses or
conclude general agreements vis-à-vis the right holders, but fails to include such an
obligation vis-à-vis the rights users. Unfortunately, the directive is imbalanced in this
regard.
The above procedural regulations, specifically the mandatory obligation to take out
licenses or conclude general agreements also vis-à-vis associations of users, are of
particular importance to small and medium enterprises who, on their own, do not
have any sufficient market power to respond to the collecting societies. Many of them
have only limited legal expertise available and thus trust in the acquisition of bundled
rights by way of general agreements concluded by the user associations of which
they are members. In the German cable sector, this concerns a large number of local
cable network operators and municipal fiber cable network operators. Where the ac-
quisition of rights becomes too complicated a matter for them, this will also act to the
detriment of right holders – in the end, they stand to lose significant revenue from this
group of users if the enterprises concerned decide to no longer use the rights (and
pay remuneration for them) in light of the unreasonably high transaction costs.
In order to balance out the proposals of the CRM directive to the extent still possible,
ANGA believes it is important that Member States are still allowed to keep in place
their individual supervisory regimes for collecting societies.
General deposit obligation is unreasonable
Under German law (Section 11 paragraph 2 of the Copyright Administration Act), de-
posit of remuneration primarily serves the interest of rights users. Right users have
the opportunity to obtain the necessary rights on a preliminary basis where the
amount of the remuneration demanded cannot be agreed on. This is important as
regards the right holders’ rights of interdiction. A general deposit obligation that would
also apply to mere claims to remuneration does not exist, however. And such an ob-
ligation would constitute an unreasonable hardship for rights users. To date, the tar-
iffs demanded by collecting societies – increasingly, these are entirely normal com-
panies under private law who follow nothing but the rules of business – are not sub-
ject to any preliminary review; all the governmental supervisory office with the Bun-
despatentamt (Federal Patent Office) does is to roughly monitor the situation in order
to detect any abuses. The collecting societies unilaterally determine the charges they
raise, and in many cases will reduce them only after lengthy negotiations or court
proceedings. If a general deposit obligation were to apply in this regard, the risk is
that the rights users would be deprived of excessively high amounts of their liquid
funds for long periods of time, and this, in the end, unlawfully. To cite our sector as
an example, this measure is liable to curb the politically desired provision of broad-
band connections in regions where they are not sufficiently available.
Instead of instituting an obligation to deposit remuneration, EU copyright law should
follow German law by providing for no more than a deposit option that is available to
rights users. In cases of doubt, we would like to see the complex issue of deposit,
which has highly significant impacts in practice, discussed at the national level.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be au-
thorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communica-
tion to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemina-
tion of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmis-
sions and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single

    Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring
rights” in, respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by
copyright is referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is re-
ferred to as “other subject matter”.
12
    The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any
means and in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary
acts of reproduction of a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art.
5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
13
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to
authorise or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive
2001/29/EC).

territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the coun-
tries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.   Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when con-
     tent is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" ap-
proach15)
In order to ensure legal certainty a European legal rule is necessary to clarify the
boarders of the territory in which content is being made available. At this point it is no
possible to give a final answer on which solution would best clarify the existing uncer-
tainties.
ANGA believes that further consultations and impact assessments are necessary in
this regards. Today, it is unclear what the extension of the “country of origin” princi-
ples could have.



9.   [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
     the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
     whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
     transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
     (including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
        – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for
copyright and related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to ju-
risdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney
vs KDG Mediatech).
15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act
that must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regard-
less of in how many Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has
already been introduced at EU level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC
on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to
satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmis-
sions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licens-
ing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
    rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a down-
    load) create problems for you?
  YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
  problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legisla-
  tion to achieve the "bundling of rights")
ANGA believes that a general simplification of the rights clearing process is needed
in cases where a single use case is based on several technological steps.
Example: Some cable operators have started to offer a service called “network PVR”
(virtual video recorder) to their customers. Such a network PVR records the linear TV
signal and stores the content in “the cloud”. This process of recording and replaying
entails several copyright-relevant steps that all need licensing. In Germany up to four
relevant rights might be concerned. But also for more traditional services the clearing
process for cable operators has become more and more complicated as well as time
and money consuming.
In order to be legally certain to have all necessary licenses, a provider would hence
need to clear a number of different rights which might be represented by as many
different right holders or collecting societies. This situation is expected to get even
more complicated once the new “right to choose” their collecting societies for right
users (Article 5(2) CRM directive) enters into force.
This appears inappropriate.
From the perception of the end user, using a network PVR (or a similar service) is
ONE use case. Therefore, it is ANGA’s believe that the clearing of the necessary
rights should be possible in ONE step. Otherwise the difficulties of the licensing pro-
cess might encumber innovation and the introduction of new, customer demanded
services.
In order to solve the problems caused by the increasing fragmentation of rights (and
repertoire) and by collecting societies’ abuse of dominant positions, ANGA supports
any legislation that increases the possibility (no obligation) to offer all rights included
(ARI) packages, facilitates joint licensing and achieves the “bundling of rights”. Es-
sential in this regard is more transparency, more in particular relating to the function-
ing of collecting societies (c.f. answer to question 7). Any new legislation should en-
sure greater transparency of rights management (which rights are held by each col-
lecting society and which rights owners they represent) and of the basis for calculat-
ing the fees charged by collecting societies. In many instances, (collecting societies
set tariffs unilaterally without giving commercial negotiations a chance and the basis
                                               13
for calculation of the rate level is often totally unclear). This is being addressed in the
proposal for a Collective Rights Management Directive but should be improved fur-
ther (c.f. answer to question 7 above).




Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the pub-
lic subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such cop-
ies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provid-
ed for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
    under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
    authorisation of the rightholder?

     NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
     circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
     public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The linking to another website containing copyrighted content should not be rendered
a copyright relevant act as it cannot be seen as a separate act of making available.
Hyperlinks only improve the retrievability of content on the internet and are therefore
generally appreciated.

    work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
    memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
    subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

     NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific

When looked at from the viewpoint of the end user (use case), this scenario has to
be classified as an action that is not copyright relevant.
The mere watching of a video on a screen has not to be licensed. It should hereby
not play a role whether the respective content comes e.g. from a DVD or is streamed
over the internet.
Even if the technical processes behind the watching (caching in the temporary
memory of the user’s computer) might be deemed a reproduction of the content, the
use case as the result of the action in question should determine the legal evaluation.
From the user’s perspective, the mere watching of a stream online has the same
quality as the watching of a DVD and should be evaluated accordingly.


Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the dis-
tribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribu-
tion of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be
applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where
the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions, notably relating
to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a
copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and de-
lete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand mar-
ket of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market
for physical goods).

   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of
a second-hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for
an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program cov-
ered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right
may be subject to exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download with the right hold-
er’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to
the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

    quences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
    digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
ANGA does not support the transfer of the principle of exhaustion to previously pur-
chased digital content. The differences between physical and virtual products as de-
scribed in the questionnaire above not only justify the different treatment of both cat-
egories of products but even make it necessary. Otherwise the existing balance in
the value added chain might be disrupted.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. How-
ever, this prohibition is not absolute21. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be
made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a
longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly
being considered22.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
    licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES




16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]



21
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
22
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Coun-
cil of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online data-
base is currently being set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.
                                                  16
The benefit of an EU registration system would increase transparency and hence
legal security for right users. It could also help to simplify the rights clearance pro-
cess.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
One of the key issues with a EU registration system would be the reliability. In order
to make such a system work, an obligation for the right holders/collecting societies to
report on a recurring basis the rights they hold/represent would be necessary. Fur-
thermore, a control mechanism would be needed to ensure that the data are correct.
That also entails that responsibilities are clear in case data is incorrect and an
agreement is concluded on false basis. In any case, right users must not be obliged
to check the given data. Such proofing obligation for rights users would in fact con-
tradict the purpose of an EU registration system.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]



      Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation ex-
ceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocop-
ying23. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes
(blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as
mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm
they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her com-
puter, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees2425.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
    private copying and reprography exceptions26 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
The term and the area of the private copying regime should be defined more clearly
as there are no common provisions across all member states, even though directive
2001/29/EG envisages the option of private copying. In some member states, such
as Germany for example, it is possible to make a copy for private use to a limited ex-
tent of a work protected by copyright, as an exception to the author’s sole right of re-
production. In return, the author receives a so-called device or blank media levy,
which is charged by the respective collecting society, in Germany the centre for pri-
vate copying rights (Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte – ZPÜ), for devices
with a recording function.
With the emergence of recording devices such as tape recorders, video and cassette
recorders, private individuals could reproduce works. In order to make the control of
homes unnecessary, the German legislator introduced the possibility of private copy-
ing paired with a levy system. Due to technical progress, end users now have more
ways of reproducing works. Some cable operators have started to offer their custom-
ers virtual network PVRs. These virtual network PVRs virtually store the recorded
content “in the cloud”. Then the customer can access the content from anywhere and
on any device. To date, the legal framework has not been adapted to these devel-
opments.
For the end user it makes no difference whether they record a film on their conven-
tional video recorder or in the cloud on a network PVR. For the provider of the film
there is a difference though: due to the underlying technical view in Germany, for ex-
ample, the provider of the film would have to clear a number of rights to legitimize the
use of a network PVR. This would create disproportionate additional effort on the
provider’s side. To ensure innovation and the development of new offers, services
should be considered from a use-case perspective. The same forms of use should be
subject to the same licensing obligation, regardless of the underlying technical pro-
cesses.

     NO – Please explain
Private copies should essentially be possible and without an additional licence fee
where the harm to the right holder is minimal. In fact, the respective content is al-
ready subject to copyright remuneration as part of the licensed cable service.
It has to be ensured, though, that existing business models are not undermined by
private copying. To ensure this, it must be ensured that the private copy is actually
private and remains so.



66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. ser-
    vices based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on differ-
    ent devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the
    one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
The introduction of levies for new online services would probably hinder innovation
and the development of said services. The increased price for the offer would – in the
end – have to be borne by the customers. Higher prices make services less attrac-
tive.
The situation of the right holders on the other hand would not noticeably change:
They are remunerated already through the licenses paid for the cable service.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying lev-
ies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold
(e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemp-

     Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE30 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has con-
sulted broadly on this text31. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the
current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dis-
semination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the
current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in
particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested that en-
forcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright,
measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is
used for a commercial purpose32. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of interme-
diaries in the IP infrastructure33. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safe-
guards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

76. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for in-
    fringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
        – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
ANGA believes that the current system of copyright enforcement is sufficient to pro-
tect right holders. It does, on the other hand, not appropriately balance the interests
of all groups involved in the enforcement processes. The following issues should be
considered when evaluating the enforcement regime:
No notification mechanisms – No blocking of websites – No interference with
customers internet access
German cable network operators were in the past confronted with requests to imple-
ment notification mechanisms. Due to legal and technical constraints cable operators
have not acted on such requests to date.
As there are several open legal issues and difficulties in this context, ANGA would
consider it premature and disproportionate at this time to
-       legally oblige ISPs to send out warning notices without prior judicial control,
-      legally oblige ISPs to block websites or online services containing content of
any kind,
-      legally oblige ISPs to suspend the internet connection of a customer who al-
legedly infringed copyright.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established

                                                   21
Notification mechanisms by intermediaries are not proportionate
ANGA believes that notification mechanisms to inform an alleged copyright infringer
about the allegedly infringing character of his activity can be a reasonable solution as
regards the enforcement of copyrights.
In Germany, the possibility to send “warnings” to alleged infringers already exists.
Right holders can file for an injunction to obtain the name and address of the sub-
scriber whose access has been used to commit the allegedly infringing action. The
corresponding rule in Article 8 of the IP-Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) is im-
plemented in Sec. 101 of the German Copyright Act. It is important to note that a
court order is a necessary requirement for an ISP to hand over subscriber data.
The retrieval of customer data (name, address) based upon an IP-address and a
time stamp requires the ISP to store and process personal data. Personal data in
communication processes is protected by the fundamental right of secrecy of tele-
communication (Sec. 10 of the German Constitution, see also sec. 88 of the German
Telecommunications Act). The restriction of this right requires an act of parliament.
Such an act of parliament was established in sec. 101 of the German Copyright Act.
When talking about online “piracy” often minors and even young children are the
ones committing the copyright violation, mostly without being aware of the possible
consequences. This should be taken into consideration when pushing for copyright
enforcement. The same applies in cases of first offenders: It appears to be propor-
tionate to warn an alleged infringer before taking legal action against him.
ANGA believes that the mechanism of ex ante judicial control is absolutely necessary
to protect subscribers’ rights and prevent unjustified bulk retrievals by right holders.
Accordingly, ANGA would consider problematic any approaches aiming at obliging
ISPs to act upon mere request of a right holder without proper judicial ex ante con-
trol. “Warning notes” or notices sent out by ISPs that are not based upon a court or-
der would negatively impact a subscriber’s right to communicate. They would most
likely also severely damage the customer relationship that the ISP built based on
trust and confidentiality. This is especially true in cases of wrongful warnings in which
it would be unclear how the subscriber could legally defend himself.
The issues at hand are
-     Data protection and privacy as regards the retaining and processing of the
necessary data
-     Legal protection against wrongful warnings
-     Unreasonable impositions for ISPs
-     Unjustifiable damage to customer relationships.
The constitutional issues of “warning notes” models obliging ISPs to act without ex
ante judicial control have been discussed in Germany for many years now. As a re-
sult of this intense debate, a legal obligation for ISPs to send out warning notes to
subscribers was rejected, predominantly for privacy reasons. This development
should be considered in the context of a similar discussion on the European level.
Instead of trying to enforce copyright through questionable measures of notices and
law suits against individuals it seems to be more constructive to strengthen the co-
operation of law enforcement authorities: The system of notices only works if the right

                                           22
holder can determine an IP-address which can then be used to identify the subscrib-
er (not necessarily the infringer!). However, illegal streaming services that are re-
sponsible for a much greater number of copyright infringements than P2P cannot be
fought with this system. Therefore, it is essential that law enforcement agencies –
national, pan-European and international – co-operate better in order to arrest the
operators of the illegal streaming platforms.
Data requests of right holders – Need for reimbursement for ISPs
The current system of processing information requests needs to be improved: De-
termining and providing requested customer data is a costly process. Yet, there is
currently no legal provision under which right holders must reimburse ISPs for their
efforts. As the determination and provision of such data is in the interest of the right
holder, he should bear all incidental costs.
Therefore, ANGA asks the Commission to introduce rules on reimbursement where
injunctions against an intermediary are sought. It should be legally determined that
-      all costs of defending and implementing the injunction including the right hold-
er’s own costs must be borne by the right holder even when its claim is successful
-      all costs arising from fulfilling a rights holder’s request regarding the provision
of customer data, including additional infrastructure and labour costs must be borne
by the right holder.
No interference with customers’ internet access
ANGA agrees that commercial scale infringements of copyright should be prosecut-
ed. However, the suspension of the subscriber’s account, as discussed in several
countries in the past, would in most cases be unjustified and disproportional. There-
fore, ANGA does not support systems resembling the “3-strikes-modell” that was es-
tablished in France some time ago.
The following issues have not been solved to date and would question the legality of
suspending accounts:
-      Neither the right holder nor the ISP can be completely certain if the sub-scriber
is identical with the alleged infringer. One account can be used by several people
and the question of liability has not been answered positively in many cases. Hence,
the suspension of an account might in fact impact the wrong person.
-     The wrongful termination of a customer’s internet access would severely dam-
age the ISP’s relationship with its customer.
-       An internet connection has become so important over the last years that a
termination might even be unconstitutional. Internet access is necessary not only to
participate in social and cultural activities but for many people also for professional
purposes.
-       To determine if an account should be suspended, in fact if “enough” allegedly
infringing actions have been committed through it, the ISP – or another institution –
would have to store the relevant data. This would include personal data and in some
cases even sensitive data. At the moment, there is no legal basis for such data stor-
age in Germany.
-    The negative evaluation by French authorities should be taken into account
when considering suspension of access accounts: The first report on Hadopi did not

                                           23
prove the effectiveness of the system. In particular as only P2P-platforms and not
streaming offers can be addressed with the “3-strikes” model, the appropriateness of
such a system has to be questioned.



77. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient in-
    volvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
    payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
    infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
    foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
