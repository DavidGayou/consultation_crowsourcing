                                                                             1
     I.    Introduction


Online distribution is a great opportunity for commercial broadcasters and our sector has
long understood the imperative to diversify our business models. Without exception,
European media groups are enthusiastically launching new services, seeking out new
revenue streams and enhancing the existing offer to consumers. We highlighted a number
of these initiatives in a brochure published in 2011, “Content and Consumers”’, and our
members’ online offers have continued to dramatically increase ever since. Consumers
today can enjoy films and television in more ways, on more devices and at better quality
than ever before. There are now over 3000 on-demand audiovisual services available in
Europe1, compared to fewer than 700 at the end of 2008. All this growth has been realised in
parallel to the continued strength of linear, scheduled television services.
Far from presenting barriers to these new innovative services, the robust but flexible
European copyright acquis underpins all these services, whether offline or online, broadcast,
catch-up, streamed or on-demand. As such, respect for copyright is the foundation stone not
just of the European television industry, an €84.4bn sector in our own right, but also of the
wider creative content industry. According to a recent OHIM Observatory Study2 copyright
intensive industries account for 4.2% of EU GDP and 3.2% of EU jobs.
Without a strong copyright law, commercial operators would have no incentive to reinvest in
the next season of creative, journalistic and sporting content. Indeed, according to a
previous study3 carried out for the European Commission, 44% of total European
broadcasting revenues were reinvested into content. For the main commercial broadcasting
groups this investment amounts to over €15 billion a year or €41 million a day.


So, why question such a well-functioning system?


We have three concerns about process: evidence, timing and the need for proportionate
stakeholder representation.
First, an evidence base for questioning the system has not been established. In fact the
opposite is true. The ACT and its members invested considerable resources in playing an
active part in the Licenses for Europe (L4E) initiative. The various parts of the commercial
audiovisual value chains made 14 presentations to WG1, three to WG2 and five to WG3. This
represents a considerable body of evidence – all publicly available on the Commission
website - in support of our contention that industry is responding to the demand and the
needs of users and consumers and is delivering content on digital platforms. The opposing
case for radical copyright reform was barely made in L4E, and when it is voiced tends to be
underpinned by generalisations and anecdotes rather than factual evidence.

We fail to see why the Commission intends to set out its intentions on such an important
policy field for our sector as soon as summer 2014, apparently in the face of the weight of
evidence from the L4E process and other studies4. In addition, the ACT understands that the
Commission has asked economists Charles River Associates to undertake a thorough
economic analysis on territorial licensing and the internal market which has yet to be
completed or published, yet it appears to have already decided its position on the need for
reform in this area without waiting to take account of its findings. We suggest that the
Commission should not take a position on the need to reform in this area before proper
studies have been duly considered. There is also a risk that the process may turn into a
“numbers game”, with anti-copyright groups and certain politicians manipulating the
process by supplying pre-prepared anti copyright answers to the consultation and urging
large numbers of individuals to send these in. We sincerely hope that the Commission will
not be unduly swayed by such orchestrated mass responses and instead insist that due
weight is given to the origin and substance of evidence.
Finally, it is important that this consultation is not seen in isolation. Full-scale copyright
reform is far from the only way in which any imbalances in the system can be redressed.
Examples of more targeted approaches include current copyright reviews taking place in
some Member States, the EU directive on Orphan Works and the directive on Collective
Rights Management. Proper implementation of the transparency requirements in this latter
directive, together with scrutiny from national competition authorities, should assist the
cross-border flow of content and lead to a gradual clarification as to the pricing between
some Collective Management organisations.

       II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
     NO


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
     NO
Cross border access can be delivered by the market under the current copyright framework.
There are no legal obstacles to the trade in AV productions on a multi-territory basis. If a
broadcaster wished to acquire rights for any number of European markets, it would be a
commercial negotiation between that company and the appropriate rightsholder.
Commercial broadcasters assess the viability of cross-border AV distribution based on
various considerations, which include consumer demand, commercial appetite, language,
cultural differences, ability to provide customer support in more than one language, local
consumer protection requirements and the significant cost of marketing a service in foreign
territories. Delivering content to the consumer has a price. Besides technical distribution
costs (including CDN), there are costs involved linked to, for example, costumer support in
different languages, the application of different consumer protection rules and local
marketing. In the absence of monetisable demand, delivering content outside of the home
market will involve a non-recoupable cost.
Example: A free service will typically refinance itself via advertising, which is tailored at
specific markets or products or aligned with the advertising campaign in other media of that
respective country by that respective advertiser. Therefore, for example, an Austrian user
might not be able to access the German website but would be redirected to the
(identical/mirrored) Austrian website.
Further regulatory intervention is not needed in this area. The ACT and other audiovisual
industry stakeholders made the following key points in the EC’s Licences for Europe process:
      •      Broadcasters are one part of a complex series of value chains, each stage of which
             has its own business rationale and investment decisions to underpin strategies on
             distribution;
      •      In today’s multi-platform, multi-window world, territorial distribution is frequently
             the optimum way, via exclusivity and price differentiation, of maximising revenues.
             Crucially, this revenue then flows back into new investment in content. Around 44%
             of the €86bn broadcaster turnover in Europe is reinvested in new content production
             annually5;

    •   Not only do national language, tastes and interests vary, but programme genres are
        key factors in determining value across markets. Sport – which viewers wish to watch
        live – raises different issues from a drama series or classic movie. Even within genres,
        different commercial factors will inform the distribution strategies of popular
        regional sports (ice-hockey, rugby, etc) from those with global appeal. Distribution
        strategy will often be decided on a programme-by-programme basis. Initiatives such
        as ‘download and play’ or one-day subscription packages for sports channels are
        being trialled;
    •   Consumer demand is uneven. The Plum study6 commissioned by for DG MARKT is
        good evidence of this point. Plum estimates the total demand for transfrontier
        audiovisual services at €760m annually (0.7% of the EU television market). But
        demand is uneven across the 702 markets analysed. In over 200 such markets, the
        value is below €10,000 p.a. In others, where the demand for such services is higher –
        e.g., Romanian language services in Spain or Italy are valued at over €40m p.a. -
        commercial broadcasters often already provide services for many such expatriate
        groups; Indeed, wherever monetisable demand exists, that demand is being
        addressed – and this is happening without the need for legislative intervention;
    •   An EU AV market without territorial exclusivity would also have an adverse impact on
        non-economic goals of media regulation such as cultural and linguistic diversity.
    •   Exclusive territorial distribution indeed works for everyone in the value chain, from
        producer to consumer – and ensures sustainable investment in content:
                Consumers – have access to content in their language that fits their interests,
                at a price they can afford.
                Content Producer/Rights holders – gives them the option to generate
                maximum return on their investment by segmenting rights between one or a
                series of broadcasters or choosing to retain rights to exploit themselves.
                Distributors – majority of platform operators focus on one country or territory
                because it allows them to develop and exploit specialist market knowledge
                and deliver brands, infrastructure, marketing, customer support that best
                serves national/regional consumers.
                Broadcasters – allows them to tailor channels to the audience – local
                language, content that most appeals to the market, locally commissioned
                content, targeted advertising – through a local distributor who has the market
                knowledge and expertise to deliver their channels to the audience.
                Advertisers – advertising is the biggest single revenue stream for European
                television and is highly national (as products are different). Channels that are
                not targeted at national markets are of relatively little value to some
                advertisers.

5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
    YES
See our response to Question 2.


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
    YES
See our response to Question 2.


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
    NO
See our response to Question 2.


8.    Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
    YES
ACT members do not encounter problems regarding the interpretation of the scope of the
“making available” right in practice. From our point of view, any potential issue can be dealt
with through commercial licensing negotiations. If any interpretation issues would arise,
national courts and the European Court of Justice are best placed to handle these.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief7)?
    YES

7
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 6
10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
  NO
Both rights are centralised with the audiovisual producer. Facilitated by national systems of
presumptions of transfer, audiovisual rights are centrally retained by the producer, which
makes licensing of audiovisual works easy and straightforward.
There is evidence that the market may be moving in this direction for music as well, i.e.,
where the mechanical rights are directly related to the ability to exploit the making available
rights, then they should be licensed together with the performance rights, as they are, in this
context, inseparable.


11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
  YES
The question whether the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work triggers the making
available right, remains subject to a case-by-case assessment, and may depend on whether
or not a new audience is reached, as recently confirmed by the ECJ in its Judgment in Case C-
466/12 (Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB) of 13 February 2014. .


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
Exhaustion is a limitation to copyright that was created to allow the first buyer of a physical
good to resell that copy of the item without interference of the rights holder. The idea of
exhaustion of rights was conceived when it seemed obvious that a new copy would have
certain advantages over a resold copy in the market, in terms of absence of physical wear
and tear. In the digital world, where the resold item is identical to the original, exhaustion
would be unfair and harm the business model of the copyright owner. One purchased digital
copy could potentially be resold millions of times on the secondary market, which would - as
a direct effect - destroy the first market. Applying the rule of exhaustion to digital copies
would indeed have the exact same effect as legalising file sharing and would create a strong
disincentive for content service providers to invest in “download to own” platforms, as it
would reduce their ability to monetise rights in subsequent windows.
Also, the digital nature of the service or good makes it difficult to identify a particular ‘item’
and assess whether it has been resold and is no longer in the possession of the first acquirer.
 The rule of “exhaustion” should therefore only remain applicable to the distribution of
tangible properties on material support (a book, a CD, a DVD,…), as confirmed by ECJ
jurisprudence. A general rule of non-exhaustion for the making available right has therefore

                                                                                                7
correctly been codified in Article 3(3) of the Information Society Directive. We see no reason
to reconsider this well-balanced legislation.
As correctly stated in the questionnaire, the decision in the UsedSoft case law was based on
the Computer Programs Directive and can therefore not be applied to subject matter that
falls within the scope of the Information Society Directive. Unlike the Computer Programs
Directive, the Information Society Directive states that the making available right is not
subject to exhaustion, as stated above.


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
and licensing of works and other subject matter?
    NO


16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
We don’t see the possible advantages. The centralisation of the rights in the hands of the
audiovisual producer makes information on the protected rights a very straightforward
exercise. Opening and closing credits are also generally used to identify the rightholders
involved.
On the other hand, we are not opposed to voluntary industry initiatives that seek to create
tools for rights identification for specific genres or categories of works. Many such initiatives
have emerged over the last past years where the market has identified a need to do so.
Some of our members are involved in such initiatives, such as the Linked Content Coalition
and the Global Repertoire Database project . The involvement of the Commission as
convenor is welcome, on condition that there is no move towards standardisation of any of
these database projects on a compulsory basis – this role should be an enabling one, with
any projects remaining market-led.


17.      What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
If this question relates to a mandatory system of registration, we envisage multiple
disadvantages such as:
•        Administrative burden and costs involved for rightholders;
•        The database would never be complete as non-EU originated works couldn’t be
         subject to a registration requirement. This would create confusion as to whether or
         not a certain work is protected.
•        It would be impossible to keep such a database completely up-to-date given the
         great volume of works protected by copyright that are created every day.




                                                                                               8
19.   What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
Many of our members use identifiers and have experienced an increase in the efficiency and
accuracy of music reporting to collecting societies and contributors.
The Global Repertoire Database project is an interesting case study of public-private
collaboration.
However, it should be recognised that such mechanisms do not constitute licensing vehicles.
There should be no move toward standardisation of rights ownership and permissions
databases on a compulsory basis. Licensing of professionally-produced audiovisual content
should be left to individual commercial negotiations.


20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES
There is no compelling evidence to suggest that the current terms of copyright protection
are ill suited to the digital environment.




   III.   Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


   NO
Cultural and political differences between Member States make it unnecessary and
undesirable to agree on a list of mandatory exceptions. The current EU copyright framework
provides Member States with the flexibility they require in order to be able to foster
technological innovation and allow the market to adapt to the fast pace of technological
change.
It is nevertheless important to ensure that exceptions and limitations are correctly
implemented at Member State level.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


  NO
The provisions under art. 5 of the 2001 Information Society Directive are shaped in a flexible
way so that courts, and ultimately the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), are

                                                                                            9
placed in a position to adapt them to the evaluation of new unauthorised uses of
copyrighted works, taking also the “three-step test” in due consideration. There is no need
to interfere in the flexibility that the current EU copyright framework provides to Member
States


23.     Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Exceptions are intended to address situations of market failure. Absent any evidence of
market failure there is no need to add any new limitations and exceptions.
See also answers to questions 21 and 22.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  NO
See answers to questions 21 and 22.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.
See answers to questions 21, 22 and 63.


26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
See answers to questions 21 and 22.


E – lending


39.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
If a new exception were to be introduced to enable libraries to make digital copies available
to the general public, this would disincentivise rights holders audiovisual content service
providers from commercialising such works as the library’s digital copy would compete
unfairly with any licensed service offering the same content.

                                                                                            10
Disabilities


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
The EU regulatory framework is well equipped with measures that support Member States in
their national initiatives related to accessibility services in full respect of the proportionality
and subsidiarity principles. From a copyright perspective, the 2001 Copyright Directive
provides already for exceptions for disabled and we believe this is a balanced approach.
Accessibility requirements applicable to broadcasters are provided for under statutory laws
in a number of Member states. Moreover, concrete legislative steps to encourage
audiovisual media service providers to ensure that their services are gradually made
accessible to people with a visual or hearing disability were adopted under the Audiovisual
Media Services Directive, in December 2007. The rules under the Audiovisual Media Services
Directive aim to make audiovisual content increasingly accessible for persons with
disabilities. Indeed, under this Directive, Member States shall encourage media service
providers under their jurisdiction to ensure that their services are gradually made accessible
to people with a visual or hearing disability , for example through the use of sign language,
subtitling, audio-description and easily understandable menu navigation. These
requirements apply to public and commercial audio-visual media service providers alike.
ACT members have adopted many measures to improve the accessibility of their digital TV
services and equipment to customers with differing levels of disability, whether in
compliance with statutory requirements for the provision of sign language, audio
description/narrative and subtitling and/or voluntarily in line with their corporate and social
responsibility policies.
ACT members believe that industry-led initiatives are the best means to deliver accessible
solutions to consumers with differing abilities, in the absence of significant market failure(s).


User-generated content


63.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
There are several considerations of a general nature to take into account that all lead to the
conclusion that no exception for user-created content should be introduced into the
Directive. Exceptions are intended for situations of market failure and we are not aware of
any market failure in the case of UGC– quite the opposite. Many rightholders license their
content effectively to UGC platforms, which is probably why users were unable to identify
why the current copyright system would be a barrier in this regard during the L4E dialogue.
In addition, and as recently demonstrated in the L4E dialogue, there is no common view on
what UGC actually is.
Even more importantly, an exception for UGC would be in contradiction with the three-step
approach present in the Berne Convention, the TRIPS Agreement and enshrined in the 2001
Directive as well.


                                                                                                11
The introduction of an exception along the lines of the “fair use” defence for transformative
uses in the US would not be effective in the EU. As the fair use principle is based on US
jurisprudence which has been subsequently codified in the Copyright Act, it would be
difficult to import as such in the EU legal framework. It is also worth mentioning that the US
system has not proven to be perfect and does not offer the necessary clarity for rights users
on the one hand and an appropriate level of protection of the rights holders on the other
hand.
In this regard, the Commission should also reflect on who would actually benefit from a UGC
or fair use exception? Large ICT players might take advantage of the uncertainties and
unpredictability that a new exception would trigger. In a system where the boundaries of
exceptions would be based on the outcome of complex and time-consuming proceedings,
individual authors and/or content owners having little or no financial means at their disposal
might feel reluctant to undertake potentially expensive litigation.
The ACT members consider that the current copyright framework in Europe is well equipped
to foster consumers’ creativity. On the one hand, rightholders license their content to UGC
platforms and offer licenses for small scale use. On the other hand, there is a well-
established regime of exceptions that provide the necessary flexibility such as the “free use”
in Germany or the “parody, pastiche and caricature” in France.




      IV.      Private copying and reprography


64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions8 in the digital environment?


     NO
Our sectors' priority is to offer content through licensing. When licensing is impossible in
practice, levies remain a tool in most European countries to compensate right holders for
the copies made of their content. However, this matter should be dealt with at national
level, as a particular approach in one Member State may not be appropriate in another.

72.     [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?


Introduction
It is a matter of common ground between broadcasters, producers, and policymakers that
appropriate remuneration for creators should be ensured.
The model adopted by the majority of EU operators is one where all remuneration rights
(for both primary and secondary uses, including online uses) are included in the lump sum
payment(s) made to authors and/or performers, directly or through authorised bodies. A
few Member States, such as Spain, provide for separate equitable remuneration for
audiovisual performers alongside the exclusive making available right.
We have seen no evidence that the model of lump sum payments fails to deliver adequate
remuneration to rightsholders and believe that the introduction of an unwaivable right to
remuneration for online distribution, especially if it is subject to mandatory collective
management would harm producers, creators and consumers alike.


A mandatory collectively managed right to remuneration is not in the interest of the
creator
As opposed to a remuneration right, the exclusive right gives authors and performers the
right to authorise and prohibit the use of their rights and therefore to freely negotiate the
conditions linked to the authorised use. The mere right to remuneration is a restriction to
the exclusive right: it gives a fixed right to money, but takes away the author’s/performer’s
right to ensure the best possible remuneration.
A collectively managed right to remuneration is a form of “expropriation” that raises
substantial issues at national level, not least from a constitutional point of view. In addition,
it wouldn’t necessarily serve the author’s/performer’s interest, as they would lose the
opportunity to negotiate in their best interest.
Many creators are therefore opposed to compulsory collective management of their rights,
as expressed by the Federation of European Screenwriters (FSE) in their response to the
Audiovisual Green Paper9:
“The application of a statutory right to compensation collectively managed is an inadequate
solution in our opinion. It effectively removes our right to make available and will therefore
produce minimal compensation.”
If a remuneration right would be introduced alongside the exclusive right this would result in
double payments for the same use or be recouped at the basis.

The benefits of buy-out contracts for producers, creators and consumers
For the creator:
The business of audiovisual production and distribution is a business of risk-taking. A
producer has to raise funds, organise locations, insurance, hire authors, actors and many
others and obtain necessary clearances, rights and licenses, without knowing if the
production will be successful. Some productions make money, while others lose money or
break even. Producers are often limited liability companies with a large portfolio of rights on
which to spread the risk and or therefore likely to be risk-prone.
In contrast, most authors/performers may be risk-averse, and may prefer a secure upfront
payment that provides them with a salary to live from, without having to worry about the
potential impact of a flop on their income. And, as confirmed by the OHIM Observatory
Study on Economic contribution of IP-intensive industries10, our sector pays a large premium
above the European average salaries. Therefore, many creators may prefer to receive a
lump sum in exchange of their rights transferred to the producer. By transferring the rights
to the producer, they also transfer the entire risk of the exploitation: they may not have a
proportional share in the potential success, but crucially neither do they share in the
potential losses. A secure income, upfront of the potential exploitation, may be preferable,
not least in times of economic crisis.
A compulsory “per use” payment model would necessarily be recouped by reducing initial
payments as it imposes a sharing of the (positive and negative) risk related to the uncertain
gains/losses between creator and producer, while a lump sum transfers all the risks on the
producer. In case of an unsuccessful online exploitation the creator would therefore lose
income in this scenario.
Finally, creators have an interest in the development of the online market. An unwaivable
right to remuneration could have the negative impact of reducing the amount of new
production, the production of which generates the vast majority of creators’ income.
The best guarantee for fair remuneration is the competitive pressure resulting from a
healthy and competitive market.
For the producer/broadcaster/platform:
Audiovisual producers are in the best competitive position in order to cover costs, to secure
return on investment and make profits in order to create new works. Discovering new
talents, financing the productions of innovative content and helping new creative works to
reach the consumers is an expensive and risky business, that requires the involvement of
those who can take such financial risks and which must, therefore, be rewarded for doing so.
Traditionally, the incidence of collective management/licensing in the audiovisual (AV) sector
is very limited since exploitation rights are centralised in the producer who relies on the
consolidation of rights to finance, produce and distribute AV works. This model is a “one-
stop shop” mechanism, that is key to the functioning of the audiovisual sector, and should
be maintained. This system has preserved the audiovisual sector from the fragmentation
that exists in other sectors.

The fact that it is only the producer who is able to authorise commercial exploitation of
content, whether national or transfrontier, makes for a very efficient system in which
commercial users – including other broadcasters – are certain that they can acquire all
necessary rights from a single point of contact. This system, we believe, works equally well in
the online environment as the offline one and simplifies licensing procedures extremely well.
A limitation to the producer’s freedom to buy out contributors would seem to go against the
Commission’s aim in producing a more simplified and streamlined copyright system that
should encourage more content to be available online. Such a proposal would appear rather
to be introducing new barriers.
In many cases, when the creator is already remunerated in a buy-out contract, such a
remuneration right would also lead to double-payments. In Spain, where a system of an
additional remuneration right exists, the system has been detrimental to the audiovisual
industry.
For the consumer:
The uptake of online distribution services would be handicapped by an additional layer of
remuneration and administration, at the end of the day harming the interests of consumers.
Another issue is the fact that many operators don’t split out a separate fee for online
distribution of content, with the online service typically bundled in with a number of other
free and pay services, some of which are purely communications services with no
audiovisual content element (triple play). To give a very specific example: the majority of
catch-up TV services to date are not offered against specific remuneration, but rather are
offered as additional services to viewers. A compulsory “per use” payment model would
therefore discourage the availability of such services.
In any event, the final user (distributor/platform), that would be obliged to pay the
remuneration right, would be willing to pay less to the producer, which takes money out of
the virtuous cycle of investment in new content. The platforms could also choose to pass on
the additional cost of the remuneration right to the consumer which would result in more
expensive content.


Conclusion
The introduction of a mandatory collectively managed right to remuneration would create a
complex new layer of collective management, which would harm the uptake of new services
and would be detrimental to the interests of producers, creators and consumers alike.
The best way to ensure that the authors and the performers obtain appropriate
remuneration would be to promote the right conditions to stimulate investment in content,
including for distribution on the internet. In this respect, stability and certainty in the
copyright framework is of key importance.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  NO

     VI.   Respect for rights


Introduction

When the Enforcement Directive was first proposed in 2003, the need for a robust anti-
piracy protection was already a vital priority for our sector, but the majority of piracy cases
involving broadcasters concerned hacking of set-top boxes or pirated smart cards for pay TV
services, and therefore were dealt with by the Conditional Access directive. Such cases
remain very important for broadcasters. But as technology has developed, so have the
methods used to commit digital theft and piracy will continue to mutate and grow.

Live television today is the fastest-growing segment of copyright infringement11.

New technologies used by broadcasters enrich the market with new content offerings. But
they also carry risks for the world’s broadcasters, producers and creators by making it easier
to profit from the use of broadcast signals without their consent. Signal misappropriation
through illegal means jeopardises broadcasters’ ability to protect and invest in the
acquisition and creation of content, as well as our role in organising, scheduling, promoting,
and distributing content. This, in turn, adversely affects jobs in our sector and our ability to
serve their audiences with news, information and entertainment.

Broadcasting is also a key driver of social cohesion and cultural development - vital in an
increasingly fragmented world. The technical signal embodying all that activity must be
protected, on any platform.

This is why broadcasters call for a toolkit of anti-piracy measures, rather than a single
solution, including one tackling illegal offers from non-EU countries. Infringements of
intellectual property rights taking place outside the EU indeed constitutes a major source of
concern. The European Commission’s efforts to address this problem through bilateral and
international trade initiatives, notably at the World Intellectual Property Organisation, are to
be supported strongly. We would urge the Commission and Member States to continue to
work at the global level for such an improved level of protection in order to grant a safer
environment to those stakeholders who ensure the financing of professional quality content
which lies at the heart of a thriving convergent media environment. In particular, the private
copying exception should not be used to justify the online communication to the public of
broadcasters’ signals, for commercial gain or otherwise, without the owners’ permission.

The ACT has already drawn attention in another context to the central importance of signal
integrity in converged media markets. In our response to the Commission Green Paper on
Preparing for a Fully Converged Audiovisual World, we called on the Commission as a
priority to

“guarantee the signal integrity of broadcasters as a quid pro quo for editorial responsibility
(this responsibility cannot be guaranteed if third parties interfere with the broadcast
signal)…It is essential for the future of the EU audiovisual market to ensure the integrity of
high value, highly-regulated content. Commercial overlays and other novel techniques should
therefore not be possible without the prior consent of the owner of the content in question".

In day-to-day commercial negotiations, by contrast, much of the detail (contractual
arrangements, platform regulation, existence or otherwise of copyright levies, identification
of beneficiaries) differs from one market to another and should in the first instance be dealt
with at national level.


75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
  YES
For ACT members it is vital that the courts and national enforcement agencies focus on
unambiguous cases of piracy -a movie uploaded via a torrents site, a football match
streamed illegally on Chinese TV station website -which are of course those which cause
commercial damage on a scale which undermines broadcasters’ ability to invest in content.
It is less the question whether copyright infringements have economical scale since any
infringement causes commercial damage and more the question whether it is possible to
eliminate or at least reduce significantly the illegal content offers in the digital environment.
Effective and efficient systems that control and remove infringing content from illegal
websites are essential here.
The political message should be clear: both rightsholders and intermediaries have a role to
play in tackling the theft of content online. At national level, many of our member
companies are engaged in negotiations as to the concrete form this can take (for example a
voluntary code or MoU). This includes dialogues between advertising agencies and right
holders to prevent advertising brokers from funding illegal websites. Cooperation with
different intermediaries (advertising brokers, payment intermediaries, search engines…)
enables one to “follow the money” and focus on mass illegal file-sharing sites or torrent
sites, thereby avoiding targeting of end users.
This form of constructive negotiation among intermediaries and the content industry has not
yet in every Member State led to more cooperation for the fight against piracy. But the form
of constructive negotiation is something which should be encouraged and should be
facilitated by the European Commission.




                                                                                              17
76.     In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
ACT members think that Article 8(3) of the Directive is an important tool in achieving
cooperation from intermediaries, in so far as it is correctly implemented in the member
states.
Combined with voluntary cooperation (as discussed under Question 75), most member
states have developed a toolkit of potential measures that can be taken and that is adapted
to the needs of a particular Member State. We believe that this is the right approach.
On the other hand, considering the contradictory nature of the decisions taken by national
courts, the Commission should clarify whether or not certain internet intermediaries which
offer services consisting of hosting should avail themselves of the limitations on liability
provided for under the e-commerce directive, for those information society (content)
services which such intermediaries also provide to end users (in a number of cases without
prior authorisation from the relevant rights owners) and organise in a catalogue. In our view,
such clarification could increase legal certainty and could potentially lead to an increase in
the number of legal (online content) services available to end users.


77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
   YES


     VII. A single EU Copyright Title


78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
Cultural and political differences between Member States make it unnecessary and
undesirable to replace national laws by a single EU Copyright Title.
Even if the Commission were convinced of the case for reform, and notwithstanding the
enormous legislative effort required to consolidate all the acquis into one text, and the lack
of clarity surrounding the legal basis which would need to underpin such a measure, we do

                                                                                           18
not believe that it would bring about the desired effect. It is also unclear if a unified title
would still allow for licensing per territory, which is a practice that underpins the viability of
audiovisual productions.




 VIII.    Other issues

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.


It is important that the Commission looks at potential copyright reform from a holistic view,
taking into account the economic health of the whole ecosystem.
