      Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules

                 Contribution of Fédération Française des Télécoms

FFTelecoms welcomes the current public consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules and
thanks the EU Commission for this opportunity to provide views.

FFTelecoms’ opinion is that the digital distribution of cultural goods as well as the European single
market challenge the regulatory regimes implemented in the Member States and hence call for more
convergence of the various regulatory frameworks.

FFTelecoms support copyright, as a fundamental tool to foster innovation and creation, and the need
for an appropriate protection mechanism of rights owners. At the same time, FFTelecoms’ members
are at the forefront of the digital revolution, investing over 7 billion euros each year that directly
benefit the European economy by helping their customers, citizens and businesses alike, harvest the
social and economic value of the internet.

Moreover, French telecom operators contribute massively to the economy of the creative industries,
representing 27% of their funding excluding TV license fee, as the following figures show:
    - French operators’ contribution to the private copy levies amounts to circa €90 million,
       roughly 50% of the total amount collected1
    - The tax on operators to fund the audiovisual public service amounts to €235 million per year2
    - The tax for the French cinema fund on telecom operators amounts to €190 million per year3

According to CNC (Centre National du Cinema) data, the amount received from distributors, including
telecom operators, to fund the Cosip4 will surpass the one received from TV channel in 2014 (€270
million vs €267 million)5.

However, the current fragmentation of national frameworks as regards copyright and exceptions
bears significant damages for both copyright owners and European ICT firms, as it hinders
innovation. In the digital economy, innovation is at the core of value creation for all stakeholders (the
public, right holders and technical intermediaries) and mechanisms inherited from the analogue era,
such as the private copy levies system, should not impede this need to create value through
innovation.

As the exception for private copying- born some 30 years ago- has become a deterrent to innovation
in the digital era, reexamining the framework related to private copying is desirable.

Taking into account, among others, the principle of technological neutrality, distributors should
rightfully be entitled to offer innovative services matching consumer demand. These services should
enable the public to fully benefit from the copyright exceptions in counterpart of a fair, transparent
amount paid to right owners. For example, the recording of videos should be made possible to that
respect.

To deliver the most value for the European economy as a whole while reinforcing European creative
industries, the Commission’s review of the copyright framework should aim at setting the standard
for fair balance, both among competitors and in the relationships between stakeholders.

Fair competition on the market has always been a major objective of the Commission.
By addressing the discrepancies among Member States’ frameworks the Commission would help
close the gap that benefit those market players taking advantage of them. Differences in the
regulatory framework of copyright levies and in the implementation of compensation mechanism
help fuel the “grey market”. For instance, storage devices such as memory cards may be subject to a




                                                                                                       2
fee in some Member States but not in others6. Private copy levies are much higher in countries such
as France or Germany than in any other. Harmonization is needed to let all market players to
compete fairly and eliminate the grey market that endangers European businesses.

Reaching a fair balance between the various stakeholders’ interests in the evaluation process of the
prejudice to right owners as regards private copy levies is necessary. There must be a balance
between fair compensation of the right holders, consumers’ interests and the capacity of businesses
to offer innovative products. The principle of compensation should not prevail over consumers’
interests and the need to foster innovation on the market. Hence, the governance of the entities in
charge of setting the fair compensation for copyright exceptions should be balanced to better reflect
all stakeholders’ interests.

For instance, the “Commission Copie Privée” in charge of determining private copy levies in France is
currently made of 12 representatives of right owners, 6 consumers associations and 5
representatives of devices manufacturers and 1 representative of telecom providers, the latter
accounting for almost 50% of the total amount paid according to SACD7. The very structure of the
Commission makes it difficult to properly balance the different points of view of the stakeholders
that together constitute the market. Furthermore, as the representation within the “industrial
college8” is not on par with their actual contribution to the total amount paid by each of the
industries they represent, there is a lack of balance and industries with little contribution to the
private copy levies frequently bring the whole system to a deadlock.

FFTélécoms points that:
   - In France, private copy levies for each type of device are set on the basis of their total
       storage capacities although storage effectively offered to customers (user storage) is much
       less (operating system and applications to operate the device use large part of this storage),
   - Storage capacities are present in a growing number of devices
   - Storage capacities in each type of device increase dramatically each year as the production
       cost of storage space diminishes
   - Meanwhile the time dedicated to the viewing of recorded content evolves at a much slower
       pace, especially so as the consumption of TV content has increased significantly over the last
       few year along with that of VoD, catch up TV content, music streaming, etc. and considering
       that individuals can only dedicate a fraction of their time to media consumption.

Consequently, there is a widening gap between the actual consumption of recorded content and the
amount paid to right owners under the private copy levy system. Such a system should be based on
the actual recording of content rather than estimates based on storage capacities.

  The « Collègeindustriel » is made of the 5 representatives of manufacturers and the 1 representatives of telecom

Altogether, harmonization could be reached by adopting a common set of rules in order to guarantee
“that equivalent conditions apply to rightholders, consumers, manufacturers and importers of
equipment and service providers across the Union”9. This objective could be attained by adopting
similar procedures across Member States in the assessment of the “harm” to rightholders. The issue
of the exemption and reimbursement for professional uses should also be tackled, as the procedures
that “have been introduced in the Member States are far from satisfactory”10, and further
harmonization would generate efficiencies at all levels and accelerate the transition to the digital
Single Market.

FFTélécoms believes that there is a need for further convergence in the private copy levies systems
at European level and that, at the very least, it should be ensured that the decision processes are
properly balanced. Such balance is necessary to strengthen the private copy levy system while also
allowing for those who create value, through private levy as well as through innovation, for the rights
holders.
