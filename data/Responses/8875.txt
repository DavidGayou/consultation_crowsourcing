Introduction
Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content  -  for information, education or entertainment purposes  -  regardless of geographical borders. 
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups  -  user-generated content and text and data mining  -  did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" and "Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders' remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
* Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in Europe?  
* [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights  -  e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law. 
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet  -  e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book seller  -  therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights Management should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences in musical works for online services; the structured stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the "same" service is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their "national" service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence). 
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the book sector, the issue of territoriality is fundamentally different from other sectors. The author grants a license directly to the publisher for the commercial exploitation of a work in the Swedish language. This means, that the publisher acquires a worldwide exclusive license to publish the book in the Swedish language. Publishers can therefor sell books through both online and/or brick-and-mortar retailers, across the whole internal market without limitations. This applies to both physical books and e-books, as Swedish publishers usually acquire digital as well as analogue rights. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a small number of cases, authors may choose to limit the publisher's right to publish in certain territories. This restriction is about author freedom, and not about copyright.

There is no need to take further measures at EU level to increase cross-border availability of books in analogue or digital formats. It might, however be necessary to facilitate identification of country of sale for VAT purposes, enhance discoverability of books and the making of devices and platforms that are interoperable. The copyright framework of today is not an obstacle to development or rights clearance. It is rather the lack of efficient protection for copyrighted content online that is holding the market development back.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
* [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software and databases.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.  
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission  -  e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available  -  and at the users' end  -  e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
The act of "making available" 
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of "making available" takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the "targeting" of a certain Member State's public. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are "targeted" by the online service provider. A service provider "targets" a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The making available right is in its current form sufficiently clear and crucial both to licensing and enforcement of rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)

[In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation 
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not applicable to the print sector where publishers generally acquire all rights which are fully transferred to the publisher by the author(s) for commercial exploitation. Publishers hold rights for reproduction and distribution simultaneously. We therefore do not see any need for legislation in that respect as in our field the two distinct rights do not create any problem.

Linking and browsing 
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. 
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swedish Publishers Association is able to endorse the views and conclusions expressed in a report of ALAI, available at: http://www.alai.org/en/assets/files/resolutions/making-available-right-report-opinion.pdf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hyperlinks per se should not be considered as making available when the link leads to an authorised copy of a work. The rights holder must however be entitled to set restrictions on access to their works. Where the link leads to illegally made available works not previously made available to the public, as it is with pirate sites offering link collections, then they should be covered by the making available right.  Automated restrictions on access such as prohibitions on crawling must be followed by search engines, or the search engines will be deemed infringers and/or contributory infringers.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual viewing of a page (from a user's perspective) should not be subject to authorisation when it involves a genuine act of temporary reproduction as a necessary technical process. However, the making available of copyright protected content on a webpage so that internet users can view it can and should only be done under authorisation of rights holders. Authorisations can be implied. Illegal display of pdf on websites and illegal streaming constitutes an increasing form of piracy of e-books and audiobooks, which becomes even more crucial at a time when commercial services are being developed that provide this same function, for example Storyside (audio books) and Readly (e books) in Sweden.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, rights holders should be able to decide whether a work is available for indexing by search engines.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

Download to own digital content 
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article). The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy). This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have "re-sold" it  -  this is often referred to as the "forward and delete" question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ability to resell previously purchased digital content would have severe economic implications on the book sector. Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the development of new business models and it is hard to foresee that the exhaustion rule applied to electronic content would be compliant with the three-step-test of the Berne convention.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several reasons why the conditions and approaches which apply with regard to physical goods should not also obtain in the digital marketplace. The simple assumption that because a certain approach works for physical it should, almost axiomatically, be made to apply to digital is overly simplistic. The attempt to straightforwardly transplant physical terms to the digital market ignores hugely significant key differences between how the markets operate. Ignoring these differences places the strength of the creative economy in jeopardy, in that creators' rewards and incentives would be eroded, along with the incentives and abilities of creative companies to invest in them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The underlying philosophy of the copyright framework is to give the author exclusive rights in the first-hand market, because this is where the greatest value can be derived and where they are likely to maximise their reward.  It also ensures that their moral rights are maintained.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the physical domain, it follows that it can be tolerated for the author not to also have full exclusive rights in the second-hand market: specifically the exhaustion of the distribution right can be tolerated as the author is deemed to have earned sufficient reward in his first-hand market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, this logic is drastically changed in the digital world because here the second-hand market is largely indistinguishable from the first-hand, owing to three vital characteristics of digital goods.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)	Digital works in the second-hand market are identical to the original of the work only in the sense that they contain the same work; however, physical works in the second-hand market are identical in the strictest interpretation of the term "identical": i.e. the second-hand work is one and the same thing as the first-hand work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)	Digital copies can be numerous, to a near-infinite degree, and therefore the second-hand market can be bigger than the first-hand market.  In the physical world, this is impossible since the second-hand market can only ever be as big as the first-hand market and is always likely to actually be smaller.  Given the trivial ease with which Digital Rights Management tools can be hacked and cracked, it is no comfort to say that "forward and delete" approach could solve this issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)	From these two points it follows that whereas digital copies are and remain pristine and faithful, physical copies suffer from deterioration.  This means that goods in the physical second-hand market are inferior to the first-hand (increasingly so over time) and so goods in each market are less substitutable.  For example, a dog-eared copy of "The Da Vinci Code" on its fourth outing on the shelves of a charity shop is clearly inferior to the brand new copy in a high street bookshop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The upshot of these three factors is that the ability of the author/publisher to earn just reward in the first-hand market would be severely curtailed by the untrammelled reselling of digital content. They would face unfair competition from the second-hand market, in which the providers of goods have borne none of the risk of investment in the creation of the product, nor have borne any of the production costs, other than the trivial cost of reproduction.  This would generate unfair price competition to the distinct disadvantage of the first-hand market. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, the impact on levels of online copyright infringement would be likely to be significant.  Monitoring unauthorised distribution is difficult enough in the prevailing conditions; however, it would become untenable to monitor and track infringement in a newly legitimised second-hand market in which there was no discernible difference in the product.  Pirate copies would be indistinguishable from the legitimate copies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, it is more difficult to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a physical sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing use of the physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case  -  both the seller and purchaser can continue to use the digital product.  The implications for widespread copyright infringement  -  and concurrent difficulties in enforcement  -  are clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor is there a significant consumer loss if the sale of digital second-hand books remains prohibited.  First, because the on-going sale of second-hand physical books would be in no way affected; secondly, because there is no clear discernible potential value to the consumer of selling second-hand e-books.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a further potential for harm to the consumer.  A rational response from authors/publishers to the challenge of lost value in the second-hand market would be to raise prices in the first-hand market in order to cover anticipated losses.  This would be a perilous strategy as it would entail losing further market share to lower prices in the second-hand market.  It would also impose higher prices on those consumers who wanted first-hand works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This idea is also based on a wide-spread false apprehension of the fact that e-books are cheaper than paper books. E-books are in fact not much cheaper to produce than print books; we estimate that digital production allows savings of about 15-20% (printing, storage and distribution)  -  everything else (paying authors, editorial, marketing, etc.) is still there in digital. In any event, only a tiny marginal proportion of publishers only publish e-books, almost all publishers need to publish in paper and in digital form, so the reduction of costs, for a market that is no more than 1% in Sweden and in the majority of Member States is not significant at all (the UK is an exception with 15% market share of e-books, France, Italy, Spain and Germany between 2 to 3% but most of the countries across the EU are counting less than 1%). Moreover, the digital market is still so nascent that there are still big initial investments needed to move to digital.  So all in all for the time being producing e-books costs about the same, if not more. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So for these reasons it has to be clearly acknowledged that the digital marketplace is importantly different to the physical one.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Registration of works and other subject matter  -  is it a good idea? 
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being considered.  
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The book publishing sector already has a voluntary registration system for the identification of books (ISBN), works (ISTC), and party names (ISNI), to assist with identification, discoverability and licensing. The book industry was the first cultural sector to create an international standard to identify books with the ISBN, which was introduced in 1965 and now applies also to e-books and educational software.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Swedish Publishers Association does not believe that any additional system of registration needs to be created and applied to the publishing sector.  We also reject the notion that registration should be a prerequisite for the protection and exercise of rights. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new environment is challenging in this area, since it requires standards for identification, description (to facilitate retrieval in the Internet) and formats, to ensure interoperability between different devices. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The identification and licensing of works and other subject matter is better served by improvements in facilitating discoverability; and in the streamlining of licensing. Publishers are working to improve both of these.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed `identifiers'. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have been developed, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database should, once operational, provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition was established to develop building blocks for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM)  -  a comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifiers are crucial for the efficiency and transparency of CMO operations. EU can support tools for rights information management and licensing by encouraging the interlinking of databases and improving metadata standards and identification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Term of protection  -  is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US). 

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of protection. 

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe the current terms of copyright are still appropriate. Book publishers do not benefit from a copyright term of protection but acquire rights from their author(s) for a certain period or the length of the author copyright term. The author(s) in turn receive(s) royalties for the exploitation of his (their) work. Intellectual property is a fundamental human right which like other property should be passed to the owner's heirs, at least for one generation and there is no reason, be economic or philosophical, to deprive an author from this right in the digital environment. This is based on a false assumption that the creativity input and dissemination effort would be less in the digital context. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a human right to express oneself in writing. When one has written something it should be assured that no one else can alter or use it without authorisation. The author should be recognized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A reduction of the term of protection could also be detrimental to the exploitation of a work as often authors need to wait the publication of more than one work before knowing some commercial success or often meet success at a later stage, e.g. after an on screen adaptation of their book takes place. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors and publishers must be able to enjoy return on investment, which the current term of protection provides if commercial success comes at a later stage. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It would not be fair if an author during many years has created a great work, if the copyright to the work, the property and right to decide over the work, suddenly expires after a shorter period of time. Greater respect should be given to creativity. It is also not possible to impose different terms of copyright to different works, so that "better" works would have a longer term of protection than "worse". We cannot have any authority deciding on the quality of works. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC. 
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders. 
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level), these limitations and exceptions are often optional, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market. 
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State "B"). 
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States' regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not see any specific problem arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions are optional for the Member States. There is no reason to make some of them "compulsory". Optional exceptions allows for more flexibility to tailor copyright frameworks. Differences between national copyright laws do not represent an obstacle to the creation of an online market for the publishing sector which is healthy and thriving.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead, the real obstacle to the online market is the threat of illegal downloading which prevents legal offers from being marketed on a level playing-field. We would need to see evidence that a harmonised set of exceptions would bring proven benefit without harming the current publishing market.

.............................................................................................................

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As explained in question 21, we disagree with the idea that some or all exceptions should be made mandatory. The fact that they are optional leaves room for the right amount of flexibility needed in a fast changing environment. Conditions of use of right are better served both for the users and the rights holders when handled through licence agreements, which add to the flexibility and serve users across borders if needed. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not see the need to add new limitations or exceptions to the existing catalogue. Any new exception should answer a market failure and the inability to serve users with licencing solutions. Licenses are the most flexible instrument available in order to meet each users' individual needs. New exceptions set prematurely in a fast moving world where technologies evolve very rapidly would certainly stifle business innovation and the ability of publishers to develop offers to serve new needs. The system with extended collective licenses in the Nordic countries makes it possible for right holders to react fast to the users' needs and has proved to serve users, right holders and the society at large in an excellent way.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain why 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.............................................................................................................
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current 20 optional exceptions with broad scope and wording offer the necessary flexibility, balanced with legal certainty. We do not believe that broader wording of exceptions would serve the purpose of better harmonisation. Broader wording  -  or any such change  -  would lead to legal uncertainty for both rights holders and users. Publishers invest in content and increasingly license it for digital transmissions and need to be able to rely on a firm set of rules to continue to deliver economically for the EU and morally for creator. We believe this is currently delivered via the 2001 Copyright Directive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
National courts and the EUCJ already play a central role in the legal interpretation of exceptions. However, introducing more flexibility and especially a general rule such as Fair Use into the EC legal system would only bring legal uncertainty, thereby challenging the ability of publishers to conduct business. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair Use in the U.S. provides a statutory defence mechanism to what could actually be infringement of exclusive copyright. This means that rights holders are forced to challenge uses in court after the event. The test is based on a century of U.S.-jurisprudence and this jurisprudence would not be readily available to the legal framework in Europe  -  indeed it would impose an unreasonably heavy burden of interpretation on EU courts as they struggle to reconcile two such dramatically different regimes. Users will lose legal certainty as the whole system will be far more dependent on the circumstances of each case. Cases such as the Google Book Settlement illustrate how big commercial players can exploit the legal uncertainty around the US doctrine to economically exhaust rights holders, who often cannot afford expensive litigation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that there is currently flexibility in the EU copyright system thanks to the space of manoeuvre left between EU and national legislation when transposing the EU copyright framework. This being said, any legislation, however technology neutral, runs the risk to be too closely tailored to business models and technologies of its day rather than allowing for future developments. In contrast, licences are by far the quickest, most flexible and most effective way of achieving technology neutral and targeted solutions. The system with extended collective licenses in the Nordic countries makes it possible for right holders to react fast to the users' needs and has proved to serve users, right holders and the society at large in an excellent way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It should be remembered that limitations and exceptions are by their very definition applied only in certain special cases where the Three Step Test has been complied with and therefor where there is no properly functioning licensing market. In contrast to licensing solutions that are continuously developed and improved by rights holders', exceptions and limitations can only be a blunt and often ineffective tool.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

Publishers frequently rely on exceptions, e.g. for quotations. Anyway, when possible, publishers favour licences which are flexible and balanced. Licences foresee uses across borders and can, unlike legislation, rapidly adapt to changing environments.

 NO OPINION

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the core of the problem from our point of view. In the current economic setting and with budget cuts occurring especially in the areas of culture and education, we do not believe that public authorities would be willing to compensate exceptions with cross-border effects if that meant spending taxpayers' money on benefitting tax-payers in another Member State. Licenced solutions are acceptable in closed networks of schools, universities or libraries, but if exceptions allowed uses involving communicating content on the internet (having potentially wide cross-border effects), it would be difficult, if not impossible, to compensate in a fair and balanced manner. It should also be remembered that Member States also have very distinct and separate systems for fair compensation, for example levies. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And we ought to remind at this point that it is commonly agreed also by users that authors and publishers need to be compensated for several current exceptions which undermine the original exploitation of their work.
* Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here. 
* Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films)  -  the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E  -  lending  
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Since the middle of the nineties, there is a model agreement in use in Sweden, between libraries and publishers, for the licensing of e-books to the libraries. The library's cost to lend one e-book to one patron, one time, was set to 20 SEK in the agreement. The sum was half of the cost of the administration of a printed book at that time. Half of the payment, 10 SEK, goes to the distributor, Elib, and 10 SEK to the publisher and author of the book, to be shared according to their individual royalty agreement. This model is still in use but both publishers and libraries mean that it doesn't work anymore. Publishers are currently negotiating agreements with libraries and most likely there will soon be different licensing solutions in place for the future.

There is no need for legislation on libraries purchase and lending of e-books. The Swedish book market is free and deregulated and the libraries are customers among other customers to the publishing houses. Any perceived problems can be solved by encouraging licensing and sharing best practices, but not by creating legislation which would prejudice commercial exploitation of books and inhibit the launch of new service and technical and business innovation. Publishers would like to find a solution that not hampers the commercial market of e-books.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The digital lending of e-books is combined with challenges for the libraries when it comes to their social mission to work for education and to promote reading. There is a risk that libraries become a place that attracts fewer visitors. Libraries remain essential institutions for readers and are a relevant part of the book world including the digital evolutions. There would be no more reason to maintain local libraries, as a single central service would be sufficient, if the traditional activities of on-premises and public lending would develop towards online developments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For publishers the change towards a bigger digital lending market is in competition with the commercial market.

 Mass digitisation
The term "mass digitisation" is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20[th] century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an "extended effect" to the licences granted). 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

It is not copyright that prevents digitisation projects but the lack of public funding.

National legislation works at national level and does not solve the cross-border aspect. It might be a right sui generis.

The system with extended collective licenses in the Nordic countries makes it possible for right holders to react fast to the users' needs and has proved to serve users, right holders and the society at large in an excellent way. There has newly been introduced a possibility in the Swedish Copyright Act for rights holders to enter into an extended collective license with libraries allowing mass digitisation.

Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

Swedish educational publishers offer a wide range of printed textbooks, teacher manuals and other learning materials for all subjects and classes in K-12. Publishers also offer a wide range of digital textbooks or other digital learning materials for all subjects and classes. There are both stand-alone textbooks with interactive features, components complementing printed textbooks and resources for interactive whiteboards. Digital learning materials allowing teachers to track the progress of each student are developed. At least one publisher has started to license modules and parts of books and all publishers are attentive to evolving needs of teachers.

Printed materials are delivered to schools from retailers or publishers directly. Digital materials are delivered on-line, usually on a one-year license basis. Skolfederation is an initiative, run by the Swedish national domain operator .SE, to provide a single sign-on solution for schools, which facilitates both access to and use of digital learning materials.

[Open question]
The Swedish RRO Bonus Copyright Access manages an extended collective licensing regime that works very well. In 2013, two new agreements were concluded for K-12 and higher education respectively.

The agreements allow teachers and students to make copies of fifteen printed and digital (including scanning) pages from printed and digital works, thus providing flexibility and the possibility to tailor educational materials from many sources. The agreements make possible distance learning, for which rights holders saw a need in schools and which was explicitly requested by universities. Licensed digital materials are not covered. The regime provides for cross-border renumeration.

A broad exception to copyright would undermine the educational mission of publishers. There is, moreover, in Sweden a well-functioning collective licensing system that is responsive to the needs of the educational community.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not clear that there is any problem that requires solution. There is no evidence that a harmonised compulsory broader exception would not harm the market, nor is there evidence of a market failure where some learning needs are not being catered for. Swedish collective licenses allow a lot of uses, and individual licences can complement these by allowing more, including cross border uses. Instead, Member States should be encouraged to maintain adequate budgets for education, including the acquisition of educational resources, both physical and  -  where possible  -  digital. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also need that the Commission ensure that interoperability is a criterion in public procurement, when providing for e-reading and/or e-readers material at school. There is a great need for a European policy of development of interoperability, standards and indexation. This would avoid the locking up of markets and the creation of dominant positions (for example on behalf of providers of technological solutions or internet access).

Disabilities 
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union) . 
The Marrakesh Treaty has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

Swedish educational publishers find current exceptions to copyright rules to facilitate the production of special formats required to give people with a disability access to copies of books. To provide for use beyond that, agreements are very important. Swedish educational publishers are, however, very much collaborative with institutions providing people with a disability with such copies.

Agreements between rights holders and trusted intermediaries are more important than the mere application of limitations or exceptions to facilitate the production of special formats when needed, and facilitate access to accessible copies of books. We believe that projects such as TIGAR (Trusted Intermediary Global Accessible Resources), hosted at WIPO, and ETIN, (European Trusted Intermediaries Network), are very valuable to overcome any technical or practical hurdles.

Publishers are publishing e-books in ePub3 format which incorporate the specification for accessibility outlined by the Daisy consortium and can therefore be made easily accessible for visually impaired people. Such files enable changes to colour, font, spacing etc., to assist the print impaired, and also reduce the number of cases in which unadapted files need to be converted under exception.
Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics are different terms used to describe increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.  
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the internet, open access). 
Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain "access" to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases). 
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of "Licences for Europe". In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data protection issues may arise of anyone was able to mine all content on the open internet, without appropriate check and balances.
User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called "user-generated content". While users can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not "new" as such. However, the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors as a result of the "Licences for Europe" discussions.

We believe that licensing is the best solution in this case, which is also a solution that respects moral rights. Licensing schemes has worked well with YouTube for the music and audio visual sectors. Non-commercial transformative uses are commercial in the sense that they generate advertising revenue for the platforms on which they are published.

Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and photocopying. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers' licence fees. 
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number of undue payments.

Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative industries. 
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.  Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is true, that the value chain for online distribution not is fair when it comes to illegally published works.

When it comes to the relation between authors and publishers: Publishers are naturally very much in favour of a fair remuneration for their authors. Ensuring this is a vital part of their core mission. Authors are associated to the success of their work, they usually receive an advance to complete their work and then royalties proportionate to the sale of their work. There are only exceptionally situations of buy-out clauses and lump sums to authors, as is the case with performers and audio visual authors. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contracts in publishing are based on individual negotiations. Collective author agreements are in place between some publishing houses and the Swedish Writers' Union. There is no central collective authors' agreement between The Swedish Publishers Association and The Swedish Writers' Union since 1996.

Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial purpose. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure. At the same time, there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 YES  -  Please explain 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that the current EU legal system framed by the 2006 Enforcement Directive is satisfactory, although some measures could be introduced to improve the civil enforcement system. It is necessary to strengthen respect for copyright. The civil enforcement system in the EU must be harmonized and rendered more efficient. The rapid evolution of the internet has created new ways to infringe copyright, which was not envisaged when the Enforcement Directive was discussed, adopted and implemented in Sweden. The political climate was also not in favour of rights holders, why necessary changes to copyright law was hard to introduce into Swedish legislation and new enforcement measures took long to decide. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some countries there are legal possibilities to have illegal websites blocked and there are reasonable collaborations with ISP's on the blocking of sites that give illegal access to copyrighted content. Blocking has been successful in promoting legal digital services. The blocked sites often contain a reference to legal sites and many choose not to try to circumvent the blocking. It is a way to change the behaviour of people. In Denmark the campaign Share with Care has proved that rights holders, ISPs, consumers and politicians are able to cooperate in reducing copyright infringements. In Sweden, we don't have any rule on blocking or any collaboration with ISPs on blocking or reducing copyright infringements. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EU Commission should review the level of enforcement possibilities in the member states to better ensure that digital content services are provided the same protection from illegal competition from illegal sites throughout the EU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sweden, the enforcement tool implemented through the IPRED-directive, is called the IPRED-law. It has not been sufficient to tackle copyright infringements due to a lack on obligation for ISPs to store data that can be handed out in civil cases. According to the IPRED-law, a rights holder can apply for a court order that obliges an ISP to hand out information about the identity of a person who had a certain IP-number at a certain time, from which it is likely that copyright infringement has been committed. The Data Retention Directive, implemented in Sweden 2012, only covers data that ISPs are obliged to store and hand out to crime preventing authorities. There is a lack of rules regarding the obligation for ISPs to store data that can be handed out in civil cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is also a lack of rules on code of conduct of the ISPs. There is an authority, The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) that monitors the electronic communications in Sweden. The rules that ISPs have to follow are scarce. They play a fundamental role in connecting people to the internet, why there should be introduced a code on their conduct, so that also rights holders interests are taken care of, not only the users.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does not make any difference when it comes to the damage it causes the rights holders whether the purpose of a copyright infringement is commercial or not. The distinction between commercial and non-commercial is unclear, as most of the "non-commercial" exchange websites benefit from advertisement revenues and, although it is difficult to measure, file exchanges and downloads do represent a loss sale. However, the priority is to go after the source from where the illegal websites are originating.    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Enforcement Directive needs to extend the presumption of ownership to holders of exclusive licenses or to assignees of copyright owners.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There could be introduced a producer right for publishers as they don't benefit from a "related right", in the same way music producers, film or database producers do. It is negative for publishers when it comes to digital copyright infringements. It is rarely the author but mostly the publisher that will have the resources to take legal action against infringements. Publishers have a need for a producer right equivalent to the producer rights for music, film and database producers. Publishers make investments in the publishing of books and that investment need protection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many digital services offering digital books, but they suffer from illegal competition in the form of download and streaming services for pirated audio books and e-books. The Swedish legislation is not clear on whether it is illegal to listen to the illegally uploaded streamed audio books and there is a widely held belief among the public that it is not. According a study by MediaVision, Svenska filmkonsumenter under lupp, 2014, the use of illegal streaming has grown by 500 percent over the past five years.

In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough to allow for  sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Swedish Publishers Association believes that clarification would be welcome when it comes to the involvement of intermediaries. We need a clearer legal framework for the ISPs responsibility, e.g. under the E-commerce Directive. See also answer above to question 75 on code of conduct for ISPs, monitoring their activities, and the need of rules assuring data retention that can be handed out to rights holders in civil cases. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sweden, there is no regulation on Notice and Takedown for intermediaries. There is a clear need for that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is also no rule that prescribes that rights holders can apply to the court for an order according to which intermediaries are imposed to block access for internet users to a certain site that predominantly contains illegally uploaded copyright protected material. There are possibilities to obtain court orders for internet service providers to block sites like thepiratebay in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Norway. Studies show that blocking is effective. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We regret that ISPs have not been willing to have a dialogue on illegal up-and-download.  It is necessary to come to workable solutions to tackling online copyright infringement. The collaboration with ISPs will be of primary importance in securing better respect for intellectual property rights online. ISPs provide access to the Internet and interconnect the underlying networks, host websites and servers. ISPs should have a responsibility to assist in tackling copyright infringement online, regardless of their accountability for the content itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We strongly agree that it would be useful to "clarify [that] injunctions should not depend on the liability of the intermediaries", and that the notion of liability of ISPs should be clarified when they can have several functions (hosting or editing).  ISPs have a responsibility to assist in tackling copyright infringement online, regardless of their accountability for the content itself. There is limited capacity in the national courts (as well as the limitation of rights holders' time and money) to bring the number of actions against infringers necessary to curb infringement.  Besides, as a first step, notice and take down procedures should be introduced in Sweden. Indeed the main problem arises from the difficulty to gather all the elements necessary for the notice and in particular to determine who the publisher of the website is, so as to send him the notice as the same time as to the ISP. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Search engines can do more to reduce online copyright infringement through preventive measures such as preventing automated  searches returning unlawful links and by responding efficiently to `notice and take down' notifications.  Similarly, links that receive a high number of notice and takedown requests should be deranked from search results.

Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Of course data privacy rules are capital to the respect of European citizens' right to privacy, however, they should not act as a shield to illegal activities. Instruments such as the Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) are essential to provide rights holders with the means to fight against piracy i.e. article 8 on the right to obtain information about infringements and infringers. The 2006 Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) requires ISPs to store data and communicate it to relevant authorities, but there is no obligation to store data and communicate it in civil cases such as the Swedish IPRED-legislation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One non-legislative solution could be to adapt contractual practices of ISPs to facilitate the transmission of data to rights holders. Currently, it is very challenging in most countries for publishers to face time-consuming and expensive court procedures every time their intellectual property rights are infringed online.

A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States' legal systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Open question] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not believe that a single EU Copyright title will bring any benefits to the development of content online, which is progressing well in the publishing sector. Differences between national copyright laws do not constitute an obstacle to the creation of an online market for the publishing sector. As mentioned previously, the publishing sector benefits from a healthy pan-European licensing system which is not stifled by the level of difference among the Member States legislation.
