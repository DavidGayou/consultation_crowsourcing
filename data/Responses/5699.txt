      Introduction

B.      Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 2 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 34 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now 5. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions6 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy" 7, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"8 and "Content Online"9. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

       Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

E.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

F.    [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions
and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law10.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps have
been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on
Collective Rights Management11 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial
licences in musical works for online services12; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences
for Europe”13 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content
Coalition14.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability15.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
10
   This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
12
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term16
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

     1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
        trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in
        which you live?

  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
 content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
 content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
 applications and other software)

     2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
        seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

  YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
 or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
 borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
 indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
 content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
 magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

      possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
      Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

[Open question]

Almost all works I published are available under free culture licenses, therefore I do not
completely track accesses. Access statistics show usage all over Europe. But many of my
works are unpublishable for me, though, because they build on other works. Due to that I
can only publish about 10% of the songs for which I wrote the text. When playing them in
private I get requests for them, but I cannot provide recordings. Also I cannot publish
recordings of the songs I learned as a child as well as old political songs – which is a special
irony.



   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
      what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Open question]

Fair-use rights for non-commercial use would make it much easier for me to at least share
those of my creations which build on other works which are not part of free culture. A
reduction of the length of copyright would allow me to share my recordings of the songs I
learned as a child.



   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for
      all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
      impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to
      ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European
      countries)?

                                                                                              10

          7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
             market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
             availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate
             level of protection for right holders?

       YES – Please explain

      Usage restrictions which apply in a certain member state put independent creators at a
      severe disadvantage and force them to give up their rights to bigger vendors who have the
      means to either acquire the relevant rights for all the relevant states or implement regional
      restrictions. As such national restrictions on usage of works promotes monopolies on the
      distribution of cultural works. Note that this effect is much smaller for additional national
      usage-permissions.

     G.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
     authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
A.   [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
     The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
     environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC17 on the harmonisation of certain
     aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
     field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
     software18 and databases19.
     17
        Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
     certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
     18
        Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
     of computer programs.
     19
        Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
     databases.
                                                                                                                11
     Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 20 which
     are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
     protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
     networks.

     The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
     authorise or prohibit the making of copies21, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
     e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
     at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
     communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
     dissemination of the works in digital networks 22. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
     transmissions and both need to be cleared.

B.   The act of “making available”

     Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
     upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
     “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
     territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
     need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
     only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
     countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
     Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
     a certain Member State's public23. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
     (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
     service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
     country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
     a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

          8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
             content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

       YES


       NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
      required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
      approach24)
     20
        Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
     respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is referred
     to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
     21
        The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in
     any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of a
     transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
     22
        The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
     or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
     23
        See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
     related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
     Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
     however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
     24
        The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must
     be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in
     which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member
     States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
                                                                                                                     12
      Targeting is a very unclear definition into which I as creator cannot trust. If Germany and
      Austria were to allow publishing of education material, and I would upload material in
      German language to a public server, would I then violate the copyright of the UK, because
      my content could also be accessed from there? How would I prevent accesses from people
      from other legislations - given that everyone could login to a computer in another state and
      download the content from there? If my readers were to use p2p networks to disseminate the
      files and a user in the UK would want to help German pupils get the materials, would that
      user violate UK copyright law? How could I ever make it clear that I really target German
      users, when I would want to make my content available via distributed caching proxies
      where every user hosts some files even if he or she does not download them?

      For me as creator, all these questions mean that I cannot take any decisions based on
      “targeting”. The clause essentially means that if a single member state of the EU forbids
      sharing one of my works, I have to refrain from sharing it in all other states, too.

      And in social networks, the notion of a target groups becomes completely unclear:
      Depending on the re-sharing of the recipients, the same act of publishing by the creator can
      reach only close friends or half the population of the internet. A specific example is the
      question “What can I share with my friends on Facebook?” If the answer to this would be
      “nothing”, then the laws would not support the daily real-life internet-usage of most people
      and as such would be unsuitable for any democratic state.

C.   Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

     Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
     law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
     transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
     licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
     persons/entities.
     regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
     copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

        Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
     an infringement of his/her right.

D.   Linking and browsing

     Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
     They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
     pending before the CJEU26 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
     a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
     public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
     A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
     works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
     memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 27 as to whether such copies
     are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided
     for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

          11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
              protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
              subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

       YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
      specific circumstances, and why

      ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

      ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

       NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
      circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
      public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

      A link should only be subject to authorisation of the rightholder, if it points to a resource
      which is not available to the public in any other way. If the link acts as a password which is
      not generally available, then sharing it may require authorisation. This is the case for some
      online-stores as well as for content which is made available on a server but which is not
      linked to in any way (this makes it effectively unpublished).

          12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction
              of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
              the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
              circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

      circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

      The way how downloaded documents are processed in the computer is a purely local
      implementation detail. Given the high speed of software development it is impossible to
      estimate the developments for even 3 years, much less guess what developments could
      occur within the lifetime of a law. Restricting the local implementation by copyright would
      seriously hamper the development of software within Europe. For example distributed
      caches which share content among computers in the same physical topology could strongly
      reduce the bandwidth requirements for providing streaming services and as such reduce
      costs for European Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

E.   Download to own digital content

     Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
     Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
     (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
     distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
     article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
     distribution of that tangible article)28. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
     also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
     (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 29. This raises difficult questions,

     28
       See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
     29
       In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
     hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited period
     of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
     exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in case
     of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise
     that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
     constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
                                                                                                                         15
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the
“forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

     13. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
         trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

  YES – Please explain by giving examples

 I bought watermarked PDFs. If someone else would be in possession of them, I could be
 liable, even if I sold them. So I effectively cannot sell them. This hurts, because I only
 bought them for a specific short-term need and I will not need them anymore after easter this
 year. In case of a physical book, I would just sell them - or give them away as present. I
 cannot do so for the digital files.

 I do not buy any files with enforced usage restrictions (DRM) because those require me to
 give up control of my computer to the seller of the work.

H.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute30. Moreover a system of registration does not need to
be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered31.

     15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
         and licensing of works and other subject matter?
30
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
31
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
                                                                                                             16

     16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

     17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

 [Open question]

 It would be a barrier for free culture: Casual creators would have to expend effort to get the
 full legal protection. Instead of this, the legal framework should be created in such a way
 that it still works if most citizens of Europe have copyrights on some works or parts of some
 works.



     18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

I.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
32
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       17
Linked Content Coalition34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub35 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

     19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
         content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
         ownership and permissions databases?

 [Open question]

 Europe should ensure that these databases comply to high standards of accuracy. An
 incorrect record is worse than no record at all and much worse than an explicit record as
 “unknown” (which can be adjusted as soon as new information is available).



J.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

     20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
         environment?
  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

 They are much too long - and this not only applies to digital works. In acoustic guitar music
 this means that I will not be allowed to reproduce works I learned as a child till after I have
 died. After the death of the author, copyright does not provide any incentive for that author

 to create further works, so the death of the author or authors should be the absolute
 maximum of the term of protection against reproduction.

 Ideally there should be two different terms: One term for attributing the author (which is still
 useful after the death of the author, because it allows the users of the work to find further
 works of the same author) and one term which provides a limited monopoly on the
 reproduction of the work. This latter term should be at most 15 years. Most works do not
 generate any noticeable further income after 15 years - actually most income is generated in
 the first year. Also since authors often sells these rights to distributors, limiting the term of
 the monopoly rights to 15 years also ensures that the authors can not be restricted from
 distributing their own works indefinitely, even though there is a strong imbalance in power
 between author and publisher at the beginning of the career of the author.

 A shorter term of monopoly rights can also provide an increase of interest in the author at
 the end of the term, as can be observed in the resurgence of works about the Cthulhu-
 Mythos directly after the end of the term of protection for the works of its principal author
 H.P. Lovecraft in 2007.

 If this had happened during the lifetime of the author, it would have provided him many
 chances for additional income. Instead he died in poverty, even though his later years were
 the most productive of his life. This is an example that a long term of protection does not
 benefit the author and as such does not achieve the goal of stimulating the creation of
 additional works.

       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC37.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law38. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 39, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional40, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the
limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
37
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")41.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If
a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-
border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university
in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be
a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who
should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either
to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the
authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree
of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while
ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

         provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

     22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need

41
  Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.
                                                                                                          20
 YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases

All exceptions which are general enough to warrant being part of a europe-wide law should
be mandatory to ensure that all european citizens have the same chances to take part in our
shared culture.

The example above shows how different exceptions provide legal uncertainty.

This should not stop states from creating additional exceptions, though: This allows local
experimentation with exceptions. Naming any non-mandatory exceptions would needlessly
limit the possibilities for experimentation implicitly to these named exceptions.

   23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
       existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

[Open question]

Most Youtube-Videos are plainly illegal under current German Copyright law while they are
legal under the fair-use clauses in the US. Having such fair-use clauses only in some states
creates unnecessary complications while not having them at all simply makes daily
interaction in the internet of most citizens illegal. I frequently experiment by asking people
on the train whether they know about what constitutes a copyright infringement. Most are
horrified when I tell them that most of the videos they watch on youtube are copyright
infringements and would disappear if copyright were actually enforced. These actions which
are customary for most internet-users must have a copyright exception in all member states
of the EU.

To legalize the customary internet usage of most citizens we need a real fair-use clause as
well as exceptions for remixing existing works and for non-commercial sharing of works.

   24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater

   25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.

       interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-
       use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what
       would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well
       as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]

   26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
       a problem?
 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

I mostly see this from the difference in fair-use between the US and Europe, though. I do not
actually know the differences between the exceptions in Europe which leads me to just not
use any work which is not explicitly under a free culture license.

I also do not use any works in scientific presentations which are not explicitly licensed
under free culture licenses, which greatly increases the effort for creating these
presentations.

 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to

 NO OPINION

   27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
       have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be
       addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays
       whom, where?)
[Open question]
Fair compensation towards another country would effectively be economic support for
another country. And as such it should count towards the payments given to and from the
European Union. A country which creates exceptions on some kinds of works must not be at
an economic disadvantage due to this.




                                                                                           22
     K.      Access to content in libraries and archives
     Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
     limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
     establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
     of preservation and archiving42 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
     matter in the collections of such institutions 43. The public lending (under an exception or
     limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
     governed by the Rental and Lending Directive44.

     Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
     envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
     the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
     exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
     rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
     stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

A.   Preservation and archiving

     The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
     cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
     works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
     works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
     laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
     from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
     types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
     of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
     new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
     content) is often uncertain.

          28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
              problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
              or other subject matter in your collection?
      (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
      by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation
      exception?
       YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

      Germany: University libraries cannot make works freely available but have to resort to
      complicated schemes were digital works are artificially removed from the catalog if
      someone uses them. This restriction is a leftover from treaties about numbers of copies of
      analog books and it leads to situations where students cannot access a book which they need
      for their courses.

B.   Off-premises access to library collections
     Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
     matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
     premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
     consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
     the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
     between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
     should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
     collections.
         32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
            problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
            to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
            thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
     (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
     problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-
     matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries
     when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?

     (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
     institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including
     across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of
     research and private study?
     [Open question]
     I have experienced sending me a link to a paper to read at home which I then could not read,
     because it was only available via the university network. I also experienced sharing a link to

     topic.


         33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

     Libraries should not be required to reconstruct restrictions from analog works when dealing
     with digital works.

C.   E – lending
     Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
     also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
     technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
     such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
     need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
     various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
     business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
     to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
         36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
            when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
            including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
     (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
     problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending),
     including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
     (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
     to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
      YES – Please explain with specific examples



                                                                                                  25
     As explained above, students in courses did not have access to books they needed. Also
     when I am at home, I cannot easily access papers to which my institute bought access,
     because the potential solutions to that are hard to realize with free software.

     The only works which I successfully lent from our university library are those which are
     provided in full, unrestricted digital format like a PDF.

      NO

      NO OPINION

        37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
      [Open question]
     By allowing libraries to utilize the full potential of digital goods for the benefit of society.
     Instead of buying a fixed quantity of books to lend, they could compensate rightsholders
     based on the average number of accesses of the works.

     The current scheme with buying a certain number of works is already an approximation of
     payment based on the number of accesses, because libraries buy more copies of works
     which are lent more often and for longer amounts of time (to ensure that they have a copy
     available when people search for it).

     The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one
     (n° 2).

         38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
             management of physical and online collections, including providing access to
             your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
     [Open question]
     ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

         39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
             libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending
             and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-
             lending? What problems have you encountered?
     [Open question]
     I see none. The purpose of a library is to provide the public access to the works regardless of
     the income of the citizen in question. That digitization removes artificial barriers between
     citizens is a big advantages which the libraries should use to fulfill their mission.

D.   Mass digitisation
     The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
     libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
     an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
     Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
                                                                                                      26
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other45. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)46.

     40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
         mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:]
         Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the
         results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and
         collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can
         be accessed across the EU?

     41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

L.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

        42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have
            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-
            matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
 (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
 resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration
 for teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain

 In my institute few people know about the options we have, so the current mechanisms only
 work because people simply assume that they are allowed anything as long as the material is
 only available to students. This leads to password-protecting all course-notes just to be safe
 and makes it impossible to record talks for public learning.

Directive 2001/29/EC48 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their

States level.

            you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject

 (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
 resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
 research projects/activities, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain

 In my PhD I feel like being in a straight jacket, because getting some data or program from a
 European institution just to test something is very complicated, so I mostly use data from
 US institutions instead which share freely. Also simply researching how the data we use
 from European institutions was generated can take days, because it is published in very
 guarded form - mostly without the software which generated it, because getting that
 software requires additional interaction with the administration and the IP department.

N.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC49 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 50.

The Marrakesh Treaty51 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

     50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation
         representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with
         accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States’

 When I could not touch-type nor use the mouse for two weeks (I could only click about one
 key every 3 seconds - do not let your child lean on your arm while you type), some pages in
 the internet became unusable for me because they relied on proprietary flash applications or
 non-accessible javascript. This prevented me from using the accessibility features of my
 browser to quickly jump to links without having to move the mouse exactly. The mediathek
 of the German public television was affected by this. This applies also to any other content
 which requires specialized readers instead of being delivered in a standardized format for
 which the reader of my operating system can provide accessibility features.

O.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics52 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
52
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.
                                                                                                31
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on
either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”53. In the context of these discussions, other
stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to which
access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific
exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction
between commercial and non-commercial.

P.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works, change
something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs 54.
User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if
the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results
from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the development of
social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content widely has vastly
changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic impact for those
holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of a technically and
artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to
all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom
of expression and the right to property.
54
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.
                                                                                                           33
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on
either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless,
a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial
activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and
licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders
and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the users
generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content and
facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across different sectors
as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions55.

     58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
         problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to
         disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?

 (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when
 users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-
 matter through your service, including across borders?

 (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting
 from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to
 disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?

  YES – Please explain by giving examples

 I only use pre-existing works when they are explicitely licensed under a free culture license
 like the GPL (GNU General Public License) or the creative commons Attribution license.
 Due to this I mostly stopped publishing recordings of songs. I do not reshare images nor
 create music videos, though I would like to. I refrain from this, because I know that this
 would violate copyright - so I take part in free culture which uses reciprocal licensing to
 create a pool of works which can be used for creating new works without violating
 copyright law. I also stopped using music for my roleplaying sessions, because this would
 disallow me to share recordings of these sessions. Before that I mostly used movie themes as
 background music.

 My main problem with free licensed works is that the creative commons licenses mainly
 used for music and images are incompatible with the GNU General Public License which is
 mainly used for software. This puts all free licensed game projects on very unstable legal
 footing.

      Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying56. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5758.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

         business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
 [Open question]

 If the levies would lead to a general exception for non-commercial sharing of works, this
 would remove a lot of complications and allow for a renewal of technically sane solutions
 like p2p networks as opposed to file-lockers and video-portals which require a huge
 infrastructure for a service that had already worked flawlessly a decade earlier with much
 weaker computers and much slower networks - and was mostly destroyed by the legal
 situation, even though people paid levies.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments62.

          Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers63 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 64. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

 reduced. I as rightsholder cannot estimate the effect of selling my rights for the next 100
 years, and as such I am in a very weak position compared to a distributor.

      Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE65 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text66. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested
that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of copyright,
measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is

safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

  YES – Please explain

 ……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO – Please explain

 The definition of copyright infringement with a commercial purpose is much too broad.
 With the current wording as of footnote 68, saying yes here would amount to saying that
 copyright enforcement against private users should be much stricter.

 Due to this I also object to the wording of the question. This is unclear and misleading.

     76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
         involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
         brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
         online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
         would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
 [Open question]
 Internet Service Providers, Advertising Brokers, Payment Service Providers, Domain Name
 Registrars and so on must not have a business in law enforcement. Law enforcement is a
 task for the state and as such all those private companies must be disallowed from getting
 involved in copyright matters - except when ordered so explicitly by a court.


     77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
         achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such
         as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?

The current civil enforcement framework criminalizes the daily life of the majority of
European citizen. Instead of trying harder to change the daily life of most citizens, the laws
should adjust to the new realities of a digital world and create new exceptions for usage of
copyrighted works in the private life which more and more happens online and in which the
borders between publishing and meeting friends are no longer clear cut.

         A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly Single
Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the same
objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

    78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
        a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
        copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
 YES

 NO

 NO OPINION


    79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
        current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a

It is not yet clear what purpose a European copyright system should serve. This must be
answered first and foremost - and in the interest of the majority of European citizens.

Today every single private citizen is in danger of being sued for copyright infringement for
such acts like clicking “Like” in Facebook or singing her or his favorite song and sharing a
recording of this with friends.

Copyright law gets more and more detached from the everyday life of people.

Instead of devising more and more methods of restricting European citizens in their personal
life - which more and more happens online - copyright should focus on the question how
European culture can be supported, a culture which more and more includes works by
everyday people.

Copyright is about supporting culture, not about creating monopolies for a few big
rightsholders. The ways how people share culture online should be supported instead of
being fought. Filesharing networks, collaborative culture production platforms and free
licensing should be supported explicitly through exceptions for private sharing and remix.

European Copyright law should have a stronger clause for fair use (not just the tiny
allowances for comedy), enabling the reuse of cultural works in the public discourse about
any kind of topic.

Also any kind of Digital Rights Management (DRM) should be forbidden because it allows
rightsholders to take away the rights European citizens are granted by law - like reselling
and reuse in education. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the state, and private
companies should not be allowed to take the law into their own hands.

Also to be effective any kind of DRM has to take over control of the users computer, which
violates the ownership of European citizens over the devices they bought as well as creating
an attack vector for crackers who want to harm Europe by industrial espionage, blackmail
European citizens or take over the computers of European citizens to attack critical
infrastructure.
