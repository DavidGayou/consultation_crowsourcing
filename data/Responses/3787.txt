Pearson response to European Commission public consultation on the
review of EU copyright rules


1    Introduction


1.1 Pearson welcomes the opportunity to discuss and debate EU copyright laws,
    in the context of the current changes affecting industry. On the one hand
    digitisation is increasing the power of consumers and inspiring new
    business models and innovation across various industries. At the same
    time, the nature and pace of change presents challenges for policy-makers
    and for business.

1.2 We’re seeing rising expectations for personalised services, and with that the
    development of new business models and substantial increases in the range
    and diversity of online resources. This growing range of online content and
    services is no longer tied to specific borders or territories, and it has
    engendered a new ecosystem of rights, permissions and identifiers.

1.3 This emerging online market for content and services is still being
    established. These changes are reflected in the role of the user: the general
    interaction, dialogue and informal sharing which all occur online means the
    distinction between users, consumers and creators is blurring. Evidence
    from other innovations online suggests that in this context, the
    development of these markets will not exactly replicate the characteristics
    of the physical market – we are seeing, for example, the growth of
    licensing via platforms rather than with individual users. Licences to display
    content are agreed with YouTube rather than with the end user, for
    instance. There is an opportunity for a new type of marketplace to evolve
    which is more sensitive to the needs of individual users, and simpler to use.

1.4 These nascent online markets will be important drivers of quality,
    innovation, enterprise and growth across industries in the future – but they
    are still very much in evolution. It is vital that we do not stymie at the
    outset innovative licensing programmes, which will ultimately support the
    digital single market. These solutions are encouraging investment in
    exploring and providing new services that meet with evolving consumer
    needs.




                                        1
1.5 Getting this right implies a different way of treating copyrighted works in
    the digital age. This will enable industry to clarify rights for creating and
    sharing content, and to provide new services offering a seamless user
    experience for those accessing content. We are exploring these markets
    and developing new business solutions to meet these needs.

1.6 For example, Pearson’s new efficacy commitment demonstrates in practice
    how emerging technologies are enabling us to address the needs of
    consumers and institutions in a different way. Education is transforming on
    a global scale, with new technologies on offer that can visibly improve
    learning outcomes and enhance access to education in developing
    countries. To grasp this opportunity, we are making huge changes in how
    our content and services are delivered and accessed, to ensure that our
    products and services personalise learning and meet targeted learning
    outcomes, and in many instances creating a more open environment for
    stakeholders and customers to access and adapt our resources. The current
    legal framework provides sufficient flexibility for us to provide solutions and
    innovations in this context. We need to maintain this flexibility to support
    our ongoing strategy as the approach matures.

1.7 For these reasons, we advise against substantial legislative change at this
    time. To meet the Commission’s objective for a thriving digital single
    market over the long term, any changes to legislation must be targeted and
    sensitive to the changes currently taking place in the market.

1.8 In the medium term, therefore, in order to resolve issues surrounding
    access to content arising from the digital sphere, we recommend that the
    emphasis of the Commission is placed on supporting initiatives to improve
    licensing and clarify rights and permissions, plus projects which set out to
    harmonise the interoperability of standards. This will serve to address
    issues around the use of content online, without disrupting commercial
    incentives to invest, undermining the rights of creators or creating undue
    risks to quality in sensitive areas like educational resources. This kind of
    strategy would also speak to industry’s need for stability and predictability
    in the legislative framework when making investment decisions. The
    Commission can also focus on specific areas for discussion around targeted,
    but sensitive legislative change. Above all else, we see a major role for the
    EU’s institutions in supporting non-legislative approaches to the
    development of tools to help the consumer and industries navigate through
    this increasingly complex rights picture. Pearson is committed to playing its
    part in providing solutions that will offer individual consumers and
    institutions the transparency and flexibility they need to access the range of
    content, products and services available.

2    About Pearson

2.1 Pearson is the world’s leading learning company, with 40,000 people
    operating across more than 80 countries. We have around 8,000 people
    working in the EEA. We provide educational materials, technologies,
    assessments and related services to teachers and learners of all
    ages. Other parts of Pearson include the Financial Times Group, which
    helps business people make well-informed decisions. Our goal is simple: to
    help people progress in their lives through learning.


3    Rights and Functioning of the Single Market

3.1 Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
    anywhere in Europe? – Relating to Questions 5 – 7

3.2 We aim to offer fair and efficient access to our content, in line with our
    values of enabling effective education for all. As often as possible, we will
    try to clear the broadest rights to our content, including acquiring
    worldwide rights, or at least making our content available on a pan-
    European basis. Indeed, there are few legal restrictions on accessing
    content across borders. We firmly believe this is the right thing - customers
    should not experience problems relating to territoriality when accessing
    publishers’ content across EU borders.

3.3 Territoriality is therefore not about legal impediments, but is actually driven
    by consumer demand and local considerations. For example, the majority of
    customers will gravitate to their local language when buying books or
    resources. Similarly, there may be a limit to the extent that Germans may
    want a book in Lithuanian, for example, meaning that there will be less
    investment by retailers in providing platforms to cover that particular
    customer requirement or to deal with specific technical issues around
    payment. Local considerations are especially important in the educational
    context. Particularly for our K12 markets, many of our educational books
    and resources will be tailored to individual Member States, taking into
    account their curricula, language, context and cultural preferences.
    Worldwide rights are less relevant for these types of educational products
    and we are less likely to invest in securing them. On the other hand, our
    Higher Education resources will more likely have worldwide rights, given
    their broader reach and remit.




                                         3
3.4 Copyright restrictions are therefore not actually to blame when, in some
    cases, access to content may be territorial in nature. Legislative
    intervention will be less important than developing on a cohesive system of
    rights management and interoperable platforms, devices and standards to
    enhance the user experience. Ensuring that this ecosystem works
    harmoniously is a huge challenge for industry, and one where EU
    institutions could play a role in providing research, best practice, stimulus
    and dialogue to resolve the complex issues arising in these areas. Pearson
    is focused on ensuring the portable nature of our content and services,
    across devices, platforms and borders.

3.5 For example, the Financial Times (FT) demonstrates our commitment to
    access and portability. It provides global licences to reflect the global
    nature of access to FT content. Over a third of the FT’s use is in mobile
    products, so it follows that customers should be able to access FT products
    across borders. In line with this, the FT’s HTML5 app is designed to be
    universal, working across platforms. The FT offers one price and one
    subscription model for access to its content, and once the customer has
    access rights, they're not tied to a particular country or platform and
    content is fully portable. Copyright is therefore not a barrier to enabling the
    portability of our content.

3.6 These principles are also echoed in our educational products and services.
    Pearson’s virtual learning environment Fronter can be accessed across
    platforms and devices, including mobile. Fronter’s code itself is open
    source, so that people can use it to develop their own solutions. Its
    software is accessible through browsers, enabling content to be integrated
    from other learning environments and cloud-like hosting services. Pearson’s
    international repositories, such as Equella, allow open access to learning
    resources which can be shared globally, between individuals and across
    institutions. Simple access to our services and content is therefore reliant
    on infrastructure that encourages interoperable standards and portability
    across devices and borders.

3.7 We also recognise the increasing challenges in managing the complex rights
    environment for content. Different systems, standards and attributions are
    used to manage rights for different pieces of content like text or images. In
    a cross-border world, however, consumers, institutions and customers
    rightly want to understand how they are able to use content. We are aiming
    to reduce the complexity of our rights acquisitions so that we can provide
    that clarity and offer simple licensing arrangements, for both our customers
    and our internal functions. Again, copyright legislation is not an impediment
    to access – it’s more a question of responding adequately to changes and
    complexities in the market. We are making efforts to invoke new acquisition
    models which remove traditional territorial barriers. We aim to apply this
    global and flexible approach to rights management across the organisation.

                                         4
3.8 As alluded to above, simplified access to content on a cross-border basis
    relies on improvements to the interoperability of platforms, standards and
    formats. Indeed, the Licences for Europe process recognised this fact, with
    pledges to promote the interoperability of formats and devices to improve
    access to ebooks across devices. Pearson is also working to achieve these
    goals, supporting initiatives such as the Linked Content Coalition and the
    work of the Rights Reference Model on interoperable standards. We are also
    the first publishing group to join the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
    working with the Digital Publishing Interest Group to align various formats
    used in publishing. We are also involved in the work of the International
    Digital Publishers Forum (IDPF), encouraging the development and
    adoption of the ePUB 3 standard to promote interoperability and portability
    of content across devices.


4      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
       authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?

4.1 Relating to Questions 8 – 10: The act of making available/ two rights
    involved in a single act of exploitation: We believe that the current scope of
    the making available right is sufficient. Applying a country of origin
    principle would have ramifications for other areas of copyright law and
    enforcement, particularly site-blocking cases launched by UK rightsholders
    to enforce their copyrights online. Interference with the making available
    right on too broad a scale could therefore have a range of unintended
    consequences, and should be assessed in dialogue with the relevant
    stakeholders. However, a closer look at the copyright Conventions
    governing the making available right, and, potentially, moves to resolve
    questions around the conflict of laws in different territories, may be areas
    of research to undertake by the Commission to resolve issues. We have not
    experienced problems in having two rights apply to digital transmissions.

    4.2 Relating to Questions 11 and 12: Linking and browsing: A balance
        must be struck between the reasonable expectations of the public using
        the internet - ie that they should be able to browse and view web pages
        and click on hyperlinks without needing authorisation each time, and the
        rights of content owners to protect their copyright. However, introducing
        additional layers of permissions around hyperlinking and browsing would
        make for a cumbersome user experience. The wrong stakeholders are
        targeted if end users must seek authorisation for each instance of
        hyperlinking or browsing on the internet - indeed, we try to make access
        to our content as simple and easy as possible. Rightsholders should
        therefore use licences and other tools to ensure that any intermediaries
        use their copyrighted content appropriately, without adversely affecting
        the end user or customer. Restrictions in viewing and linking to
        unauthorised content must also be in place.

                                          5
4.3 Relating to Question 14: Download to own digital content: Introducing an
    exhaustion principle to digital products, or enabling a second-hand digital
    market could cause significant harm for rightsholders if content is not
    sufficiently protected. Further, the concept of a digital resale market as
    currently envisaged essentially maps a physical secondary market scenario
    onto the digital world. This digital resale market could have far less
    relevance, and even become redundant in future, with the advent of new
    technologies in this space. It also fails to adequately take into account the
    importance of disseminating up-to-date content, which is particularly
    relevant in the education space. Technology offers an opportunity to get
    higher quality content to more users – but we need to tread carefully in the
    development of a digital resale market to secure that.

4.4 For instance, we often provide our educational content through an online
    support service, which is part of a wider subscription package. The package
    can extend to a whole database of content that updates regularly to keep in
    line with the national curriculum, and content can be modified by teachers
    and learners. This type of offer would have no physical equivalent, and so
    certainly couldn’t be resold in the same way. Similarly, legislation that
    draws a line between ‘download to own’ and other types of viewed online
    content may simply cause more confusion for users. Offline content or
    subscription-based products such as those offered by the FT could be
    improperly conflated with the ‘download to own’ ethos, when they are
    clearly different entities, and the creation of a formal distinction may
    restrict the ability of companies to come up with new licensing and business
    models.

4.5 ‘Open’ content is relevant here too, as the idea of ownership of content in
    the digital space becomes more varied. Many of Pearson’s services utilise
    open resources or open systems (as Fronter has done above) to enhance
    access and generate new ways of learning. We have also embraced Open
    Education Resources (OERs) in some of our products by working to make
    them more adaptable for instructors and learners. We’re currently
    assessing the quality of OERs by methodically comparing them to our own
    premium resources. We are also enhancing OERs by looking into adding
    services, such as assessments and certifications, to their content. People
    using these OERs will therefore be able to directly test their knowledge
    against the content used, making it more relevant and targeted to their
    learning. Again, resale markets become superfluous in this scenario.




                                        6
4.6 The current legal framework that we have does actually take the conditions
    of a digital resale market into account, but simply restricts it for a variety of
    reasons. Overriding legislation in this area may not take into account the
    nuances of buying, selling and trading online, and the clear differences
    between the analogue and digital worlds. Secondary markets in the
    physical world have worked so far for various reasons, including the facts
    that physical copies of works deteriorate over time and access to copies of
    works are naturally limited. But these frictions disappear in the digital
    scenario, as copies of works will never deteriorate and one copy can be
    passed on multiple times compared to a physical copy. A digital resale
    market could all too easily lead to infringement of our works if these issues
    aren’t addressed properly.

4.7 This all speaks to the fact that people are viewing, accessing and using
    content in different ways. The interplay between creating and consuming
    content is blurring. A balance must therefore be struck between ensuring
    that access to content is flexible and transparent, and preserving the
    integrity of rightsholders’ investments in the online market and the IP of
    individuals.

4.8 Licensing solutions with broad terms of use are the best way to address this
    issue - platforms such as YouTube, for instance, agree licences with
    rightsholders to display their content. End users aren’t caught up in
    individual licensing arrangements, content is legitimately accessed and
    viewed and creators are clear on the distribution to which they are
    agreeing. These new types of licensing agreements are responding to the
    new user demands and user experience online, and are operating in a more
    nuanced and responsive way than legislation is able. EU institutions could
    play a further role here in undertaking research into new business models
    delivering content, and assess the ways that people access and store
    content and the new technologies emerging. Research would help to better
    understand this nascent market and how we balance consumer demand for
    content with sustainable business models.


5    Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?/ How to
     improve the use and interoperability of identifiers – Relating to Questions
     15 – 19




                                          7
5.1 A register of works could enable greater understanding of consumer rights
    when creating, using and re-purposing content online. We are working to
    re-classify our content through our Global Unique Identifier Registry
    system, rather than only rely on traditional registration systems to identify
    our content. This should help to make our content more discoverable and
    therefore easier to access, as well as preventing inadvertent infringement.
    We also have the PRISM (Permission Rights Information System
    Management) database, a rights management system tool by which we
    track the uses of assets, giving simple and clear visibility to permissions
    information.

5.2 However, the creation of a register would not be without its challenges. It
    would have to meet a real market demand, and it should not act as a
    precondition for or be conflated with copyright. It will not be appropriate for
    all types of content, where it could face significant operational challenges
    (FT content is constantly being refreshed, so registration becomes
    inappropriate, for example). The ARROW project, however, is a good
    example of where a register can respond to a specific problem and demand,
    such as identifying orphan works.

5.3 EU institutions could have a role in researching the demand for specific
    types of registers, their impact and how they would work in practice. Note
    should be taken of existing registration systems, so as not to duplicate, and
    research undertaken into how these systems can interact with one another,
    also on a global basis. We would support moves to promote the adoption of
    identifiers, and again the Commission could play a role in understanding
    the related issues and encouraging new schemes.

5.4 We share the Commission’s goals in working to increase transparency and
    clarity for users when handling content, and we are supportive of relevant
    initiatives elsewhere like the UK Copyright Hub, the Linked Content
    Coalition, Schema.org and the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative which
    work towards these goals, and promote the interoperability of standards,
    formats and identifiers. The Licences for Europe process also resulted in
    pledges to work on these areas. The Commission should have a role in
    enabling the most relevant of these schemes to become prevalent across
    the EU, and globally. We would be pleased to share thoughts through our
    own work at Pearson, for instance our Global Unique Identifier Registry. We
    are also working with Creative Commons to explore licences for our content
    that are designed to address these questions. Though some of this work is
    at early stages, we would be happy to discuss these issues further with the
    Commission and in dialogue with other relevant stakeholders.




                                         8
6    Term of protection – is it appropriate? – Relating to Question 20

6.1 The objective of a change in copyright terms would be, presumably, to
    create more flexibility around the use of content. We think this end is better
    serviced by innovative solutions generated by industry, which enable access
    to content while preserving the author’s integrity. Where possible we are
    actively engaged in these activities, for instance in the negotiation of more
    flexible rights arrangements with our partners. We are working to make our
    content available for widespread use, be it art, images or text, through new
    and more open licensing arrangements. We are also negotiating with a
    range of external stakeholders to re-evaluate how our content is accessed.


7    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market – Relating to
     Questions 21 – 26

7.1 Targeted legislative change to ensure the best access to copyrighted
    content could be beneficial. However, harmonisation should not be applied
    across all exceptions, and most should not be made mandatory.
    Notwithstanding the technological changes taking place in online markets,
    important cultural and legal differences exist across Member States. The
    territorial nature of exceptions and limitations reflects this environment.
    Many countries will simply not have the infrastructure in place to
    accommodate newly harmonised exceptions, leading to confusion and
    uncertainty for the public and industry alike. The legal framework for
    copyright exceptions should therefore remain sufficiently flexible to take
    these differences into account (though there is no need for any further
    flexibility than that which already exists).

7.2 Industry initiatives should be encouraged to explain and help users
    navigate through any complexities of the copyright system, for example in
    the way that the UK Copyright Hub works. Any changes or modifications to
    exceptions must take into account commercial imperatives and impacts,
    and the existence of licensing solutions already meeting any intended
    requirements of an exception.


8    Access to content in libraries and archives - Relating to Questions 32(c),
     33, 35, 36(c) and 37




                                        9
8.1 Off-premises access to library collections/ e-lending: The issue of access to
    library collections is a disparate one given the range of libraries (for
    example public, academic, educational) and the subscription or lending
    models each employs. One size does not fit all in catering to different
    patrons’ needs, so lending and subscription models will often be based on
    the type of patron using the library – for example, students may prefer on-
    premises access to works to read particular chapters, rather than borrow an
    entire book, in contrast to patrons at a public library.

8.2 Further, new technologies are being introduced to ease access to works, as
    the nature of access to content changes in the online space. The increasing
    presence of open resource platforms means that there are also other ways
    in which we can respond to consumer demand for better access to
    information, and these enterprising new models will be developing
    alongside libraries’ own innovations. This again speaks to the idea that
    content is becoming more personalised and adaptive to learners’ and users’
    demands. Models for ‘flat content’ will be complemented by new platforms
    which allow users to interact with content that is more tailored to their
    specific requirements. Again, licensing solutions can cater to these nuances,
    rather than overriding exceptions, which could be detrimental to investment
    in business models responding to these developments.

8.3 In terms of our educational content (which makes up the bulk of what we
    offer to libraries) we will not normally negotiate agreements with libraries
    direct, but with intermediaries – library resellers – which will supply the
    platform for access to works, directly catering to the demands of library
    users. These agreements cater to ebook lending and remote access
    requirements. We work through flexible, contractual negotiations with
    library resellers where legal exceptions play little if any role, simply
    because the contracts provide the flexibility needed to meet the library and
    end user requirements. Cross border access does not appear to be a
    problem, as our contractual agreements define the agreed territory as UK
    and EU. Territorial restrictions normally concern countries outside of the
    European Economic Area. Library resellers can generally sell ebooks to
    members of the EEA. It is ultimately down to the library reseller to provide
    the access to publishers’ content, and they will manage all relations with
    the libraries. Resellers determine the lending models governing how
    content is accessed, and publishers are able to define some of the terms
    and conditions offered based on the lending model the reseller chooses to
    employ.




                                       10
8.4 This model allows us to directly manage access to our content, ensuring
    security and responsiveness. Contracts can be modified to take into account
    new developments or changes in technology, for instance. Certainly in the
    education sphere there appear to be fewer concerns in how remote access
    is being addressed, and the example above shows a clear working model to
    enable remote access to works. An overriding legislative solution would
    remove these flexibilities. Currently, we are enabling access to our content
    to ensure that students are successful in their studies, while at the same
    time managing that access to preserve our investments in content being
    offered.

8.5 We are supportive of reviews and research into existing library activities to
    support objectives of accessing cultural heritage, given the changing nature
    of user behaviour and emergence of new technologies. The need for
    preservation, for instance, may require new thinking and policy decisions.
    Issues have been raised in relation to ebook lending particularly in the
    trade sector, and pilot projects have been launched in response, such as
    those resulting from the UK Sieghart Review into public library lending
    practices. Importantly, the Sieghart Review recognised that crucial frictions
    in library lending models limiting the way that works are accessed must be
    maintained in the digital space. It also recognised that pilot projects
    encouraging licensing would be preferable to legislative change. The pilots
    will ensure that digital copies are not lent and shared profusely, which
    would ultimately have a direct impact on commercial markets. These pilots
    should be reviewed and further research conducted where appropriate,
    prior to proposals for legislative change, to give licensing solutions a real
    chance to resolve problems.

8.6 Overriding exceptions may not fully take into account the different ways
    that customers use libraries, and different solutions being promoted in
    individual sectors. Proposed solutions must be responsive to these different
    contexts, and prepared for the new technologies that might shape access in
    future.


9    Teaching - Relating to Questions 42(b) – 44

9.1 The teaching exception in the Information Society Directive is fit for
    purpose in ensuring that institutions have access to works for teaching
    purposes, and this extends to the e-learning and distance learning spheres.
    A problem emerges when the exception is implemented differently across
    member states: member states may have conflicting policies around the
    use of copyrighted content across borders, which could lead to issues in
    access to works for distance learning. We are open to further discussion on
    harmonising the objectives of the exception to ensure that distance
    learning is accommodated, similar to the De Wolf & Partners study’s
    suggestion looking into this issue.

                                       11
9.2 However, further harmonisation will not be without significant complexities
    to take into consideration. In our dialogue on harmonisation, we would
    need to understand how the harmonisation would take place, and whether
    and in what ways the current teaching exception might be amended.
    Crucially, the Commission would need to ensure that Member States
    implement the exception in accordance with the principles of the three-step
    test as enshrined in Article 5.5, or resolve concerns in this area as to how
    the rights of creators will be protected. Any further harmonisation of this
    exception must take into account these principles to ensure that it does not
    conflict with the normal exploitation of works in this area.

9.3 While some harmonisation may be helpful to the extent that is necessary to
    capture the needs of distance learners, this should not undermine the role
    of licences and resources available in the education sphere. In some
    member states this is being reflected in legislation. The UK government, for
    instance, is in the process of introducing amendments to the current
    exception for education in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act by
    updating it to allow for distance learning, and the exception can only be
    used if the copyrighted material is not available under licence. The modified
    exception will achieve the goals of the teaching exception in the
    Information Society Directive in allowing for distance learning, while
    recognising the role of licences in the education sphere.

9.4 One important advantage of licensing over an exception is that licences can
    reflect the changing nature of teaching and learning, which often no longer
    takes place in a classroom and can refer to a variety of learning
    environments and experiences. Licences cater to these individual
    specifications, but it is something that the Commission will have consider if
    amending the teaching exception or calling for further harmonisation.
    Exceptions may need to be more clearly defined to take into account the
    fact that teaching takes place in a diverse range of circumstances, and
    therefore content could be used in different ways, opening up the potential
    for more risk of infringement or arbitrary use.

9.5 A licence therefore should be the first port of call before reverting to an
    exception, to ensure the best results for all parties providing or accessing
    content. Licences offer a range of benefits, including personalising access to
    content, protecting users’ privacy and other security concerns, ensuring an
    ever-improving user experience and, increasingly, supporting adaptive
    learning. Licensing becomes particularly important to ensure that
    instructors are clear in how they can use content, so they can take into
    account libel considerations, ensure that the integrity of the works are
    being respected and avoid misattributions. A teacher’s use of a given work
    will vary in how they demonstrate the work to their audience, and licences
    will offer clarifications on adapting the content.



                                        12
9.6 Any harmonisation of the teaching exception must take into account the
    important role that industry investment is currently playing in driving new
    developments in this space: there is still much work to be done to
    determine what support is needed to maximise efficacy in online learning. A
    broad exception could undermine incentives for publishers to invest in
    creating high-quality and adaptive online resources, and limits our services’
    use of data to ensure as effective and personalised a user experience as
    possible. Pearson offers a range of products and services to enhance
    educational content. Examples include:

           In our K12 market, we provide ActiveTeach, a front-of-class online
            teaching tool that teachers are able to use through white boards to
            interact with the learning resources they might be using. Teachers
            and students can annotate and draw on images and content from the
            shared textbook, for instance.

           ActiveLearn Go allows learners to download core learning content
            straight to their personal mobile device, with added tests, multimedia
            and case studies to support learning. The product is suitable for
            vocational learners, whether studying at college, in work-based
            training or learning from home.


           The FT has recently released a new licence allowing its content to be
            used specifically for educational and teaching purposes. Through an
            open Application Programming Interface (API), students have free
            access to FT articles to enhance their learning resources. The FT also
            offers a royalty free licence for educational customers to reuse FT
            content.

           In the Higher Education market, through Pearson Learning Solutions
            we can customise ebooks for instructors, taking chapters and
            relevant texts from a range of different resources to create a
            bespoke learning product for students. We have provided customised
            ebooks for a range of Universities. One customised ebook acts as an
            accessible and affordable alternative to the usual habit of students
            buying a range of expensive books that they often won’t read. Use of
            the customised ebook has also resulted in students meeting a key
            learning outcome of improved engagement with reading matter,
            independently outside of the lecture hall.

           Pearson’s MyLabs and Mastering tools integrate with textbooks and
            learning resources to offer homework assignments, tests and extra
            activities between classes to promote better understanding of the
            subject matter. The tools also integrate with virtual learning
            environments, such as those offered by Blackboard Learn.

                                        13
           Pearson Learning Studio offers a package of services for distance
            learning. This is a virtual learning platform designed specifically for
            distance learning that allows teachers to create, store and share
            learning content for their students.


9.7 These innovations attest to a new ecosystem of accessing, sharing and
    even creating content amongst teachers, students and institutions for
    learning purposes. Through our products and services, and now particularly
    through our efficacy strategy, learning is becoming highly personalised,
    adapted to an individual student’s progress and understanding of key
    concepts, with the content in turn being broken down and refreshed on
    different platforms and multimedia. Open content also plays a role here:
    when it can be blended with the range of other learning resources on offer
    this will enhance the educational content altogether and drive new ways of
    learning.

9.8 In this new ecosystem, if we are to continue investing in creating resources
    that align with our efficacy strategy, we should have the ability to license
    our content so that teachers and learners can get the best out of each
    product. Our content can be disaggregated (indeed, we provide products to
    enable this), but too broad an exception could allow a teacher to break up
    content within a particular product in such a way that, not only could it
    undermine the investments put into elements of that content, but its
    learning goals and outcomes aren’t achieved. Legislative changes must
    therefore be sensitive to this market and encourage its development, if we
    want content to be more accessible and flexible, yet targeted to meet its
    set goals and desired learning outcomes. We will be happy to discuss these
    issues with the Commission in further detail.




                                         14
10   Disabilities – Relating to Questions 50(c) – 52

10.1 We support current legal frameworks enabling the cross border transfer of
     accessible files. We believe that the user experience is paramount here,
     and coupled with technological developments, this will provide market
     incentives for industry to increasingly provide commercial products which
     can be tailored around the accessibility needs of individuals. Over-broad
     legal exceptions undermine these incentives and can be harmful to the
     development of a viable commercial market for accessible works.

10.2 We are part of the TIGAR pilot project on enabling access to works across
     borders, and we will continue to support these kinds of projects. We are
     also leading the Accessibility taskforce set up by the Digital Publishing
     Interest Group within the W3C to encourage interoperable formats in
     accessible publishing. Finally, amongst the various initiatives taking place
     within Pearson, we have recently launched a UK accessibility policy
     ensuring that all our new digital services comply with W3C accessibility
     guidelines. This means that not only will existing services be tested for
     compliance, but we will be in-building accessibility standards into the
     design of new services. These projects are evidence of business solutions
     and proposals working effectively to improve use of accessible files.


11   Text and data mining – Relating to Questions 53(c) – 56

11.1 Text and data mining for research purposes is hugely important to improve
     our knowledge and understanding, and to discover new ideas and solutions.
     Text and data mining normally refers to academic research, but other
     sectors are also affected by this practice. For example, many argue that
     works that can be lawfully accessed should automatically provide rights to
     text and data mine at the same time. This would immediately bring a much
     wider range of content into scope, including content such as that of the
     Financial Times.

11.2 We recognise the research value of FT content and currently offer licences
     to enable text and data mining. These will normally be royalty free if
     content is being mined for non-commercial research purposes (see below
     for further details). We are open to suggestions for an exception relating to
     text and data mining at EU level, but the detail of the exception will be
     crucial here to ensure that copyrighted content is not arbitrarily exploited,
     that access is managed to ensure privacy and security, and that the current
     offer of licences is fully taken into account.




                                        15
11.3 An exception should only refer to non-commercial research purposes. There
     are issues around the definition of ‘non-commercial’, which should be
     addressed, but the point is that research outputs should not be for
     commercial gain if they substantially rely on others’ content. Again,
     however, licences could offer a way of remunerating each party involved
     should the research outputs obtain commercial value. Definitions around
     access to the content must be debated and clarified, to ensure that the
     exception is not over-broad in its scope and implementation.

11.4 Our support for research outputs is reflected in the FT’s royalty free
     licences for academic institutions to carry out non-commercial data mining.
     Their royalty free status meets the requirements of any proposed exception
     in enabling access for research purposes. The role of our licence here is to
     ensure that we have the ability to manage access to our content, thereby
     ensuring the protection of authors who produce the primary content. This is
     especially important in protecting journalism, in which there is a high and
     sustained upfront investment in producing content.

11.5 Licences not only ensure this accountability, but provide extra services that
     go beyond the pure copyright remit. First, management of access to
     content is important for a range of security reasons, particularly privacy.
     Licenses enable us to know who is accessing content and for what purposes
     so that our services and commitments to our authors and subscribers are
     not undermined. They also offer a practical way of ensuring clarity through
     a contract and reducing risk to both parties, for instance by specifying
     disclaimers, enabling adaptations to the content, mitigating against libel
     risks and correctly attributing trademarks. In this way, licences enable new
     services to be created. They can ultimately improve and personalise access
     to content, as they can be drawn up to take into account individual users’
     needs and requirements. Indeed, the Licences for Europe process
     recognised the importance of licences in the text and data mining space,
     with publishers committing to provide improved licences.

11.6 For these reasons, any exception must take into account the fact that
     licences are being provided and used across contexts. Where a licence
     exists to fulfil a requirement covered in an exception, the licence should be
     used before reverting to the exception to ensure clarity and the rights of
     both parties. An exception must respect the terms enshrined in the licence
     used to manage access to content, including technical protection measures.
     A proposed exception must ensure that any research outputs should not
     substitute for the original work being mined, in line with the three-step test
     and Article 5.5 of the Information Society Directive.




                                        16
11.7 In the context of this likely complexity in defining an exception, we would
     underline the flexibility that licensing solutions have been able to offer to
     users to date. In addition to our royalty free licenses, the FT has also built
     up successful business models to enable better access to news and
     research by providing the rights to mine its database. The FT has over 15
     licences with media monitoring companies, who create news alerts,
     abstracts and sentiment analysis as derivatives. Future business models will
     be created out of these templates, for example financial service companies
     deriving trading actions from mining a database of news, and new tools
     being offered providing easier and more efficient ways to mine. These new
     drivers of growth and enterprise could be undermined by over-broad
     exceptions that don’t take into account other sectors and business models.
     We would be happy to discuss these issues further with the Commission.


12   User-generated content (UGC) – Relating to Questions 58(c), 59(a)
     and 60(a), 61 and 63

12.1 UGC is an important but very nascent development. People are
     experimenting with content, for instance amalgamating it, re-purposing it
     and re-using it, generating new business models and ways of consuming
     content. It speaks to the new blurred lines between user, creator and
     consumer and the opportunities that come in this new digital environment.

12.2 It would be premature to legislate in this area at this stage, particularly as
     rightsholders are already experimenting with UGC in their business models
     and implementing licence models to ensure fair remuneration. The De Wolf
     study supports this sentiment with the conclusion that trying to legislate in
     this area will only cause more confusion for rightsholders.

12.3 For example, in some cases we now provide our users with the ability to
     assign a Creative Commons licence to the content they create within our
     products. We are creating new offers that utilise UGC, such as BlueSky,
     which allows instructors to combine content from Pearson textbooks, OERs,
     their own lessons plans and the Internet, to create unique lesson plans and
     content. A range of other products, like Equella, Online Learning Exchange
     and OpenClass also incorporate OERs and a range of resources for teachers
     and learners to access, amalgamate and share. We are keen to discuss
     these innovations and issues around standards in the UGC/ OER space with
     DG EAC in the coming months.




                                         17
12.4 In addition, through our Developers website, we are offering a range of our
     content, from FT articles to educational content, as open APIs for
     developers to convert into commercial and non-commercial applications. On
     the press side, the FT has clear terms of use and a range of tools to help
     readers interact with our content legitimately. Articles can be emailed to
     readers or ‘gifted’ to those without subscriptions. The FT’s Copyright policy
     clearly sets out how readers can produce ‘summaries’, which can include
     creating an original body of work that contains a certain amount of FT
     content.

12.5 Certainly greater transparency would be helpful for users to understand
     restrictions on use of content and to support them to know and exercise
     their own rights where appropriate. Developments in UGC should not ignore
     the basic principles of ownership and creators’ moral rights, entitling them
     to the assurance that their content is not used in unauthorised ways.
     Licensing supports these goals, as do the initiatives mentioned above such
     as the Copyright Hub, plus further research and support offered by the
     Commission. EU support for the various initiatives, business solutions and
     innovations can encourage this nascent market, and enhance our
     understanding of it.


13   Private copying and reprography – Relating to Question 64

13.1 We are supportive of a private copying exception, in that it meets the
     reasonable expectations of the public to be able to copy and transfer their
     content across platforms and devices. However, policy-makers must again
     be wary of the huge changes taking place through new technologies
     governing how we access content. The idea of ‘copying’ as envisaged
     through exceptions has become dated, as content is often simply shared
     across devices through licence agreements. To the extent that people are
     copying content without a licence, an exception should be narrowly defined
     to prevent abuse. Users should own the original and must not be able to
     widely transfer and share the content publicly, to protect investments made
     by rightsholders.




                                        18
14   Fair remuneration for authors and performers – Relating to
     Question 73

14.1 Contracts between authors and publishers should be left at Member State
     level. We do not believe this is an area that would benefit from intervention
     at European level given the very individual nature of the way businesses
     work and Member States function. Further, given the current pace of
     change taking place in the content industries, the use of contracts has
     become even more complex, and must at times be handled on a case by
     case basis. There will of course be a growing tension in the fact that as the
     availability of content becomes increasingly broad, the terms and conditions
     on which authors are employed must become more rigorous and specific to
     adapt to these changes. This will be part of a complex negotiation process
     that takes place between creators, agents and rightsholders. Broad-brush
     legislation in this area could therefore become obstructive and irrelevant,
     and will be unable to meet the different requirements for individual
     contracts and scenarios. For instance, we will acquire global rights to
     works, or contracts will be arranged to reflect the specific values and
     preferences of the author, or to meet the requirements of the platform
     through which the author’s work will be exhibited.


15   Respect for rights – Relating to Questions 75 and 76

15.1 We do not support changes to the civil enforcement framework, and we
     would prefer to work within the existing legal framework to enforce our
     copyright. The focus should be on ensuring that the systems are
     transparent for users to limit infringement, that education of users takes
     place and that dialogue between industry and technology companies and
     ISPs continues. We take copyright infringement very seriously, and
     scanning, photocopying and digital copying of our works is a significant
     issue for our businesses, which must be constantly controlled. However,
     shoring up legal redress often leaves most stakeholders unsatisfied, and
     pits one group against the other.

 15.2 Our FT tools mentioned above are a good example of where businesses
      can give clear terms of use and parameters for how customers use its
      content creatively. Collaboration at industry level is also ensuring that
      these types of issues are coming under renewed scrutiny. The Digital
      Trading Standards Group in the UK has recently launched UK Good
      Practice Principles aimed at reducing the risk of display ad misplacement
      on sites associated with inappropriate or illegal content. These policies and
      initiatives should be encouraged at national and cross-border level.




                                        19
16   A single EU copyright title – Relating to Questions 78 and 79

16.1 A single EU copyright title would be time consuming to develop and likely
     insufficiently dynamic, given the pace and scope of changes in the market
     and differences between individual member states, to which it is important
     we retain the capacity to be responsive.

16.2 We should instead be focused on enabling individuals and institutions to
     navigate a transparent system which is responsive to their needs, both as
     users and creators of content.




                                       20
