     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                                  7
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
XXX NO


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
XXX NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
The majority of our licensing activity is done through arrangements with Collective
Management Organizations (CMOs), Copyright Clearance Center in particular. We
support multi-territory licensing mechanisms for text works that are offered either
directly by rightsholders, CMOs, or licensing agents on a voluntary, non-exclusive, opt-
in, and market driven basis.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?


We have not encountered such difficulties but in line with our answer to question #3
above, we believe that the following approach would be well-suited address problems:
multi-territory licensing mechanisms for text works that are offered either directly by
rightsholders, CMOs, or licensing agents on a voluntary, non-exclusive, opt-in, and
market driven basis.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
15
   For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing
a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                     8
XXX NO


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
XXX NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
XXX NO – Please explain
We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that the Services Directive (Directive 2006/123/EC of 12
December 2006 on services in the internal market) should continue to apply to copyright
management services.


We believe no further measures are necessary to increase cross-border availability but
do support strengthening enforcement. We think that service providers and platforms
offering copyright-protected content, as well as search engines and social media sites
could play a greater role in raising consumer awareness for the need for copyright
compliance.


All stakeholders could benefit if such organizations worked more pro-actively with
rightsholders to create a legally secure environment for licensing that facilitates the
seamless and legal circulation of content. We believe this type of environment will
enhance the services of network providers and content owners and lead to greater
consumer choice, further growth, innovation and development.



B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this



16
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                         9
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
XXX YES



17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                               10
We believe that the “scope” of the making available right is sufficiently clear in civil
enforcement. In criminal proceedings the competence of enforcement agencies is not
always clear. The Internal Market could benefit from greater co-operation and co-
ordination in criminal law matters.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief23)?
XXX NO

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
XXX NO

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU24 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU25 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
XXX YES –

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

Hyperlinks are essential tools in online content delivery and part of the communication
process. Depending on the specifics of each case, they should not be subject to the prior
approval of a rightsholder, unless the rightsholder is entitled to set restrictions on access
to the materials. No further legislative action is needed in this area because the Court
jurisprudence continues to develop and important cases are currently pending before it,
which are expected to shed further light on these issues.




12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
XXX NO
Temporary reproductions that are incidental to an authorized act should not require
additional consent. However, we agree with the view that it would be too simplistic to
assume that all “cache” memory copies are “temporary” or “incidental”. The facts of
each case need to be analysed and this is best left to courts.


Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)26. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)27. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).




26
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
27
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              12
13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
XXX NO


14.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that the Copyright Directive does not foresee “digital
exhaustion” for the reproduction and making available rights (which are the rights
implicated in digital licensing) and limits exhaustion to the distribution of physical
copies by way of sale or other transfer of ownership. This is because digital
reproductions are perfect clones of their original and cannot be considered a degraded
copy as normally understood in the physical world. Also, “forward and delete” does not
seem enforceable given today’s technology.
We appreciate that this consultation has recognized that the ability to resell previously
purchased digital content would have severe economic implications.
An approach that introduces the concept of exhaustion to the right of distribution when
distribution takes place by electronic transmission fails to recognise the inherent
differences in physical and digital products. Specifically, the nature of digital goods is
that quality remains perfect over time, in contrast to physical goods where there is a
degree of deterioration over time. This means that the second hand market for physical
goods has less of an impact of the primary market, which can still function alongside a
secondary market. By contrast, the lack of deterioration in digital quality means that a
secondary market directly competes with the primary market and inevitably
undermines it. There would be no reason for any reader to pay for a new eproduct if
the identical file was available second hand at a lower price.
Further, it is impossible to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a
physical sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing
use of the physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case –
both the seller and purchaser can continue to use the digital product. The implications
for widespread copyright infringement – and concurrent difficulties in enforcement –
are obvious.
Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the
development of new business models.
License terms should therefore continue to be the norm in the area of text-based works,
such as journal articles and books. Both in the case of books and increasingly in the case
of journal articles, content is being sold at more granular levels, i.e. in chapters, extracts,
original and non-original datasets. Currently users may legally purchase access to works
or receive copies of electronic works and other subject-matter under a variety of
conditions, including temporary access, streaming, discounted purchases (including
combined discounts for print copies and electronic access), subscription access for a
specified time period, special formats and normalised formats for further automated
use.


                                                                                            13
Regulation aimed at allowing resale will stifle innovation, especially at the lower cost
part of the market. Laws which forbid restrictions on resale may lead to higher prices
and fewer options for consumers, and will make rightsholders more cautious about
entering into new digital markets and experimenting with new business models.



C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute28. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered29.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
XXX NO
We support the STM view that a voluntary registration system that would port
registrations obtained in one EU Member State to another could be very useful – i.e.
that the effect of registration would remain national, similar to the “Madrid” trade
mark registration system. This would enable rightsholders of text-based works to be
able to select an EU Member State or the EU as a whole as “country of first publication”
and that country or the EU central register could become the “base” registration
country.


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
Ownership information could be made searchable. Users and agents of users and
rightsholders would be able to identify potential licensors more easily. This could
contribute to a licensing environment that is fast, semi-automated, intuitive and
transparent. Particularly for the text-based sector, where licensing tends to be already
voluntary, non-exclusive, multi-territory and pro-competitive, potential advantages exist
further to lower transaction barriers.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Registration may place a heavy burden on creators and publishers, or become too
expensive if every title has to be registered. This would be especially true if they need to
be registered manually, rather than at the imprint or journal level, or one tied to
identification systems like the DOI, ORCID, ISBN, or ISTC. A registration system could

28
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
29
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             14
also be found to violate essential rights under the Berne Convention, e.g. Article 5. For
these reasons a registration system should not be mandatory and should offer benefits to
encourage voluntary compliance.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed30, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database31 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition32 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub33 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
The EU could promote the development of an EU copyright hub and encourage the
adoption of appropriate standards. In doing so, the EU could usefully look at some
notable initiatives at national level (e.g. UK Copyright hub, a gateway to information
about copyright and ways to licence or get permission to use third party works, see
http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/). The EU could also fund voluntary registration
systems adopted by rightsholders, or jointly by rightsholders and users.

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention34 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
XXX YES – Please explain
At the present time, we do not see a need to increase the term of copyright protection.
We note that orphan works legislation and voluntary, industry-led solutions for out-of-
commerce works in the publishing sector provide adequate mechanisms for access to
older works that lack a significant market or a steward. Moreover, in the field of
scientific, technical and medical publishing, publisher-agreed or negotiated embargo
periods for public access often may effectively reduce the significance of term of
protection for non-commercial research and personal/private study use.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC35.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law36. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 37, these limitations and

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
37
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

                                                                                                              16
exceptions are often optional38, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")39.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
XXX NO
We work with our licensees to develop solutions to their needs based on the specifics of
each case.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
XXX NO
We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that EU member states are guardians of cultural diversity –

38
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
39
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           17
one of the EU’s greatest assets. With that diversity comes different market traditions
and different stages of market penetration of available copyright-protected works. For
this reason, it would not be beneficial to force all EU Member States to introduce the
same exceptions with no opportunity for local adaptation.


We note that due to different market conditions an exception in one Member State may
be adequate, while in another the same exception could create a conflict with the three-
step test. Also, even if an EU level exception may be agreed verbatim and made
mandatory, the interpretation of such an exception would still require interpretation by
local courts unless every case involving an exception were sent to the European Courts
for guidance. The latter case could prove costly and introduce additional problems or
delays in enforcement of copyright rights.
Exceptions should also not be made “mandatory” by EU member states. Limiting the
validity of willing-buyer, willing-seller contracts will decrease consumer choice and
interfere with cross-border trade where licensing agreements could provide balanced
solutions and a clearer definition of acts permitted under licence, regardless of the
presence or absence of exceptions in any part of the EU.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

No, the current system is well-balanced with flexible and effective licensing solutions
increasingly being found between rightholders and users. We do not see the need to add
new exceptions to the existing catalog or reduce the number already present. New
exceptions should answer a market failure and the inability to serve users with practical
arrangements. We have seen no evidence of this. “Licences for Europe”, in which
publishers actively participated, illustrated that licences are powerful tools to meet user
demands and answer access or other problems. Premature new exceptions would stifle
business innovation and our ability to develop new products and services for new
markets and existing needs.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
XXX NO
The EU regulatory framework is sufficiently flexible.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
We note that fair use requires litigation. In countries such as the U.S. where it exists,
there is a long common law history interpreting the scope of fair use in a variety of

                                                                                            18
specific circumstances. Importing the concept to civil law countries could be particularly
challenging, and require years of litigation to answer even the most fundamental
questions about its scope. It would not add to the existing flexibility in the EU and could
result in excessive uncertainty.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?


XXX NO


When offering a multi-territory license, the variability of exceptions and limitations does
not play a role. What is important is that licensor and licensee have a common
understanding of what uses are going to be covered and how they are defined. In
practice, differences and uncertainty cannot be avoided by changing the territorial scope
of exceptions or by re-wording them, but only by way of practical arrangements and
clear expression of what is covered under a contract. EU or national law should
facilitate this process in legally binding ways.




27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


 Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving40 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions41. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive42.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.     Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?


(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
XXX NO


29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

In the digital and online world preservation as well as access problems are best solved
through public-private partnership, rather than through unilateral consumer rights or
exceptions. We participate in PORTICO, a market-based solution, which has provided
efficient ways to archive and protect scientific content, particularly electronic content.
For more information on this joint publisher-librarian project, see:
http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/. To date more than 300 million files have
been preserved in this way by Portico.

Portico illustrates that in the digital world exceptions achieve little if there is no enabling
framework – a point publishers have made as part of the text and data mining (TDM)
workgroup of “Licences for Europe and in the context of the 2011 MoU for out-of-
commerce works. Publishers have also made this point in relation to access for visually
impaired persons in the dialog leading to the Marrakesh Treaty facilitating access for
the blind and print disabled.

Because preservation of the scientific record is logistically and technically challenging,
we note that exceptions alone would not have accomplished the comprehensive
preservation that is currently being undertaken through publisher-librarian
partnerships such as PORTICO.



30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

                                                                                             20
None is needed.

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
None is needed.


2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
Yes. Remote access is a commonly part of our licenses for both corporate and academic
licensees. It is based on their need to provide access to global offices, distance campuses,
and staff/students who need to access material from off-site locations regardless of
where those off-site locations may be.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We have not encountered difficulties but where problems may be found, we believe they
would be best addressed through market-based licensing solutions.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
Legislation is not needed. Besides being unnecessary, it is too inflexible and slow to react
to changing digital market conditions.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


                                                                                          21
Not needed.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
XXX YES
By way of example we participate in three licensees for limited forms of document
delivery that in the context of the study could be described also as “e-lending”. We
would consider them a form of document supply on request. The first is with the British
Library for non-commercial document delivery abroad (into EU countries and
internationally). The second and third are framework agreements (one international
and one regional for German-speaking countries Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and
Switzerland, “GALS”,) with the German library consortium “Subito”. In all cases, non-
commercial supply of individual journal articles on request is permissible to
researchers, students and academics on preferential terms and for reduced copy fees,
while preserving the market for commercial supply of journal articles at ACS-set rates.
We are open to experimentation but wish to have a say in how our works are lent and to
have the freedom to experiment with the models that are best suited to our organization.
For us, one size will not fit all.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Any problems would best be solved by allowing rightsholders and licensees to continue
to be able to reach agreements, including across borders, and by ensuring that local laws
are followed by all parties.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]


                                                                                             22
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

We work with licensees to provide customized solutions to any problems they may
encounter – whether it be at the institutional, consortia, or national level. The supply of
documents on demand and at a distance (i.e. not for pick-up in the library) is in essence
a distribution function and has the potential to put libraries in a competitive position
with publishers that is absent from their traditional role. Where electronic resources are
concerned, we work to develop license terms to provide adequate ways of meeting
libraries’ needs as key customers of scientific technical and medical content without
undermining the sustainability of the system that makes this content available in the
first place.

As noted in our answer to 36 c, we participate in licenses with large consortia that
enable non-commercial document delivery on request at discounted preferential rates.
In these licenses, scanned materials from the permanent collection of a library are used
and not more than a designated number of copies from a journal annual volume are
delivered electronically on request. The quid pro quo for participating libraries and
consortia of libraries is that they agree on a process that is designed to minimise the
abuse of this preferential access beyond the intended classes of persons - e.g. academics,
researchers, students, certain social services or government departments as agreed.



4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other43. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible

43
          You will find more information about his MoU on                      the   following   website:

                                                                                                      23
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)44.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
XXX NO
We do not believe that changing national law is necessary. The MoU of 2011 does not
only involve national libraries and collective management organisations, but also
authors and publishers. Authors and publishers must work out any mass-digitisation
project with interested libraries and this is stated clearly in the MoU. Collective
management organisations then facilitate implementation of whatever underlying
principles have been agreed locally.


We are a U.S.-based organization but have signed on to the Safe Harbour Provisions for
the Digitisation and Making Available of Out Of Commerce Works forming part of the
Scientific, Technical and Medical Literature from the International Association of
Scientific Technical and Medical Publishers, the Association of Learned and
Professional Society Publishers, and Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of
the Association of American Publishers at http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_04_16_Safe_Harbor_Provisions_for_the_Use_of_OOC_Works.pdf .
Signatories to this statement unilaterally declare a safe harbour for those libraries and
users who undertake to abide by the MoU.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
XXX NO OPINION



F.      Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC45 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from

44
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Our licenses allow the use of ACS electronic content in teaching course packs. This has
been both popular and successful.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?

G.      Research
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
XXX NO
We are normally able to successfully address the needs of researchers and institutions
through our institutional and publishing agreements; member, document delivery, and
open access programs; and licenses with Collective Management Organizations. We
welcome opportunities to foster greater awareness of copyright-compliant and market-
based solutions.


48.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Same answer as in #47. The needs of researchers and institutions are normally best
addressed by institutional and publishing agreements; member/individual, document
delivery, and open access programs; and licenses with Collective Management
Organizations.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
Same answer as in #47. The needs of researchers and institutions are normally
successfully addressed by institutional and publishing agreements; member/individual,
document delivery, and open access programs; and licenses with Collective Management
Organizations.

H.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC47 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 48.

The Marrakesh Treaty49 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
XXX NO
We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that exceptions and limitations in favour of the visually
impaired are necessary and to the extent that they remain carefully crafted and
proportionate are justified by the public interest.
We believe that what matters is not widening or increasing the number of exceptions,
but making sure that the system provides for incentives for publishers and platform
owners, as well as intermediary software makers to work together to develop a
mainstream concept of access. In addition, accessibility is not only confined to the actual
content but to the discovery of that content.

I.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics50 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”51. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
XXX NO

ACS has signed the STM Declaration on Text and Data Mining, which has become part
of the “Pledges” of the Licences for Europe” process: http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_11_11_Text_and_Data_Mining_Declaration.pdf. The declaration is a
commitment to assist researchers and to facilitate and meet bona fide non-commercial
text and data mining requests. We have already provided licenses in this regard.

We will also be exploring participation some TDM projects expected to come online in
the near future:

(1) CrossRef's TDM service: Prospect <https://prospect.crossref.org/. This pilot project
should emerge from its 2013 pilot and launch in 2014. The Prospect service builds on the
existing CrossRef infrastructure to provide a common, standards-based cross-publisher
API and licence registry. The publisher adds two new links to each article's record in the
CrossRef database: first, a link to a version of the text designated for mining; and
second, to the relevant text mining licence (which could be an existing institutional
licence, or could be a click-through licence). Researchers will be able to select publishers
of interest, accept their licence terms and conditions, and then receive a unique Client
API Token. This key acts as an identifier to validate requests and make content
available. Prospect also allows publishers optionally to manage the load on their
platforms by specifying rate-limiting. Prospect will be free for researchers.

(2) NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicators: This draft recommended practice
http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/ addresses a similar issue to Prospect's licence
information links in much the same way, with a <license_ref> tag pointing to licence
terms specifying reuse rights (of which text mining could be one subset).

(3) PLS Clear http://www.plsclear.com/, a new service from the Publishers Licensing
Society, due to launch in early 2014. It will be a digital clearinghouse allowing
researchers to gain requested TDM rights from multiple publishers through a single
online form.

(4) Copyright Clearance Center TDM. This CCC pilot is exploring the development of a
platform that would not only licence but also provide access to a repository of XML
content. The CCC solution would allow users to mine subscribed (and open) content, but
also supports mining of unsubscribed content. Users can search across both
simultaneously, returning metadata for unsubscribed content with the option to
purchase.


54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Problems are best addressed by collaboration among key stakeholders to develop
market-based solutions that address legal and technological issues and enable lawful text
and data mining. Legislation is likely to adversely impact upon market developments by
discouraging innovation by organizations that do not wish to invest in technologies that
may be made redundant by legislation – and legislation is not the best tool to address
technological barriers to text and data mining.




                                                                                         29
55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
There is no need for legislation which may have an adverse impact on the activity it
seeks to promote.

56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Market based solutions are best. Useful and successful text and data mining will more
likely result from collaboration among parties who can evaluate needs, risks, costs and
benefits. We are already engaged in these discussions with users.


57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?


Technological and security issues are more significant than copyright issues. Text and
data mining has implications for websites and business models. Crawling websites for
text and data can adversely impact upon the security and technical performance of our
website. Uncontrolled access requests and crawling can cause server instability and
overload. In this way our services may be jeopardised and service degradation could
result to the detriment of all of our customers. Access requests that are not standardised
and not coming from known parties could point to system interference or other
unwelcome causes.



J.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs52. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
52
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           30
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions53.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
XXX YES
Even UGC not created for commercial gain can compete with legitimate products and
services and be picked up by sites with advertising and/or profit motives. We do not
oppose the incorporation of existing works in new works on reasonable basis, and
science publishing has a long tradition of allowing this, with community-developed
ethical rules governing issues such as credit. However, exceptions or statutory licenses
must be avoided or, at most, narrowly drawn for works clearly destined at private
consumption. The area of UGC is very complex and includes many different
phenomena, so that a one size fits all solution is not possible.


59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of
pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient
in this context?
XXX YES
We use CrossRef’s CrossCheck plagiarism detection service and identifiers such as
ORCID to facilitate the integrity of the scientific record. Identifying authors and content
is key to avoid plagiarism. Scientific publishing has customs and practices around reuse
which are not always abided in an online environment.


(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
XXX YES
Digital piracy and other unauthorized use of our content is a problem despite the
availability of copyright compliant solutions. Litigation is expensive but sometimes the
only solution. We participate in the 2012 STM Permission Guidelines for the re-
publication of pre-existing materials. Where uses go beyond those permitted, licensing is
available through RightsLink a transactional rights clearance engine facilitated by the
Copyright Clearance Center.

 IV.     Private copying and reprography
                                                                                       32
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying54. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5556.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions57 in the digital environment?


XXX NO
We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that there is no need since the Copyright Directive has
already put in place the basic principles to be applied to the private copying and
reprography exceptions and limitations. The non-mandatory character of such
exceptions and limitations has given Member States with enough flexibility to adapt
their legal national systems within the limits of the legality imposed by the EU
framework. The European Court of Justice plays a decisive role in the interpretation
and application of these exceptions.
Levies remain important in the digital environment, particularly on storage devices
(equipment levies). The small risk of “double payments” does not outweigh the larger
risk of “no payments” to creators and publishers. Moreover, to the extent fees are paid
by different entities receiving different benefits from the creative work (e.g., hardware
manufacturers and users), we do not see this as double-payment unless the specific fee
was paid twice on behalf of the same user/use.
Levies are never the preferred option to compensate rightsholders, but the last resort,
where a work has found its way to the end-user market and the end-user is likely to
make additional lawful uses that remain in the private sphere of the end-user. Levies

must be designed so that they do not prevent or interfere with the definition of
contractual relations between rightsholders and end-users and levies are also not meant
to compensate for piracy.


65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service
that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal,
be subject to private copying levies?58
XXX YES
 “Minimal harm” is not defined and for that reason we would recommend that
compensation not be waived.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
    services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
    different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on
    the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
Cloud computing services or other services permitting digital access of protected works
should not be covered by the exception, but subject to licensing. Moreover, the exception
is reserved to the private individual sphere and should not be the object of commercial
activities of third parties, as it would be the case if levies are applied storage in the
cloud.
Cloud-based services are fast developing. From the point of view of devising a levy
scheme, great care must be taken not to give the impression of a so-called “culture flat
rate”, which would only inadequately incentivize the creation of quality content. A
cloud-based service would present many challenges to a levy scheme, as fewer
permanent copies are likely being made by consumers and the storage device could
easily be a server farm based anywhere in the world


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?59
XXX YES
Levies paid on equipment purchased by professional business organisations should be
refunded on request. Business organisations cannot benefit from a private copy
exception and their internal copying must be compensated by way of a corporate
voluntary licence and not by way of a levy. By the same token, there is no reason why
such organisations should pay a levy when the equipment is used exclusively for
professional or business purposes. Any visibility of levies should not mislead consumers
into believing that they have acquired a right to reproduce and freely distribute content
beyond the limits of the exception.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments60.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers61 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract62. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
XXX NO
Competition and market based solutions are the best way to ensure fair remuneration
and licensing terms.

address the shortcomings you identify?

     VI.       Respect for rights

62
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           36
Directive 2004/48/EE63 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text64. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose65. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure66. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
XXX YES
We would support dialog with Internet Service Providers to improve filtering for
infringing content as well as the repeat posting of content already found to be infringing.
“Notice and Take-Down” in the latter case should become an automated Take Down
without Notice and “Notice and Stay-Down”. We support improving the efficiency of
copyright enforcement against infringements carried out for a commercial purpose.
We support the position of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) that, generally, the Enforcement Directive should extend the
presumption of ownership to holders of exclusive licenses or to assignees of copyright
owners, as the findings of the staff working paper also point out. Publishers do not
benefit from a “related right” in the same way producers of sound recordings or films
do, which results in publishers potentially lacking locus standi. Also, structurally it is
most often the publisher, not the author, that will have the resources to take legal action.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?


We believe that a copyright compliant digital environment would be facilitated by
greater participation of advertisers and intermediaries in inhibiting online copyright
infringement and support the position of the International Association of Scientific
Technical and Medical Publishers (STM) in this regard. Intermediaries are well-placed

of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
65
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
66
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           37
to assist in this process and include online services providers as well as ad brokers, ad
networks, payment providers, access providers, and search engines. Cooperation and
proactive measures could also be encouraged together with voluntary measures and self-
regulation. We support the STM position that financial sources and revenues stemming
from illicit activities should be cut back by a consistent follow-the-money approach.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
XXX NO
The balance tilts too much towards infringement.



   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
XXX NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
We support the submission of the International Association of Scientific Technical and
Medical Publishers (STM) and the position that the Commission should in the short and
medium term prioritise work on the enforcement of existing rules, the facilitation of
pragmatic dialogues and the promotion of voluntary solutions such as the 2011
Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making
Available of Out-of-Commerce Works signed by all stakeholders concerned.
