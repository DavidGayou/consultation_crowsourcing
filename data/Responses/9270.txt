     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.


3.[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
In the book sector, for the exploitation of works in the original language or in translation there
are no obstacles for the multi-territorial licences because there are adequate licensing
solutions available to provide cross-border access.
5.[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a
service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not
possible in certain European countries)?


X NO


7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
x NO – Please explain
Market-led solutions are the best way to increase cross-border availability in the text and book
sectors and their development needs to be encouraged, strengthened and identified through
mappings at EU level. Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) within Europe are
interacting and collaborating with one another to develop and/or facilitate new licensing
models if needed. This proves that multi-territorial solutions are possible under the present
EU legislation.

a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                                 9
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content
is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES



9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of
the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether
you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred
your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief23)?
X NO


2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
X NO


3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU24 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU25 as to whether such

23
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder?
X YES
If the work is protected and being commercialised, the rightholder should authorise the
hyperlink.
If the work or subject matter is already accessible and legally available online in the Internet
without commercial aims, no authorisation is required. See “Case C-466/12 CJEU Svensson
decision”.
However, whenever online content providers use these works which were originally set for
non-commercial purposes for their own or for third party’s subsequent commercial
exploitation there should authorisation from the rightholder and there should be provisions for
equitable share of the profits incurred through the use of the hyperlink in this action.



12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
X NO
Temporary reproductions on the screen or in the cache memory of the user’s device of a work
which is copyright protected and has been legally accessed, are not subject to the
authorisation of the rightholder, given that this is a necessary process in the majority of the
current ICT to make possible the act of reading online.


4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)26. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)27. This raises difficult questions,


26
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
27
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this

                                                                                                              11
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Reselling e-goods or previously purchased digital content in the book and text sector1
A “legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content” would be
highly premature if established without an impact assessment and an understanding of the
digital resale patents that have unleashed debates as well as court cases: The case of Capitol
Records versus ReDigi in the US Court is clear about the copyright infringement and in
particular the reproduction rights (Case 1:12-cv-00095 RJS Document 109 Filed 03/30/13
United States District Court Southern District of New York, No. 12 Civ. 95 RJS).
The consequences for the professional writers and the existing e-publishing markets need to
be investigated fully. In the EU the e-book market is still developing. The envisioned cloud-
based electronic marketplace for used digital objects or used e-goods has the potential to be
radically disruptive, among other reasons, because cloud services are still globally dominated
by a few USA companies and because the business models proposed would very likely
undermine the relevant economic model, with serious consequences for the EU Single
Market.
In the Amazon2 and Apple patent models the e-book becomes a “used e-book” once a first
legitimate buyer is no longer interested in it and then uses the option to sell or trade the e-
book to another user (a second buyer). If the e-book which is still commercially available is
more expensive, it is understandable that the potential second buyer can think ‘why but it now
when I can buy it at a reduced price as a used e-book in a few days’? The so-called used e-
book market would build from the primary e-publishing markets, but not within innovation or
competition since it would destabilize and disjoint the entire e-book value chain.
The Amazon “digital re-sale patent” would in principle aim at creating a secondary market for
“used digital objects”, although the plans still remain theoretical. The European Court of
Justice has ruled on the resale of software licenses which has been declared permissible (July
3, 2012). But in other sectors, the situation is complex. In music, MP3 song files are licensed
if bought through Amazon.com but are actual sales if the same are bought through a well-
known global e-tunes store. The question of when is a transaction a sale or a licensing is valid
for e-books as well, with further implications on the contractual agreements between authors
and their publishers (see our answer to Question 73).
There are multiple levels of issues that need to be thoroughly examined, including but not
limited to:
—Legal and policy questions: The first-sale doctrine or "exhaustion rule" needs to be
ascertained for digital objects since it does not apply adequately to the digital transfers of
identical e-copies or reproductions of copyrighted works which can be sent in large numbers
simultaneously throughout the world. This affects, on the one hand, the copyright owner's
"reproduction right" (making copies of the work) and on the other hand the "distribution


exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                            12
right". The distribution right in an e-book may be infringed when purportedly the “used” e-
book is “re-sold”.
—Remuneration and/or compensation to authors and other rightholders: The most important
issue for authors and publishers is that by calling it “used” digital objects the “re-”seller –
unknowingly or deliberately– avoids requesting authorisation from and paying remuneration
or compensation to the authors and other rightholders. The second-hand or used book market
shows that the rightholders do not paly a role in this parallel market.
—The ‘licensed’ or ‘sold’ legal concepts need to be further clarified for digital objects.
—Technological challenges:
A physical book literally changes hands when resold: E-books are different from physical
books. Although to many this is a self-evident fact, it needs to be reiterated. There is no
technical guarantee a) that the buyer will not keep the acquired e-book and sell as ‘used –
ebook’ a copy or multiple copies of the digital file through transfer in electronic channels, and
b) that many copies can be made of the same object without a specific form of control unless
state-of-the-art Digital Rights Management technology is applied, not without consequences
for the private citizen (see our next point).
—Privacy issues and the right to the protection of personal data: The sale of resale of
e-books can be appealing to consumers but it can be at the cost of their financial and
private data privacy. In the present models once the threshold imit of transfers or downloads
is reached, the content is locked by the digital rights management and the consumer, who does
not own the product, is unable to access the personalised data store.
—It is important to re-think not just the conditions for the functioning of the innovative user
models of access but also to reformulate and conceptualise anew the emerging forms of
content transmission, to avoid confusions or contradictions such as referring to the legal resale
of content that the consumer does not own.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute28. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered29.


28
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
29
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                            13
15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


X NO



17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Firstly, a registration system at EU level would have to depend on the national systems, and
on each MS’s ability and capacity to constantly update the data and to coordinate it with the
EU for which there is one essential requisite: interoperability. A centralised EU system could
not take care of all levels and repertoires, both in terms of technology and knowledge.
Therefore, if such a system would exist, it would need to address the different sectors, in
multilingual sites, with interoperability within the MS whenever this applies, and
interoperability at EU level.
If a centralised EU registry would be set up, it would have to be on a voluntary basis. There
can be no compulsory registration or the imposition of registration as a precondition for the
protection and exercise of authors’ rights and copyright.
The print sector has a form of identification with the ISBN number for the books in print.
Give the variety of types of works and publications a differential treatment is required for
registration. For orphan works, for instance, the ARROW system has been developed,
facilitating the work of libraries in their diligent search.
The most salient challenge would be how or who or what entities would monitor such a
registry.
The most important requisite is interoperability, in order to coordinate the currently existing,
emerging and future registries in the EU.]



D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed30, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database31 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition32 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the

30
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub33 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

 19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
All stakeholders from author to reader/consumer would benefit if the EU supports the
adoption of identifiers through the funding of projects to develop further the interoperability
and to promote and create awareness of the already existing identifiers such as the ISBN, the
DOI, and the emerging ISTC within the text and book sector. However, these identifiers do
not cover all the rightholders information. Therefore, for all sectors the EU can be a driver to
support the different industry-led hubs and in particular the databases that aim at providing
the identification of rightholders.
The Linked Content Coalition (LCC) (mentioned in the present EC consultation document)
has started the Rights Data Integration (RDI) project (in whose consortium EWC is a partner)
as a pilot to implement the work already done. As stated in the RDI Press release, the project
is partly funded by European Union’s ICT Policy Support Programme as part of the
Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme; it is based on the LCC “innovative
technical framework […] to help content owners and users to manage and trade rights for all
types of usage of all types of content and copyrighted works in all types of media.
RDI will bring the content industry a big step closer to meeting the challenge of how to assert
ownership of content and communicate copyright terms and conditions in the digital
environment in a way that both machines and people can understand.”1
RDI will bridge the rights users and the rightholders through the architecture of a central
information hub to facilitate the legitimate and legal use of online content. As such, it is a
good example of the role which the EU can play in this area.

Pave Way for Easier and Greater Legitimate Use of Online Content.” www.rdi-project.eu




E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention34 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and

                                                                                                                15
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
X YES
The current term of copyright for books (70 years after the death of the author) grants
sufficient time for the fulfillment of the right to be remunerated for the creation of works
which are of particular importance for a professional writer whose income and even post-
mortem financial obligations depend on it. It is also important to mention that in important
types of oeuvre, often the heirs continue to promote the author’ works for the cultural benefit
of citizens.
The current terms of copyright protection sustain a good balance between the authors and
their readers, and the (private or public) institutions that can make use in due time of the
works to incorporate them into the cultural heritage through the public domain.
We have noted in many discussions on the issue, that the general public or the general “user”
or “consumer” tends to confuse the “current terms of copyright protection” with the duration
of the transfer of rights, which are generally for a shorter period, provided that the relevant
clause in the contractual agreement between author and publisher has been fair and not
excessive. Awareness of this distinction needs to be raised.



 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC35.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law36. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)37, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional38, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of

35
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
36
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).
37
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
38
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.

                                                                                                           16
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")39.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


X NO
The optional character has allowed Member States to adopt limitations and exceptions that
suit best or that do not conflict with their respective national legislative frameworks and their
social, cultural and economic needs and interests, while enabling the internal market to
function, and allowing competition and innovation within the cultural industries.
It needs to be emphasised that in the context of copyright, exceptions and limitations in
national legislation must be compliant with the three-step test of the Berne Convention,
reiterated in EU Copyright Directive 2001/29, Article 5.5.




39
  Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                          17
22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X NO
A higher level of harmonisation would undermine the very flexibility which has made
possible the implementation of the EU Copyright Directive in the different Member States
according to their national legal systems.




23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Adding or removing limitations and exceptions will not provide any advantages and might
create the (erroneous) idea that all the EU stakeholder-led solutions and dialogues aiming at
pragmatic solutions and case-by-case evidence-based results of the past ten years have been
ineffective, whereas this is not the case.



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
     NO
The current framework in the optionality of exceptions and limitations and the three-step-test
in the EU Copyright Directive provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility and balance.




26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
X NO
See answers 21-24 above



A.         Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving40 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions41. The public lending (under an exception or

                                                                                           18
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive42.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28. (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use
by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
X NO
The preservation exception allows all EU national libraries in particular to digitise for
preservation purposes and to build the national heritage which in turn enriches the cultural
diversity in Europeand the world. Digitisation for preservation is recognised as an
indispensible act; however, it has not been carried out satisfactorily in all MS, and in several
cases (smaller MS or newest MS) it is because of lack of funds.


29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

As stated in our answer 28 above, funding both at national and EU levels more “digitisation
for preservation” projects by libraries would be important, provided that the funds cover not
only the technical aspects of digitisation but also the expertise and training and career
development of those engaged in digitisation, with expertise also for rights and copyright
knowledge .


2.         Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements

42
     Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

                                                                                             19
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
There are licensing solutions. Any exception would have to satisfy the 3 Step Test and
provide fair remuneration to authors. In most EU Member States the agreements in the
primary rights market are negotiated between the publishers and the institutional users
(whenever the authors have granted all these rights in their contractual agreements), or
between the institutional users and the Collective Management Organisations given a mandate
for this purpose by the authors or the publishers or in cases where an extended collective
license applies.
Along this line there is no barrier for the agreements to be adapted to online remote access, as
a number of current practices demonstrate; therefore, limitations to copyright in this area
would disrupt a system that allows the respect of copyright holders and that makes it possible
for the latter to receive the due remuneration or compensation, while facilitating off-premises
access for research and private study.


    33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Licensing has proven to be a legitimate and effective method. Moreover, the EC Stakeholder
Dialogues with libraries, archives, museums, authors, publishers, producers, etc. have been
instrumental in developing solutions to key issues in the field of the digital libraries since
2006; this was demonstrated by the work of the i2010 High Level Expert Group on Digital
Libraries and its Copyright Subgroup (in which EWC participated) which included but was
not limited to the report on orphan works and out-of-commerce works; the model licences and
key principles for out-of-commerce works, and the Memoranda of Understanding. Such
systematic framework of gradual consensus is a best practice. The main challenge remains the
actual implementation of the achievements.




35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


As we stated under question 33: The main challenge remains the actual implementation of the
achievements.


3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries

                                                                                             20
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36. (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across
borders?
X NO
Authors do not enter into agreements with libraries, because this is done by intermediaries.
The current e–lending practices are a result of the agreements between publishers and libraries
as part of the primary e-book market.
In several Member States the e-lending negotiations in i.e. pilot projects are being carried out
without informing and without engaging the authors. Authors welcome the possibility to reach
more readers in the digital formats, but if they are excluded from the information on how the
royalties are being handled in e-lending transactions, it will become difficult to build a
balanced e-lending framework.
There are several e-lending pilots in the EU, partly to investigate the types of business models
that can exist and that may work for libraries and publishers. The latter often license the
works to libraries through a software company.
There are also good practices: a balanced system is possible when all stakeholders come to
model agreements that will help not only sustain the e-lending demand but also help it
flourish.
The European Writers’ Council and the Federation of European Publishers (FEP) are
conducting a survey on remote e-lending or off-site lending of e-books by European libraries,
in order to have a preliminary mapping of the different business models, contractual
arrangements, technologies, and related factors being applied, and the results in the various
countries.



37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

The e-lending models and policy options are being analysed by several EU governments (for
instance, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France). One of the future options is the
extension of Public Lending Right to include e-lending, which would allow authors to receive
a fair compensation for the e-loans. Nevertheless, there are several EU countries where the
PLR system has not yet been implemented or is still under development; such a gap would
create a further or a double exclusion of authors in the e-book sector.

This type of e-lending licensing is not necessarily included or made explicit in the transfer of
rights from author to publisher in many cases throughout the EU. Therefore, the e-lending
loans are and will be handled by the publishers; moreover, as a unilateral action, the royalty
statements are not necessarily including e-lending remuneration.

The authors’ royalty remuneration for e-books in the primary market needs to be stated with
transparency in the contractual agreements (see our answer to questions 73 and 74). This
should also apply to the e-lending. There are significant differences in the royalty proceedings

                                                                                               21
in many EU countries, from 0%, to 5%, to 25% if e-books are positioned as “sales’ by the
publisher. However, in the e-lending models the works are being “licensed”. The contractual
agreements in the book and text sector make a substantial distinction between “sales” and
“licensing”, in the latter case, the remuneration is as a general practice divided equally
between both parties (50%) or at a varying rate of 40%-60%) (The Author, Autumn 2013, 83).

The models that will work in the near future are still imprecise: there is a need to find the
balance between the services by the libraries and the e-book market of copyright protected
works. The effective methods should allow the e-lending by libraries and the trade in the book
market to continue to exist while authors continue to receive their due fair remuneration.




4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other43. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)44.




43
         You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
44
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             22
40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X NO
This question is different from all the others in the scope of the consultation, but we take the
opportunity to refer to an important obstacle that needs to be addressed at EU level.
Although there are already some initiatives to implement the digitisation of out-of-commerce
works through legislation (i.e. France), the barriers that exist, from the authors’ perspective,
would not be solved with national legislation.
The misunderstandings, confusions and uncertainty as to who is the rightsholder when a
publisher has chosen to define a work as out-of-commerce because it is not interesting to be
commercialised further is a great obstacle. The root of the problem lies in the excessive
clauses in unfair contracts that in addition do not provide the option of rights reversion or do
not include the clear procedures to be followed by the authors to reclaim their rights. Next to
this we need to stress the hybrid form of Print-on-Demand which allows a publisher to keep
the author from reclaiming the rights of a work that has been declared out-of-commerce, often
with a minimum payment.
With the certainty of holding the rights to their out-of-commerce works authors either find
another publisher or they can give a mandate to the collective management association to
enter into licensing agreements with the library.

types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC45 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

States level.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC47 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 48.

The Marrakesh Treaty49 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

X NO


For many years authors have signed contracts that included the provision of special formats,
for instance, in Braille, for the visually impaired.
The European Writers’ Council fully supports the distribution and making available of works
in special formats, across borders, in the digital age.
51.If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
The European Writers’ Council has been working closely within The European Trusted
Intermediaries Network (ETIN) as co-chair representing the rightsholders’ communities. In
the course of developing the ETIN model instruments and the network several barriers have
emerged.
First of all it is important to have a clear identification of the intermediaries that can be trusted
to administer the special formats at national level, so that they can be recognised, as the ETIN
has put in place, through an accreditation system at EU level.
There is a need to form a cohesive network of Trusted Intermediaries working across borders,
and possibly within links by languages (i.e. Dutch and Flemish; French for Belgium and
France, German for Austria, Germany and Switzerland, etc.), or other options.
The Memorandum of Understanding needs to be further disseminated including among the
communities that will benefit from these formats and other interested parties.
More data needs to be collected at EU level, for instance on what impairments are recognised
by country. For instance, dyslexia is not in the list in more than one country. This means that
some groups cannot benefit from a cross border access if they cannot be considered among
the legitimate target beneficiaries.


52.What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
[Open question]


There are foundations and software companies. There are some collaborations between
publishers and software companies for this purpose.



E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics50 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast

50
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                                  25
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”51. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.




F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs52. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with

51
  See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content online”:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf .
52
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           26
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions53.

58.(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting
from the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate
new content on the Internet, including across borders?
X YES
Re-use of content is different from using the content of an original author, deleting his/her
name and attributing the whole to the ‘user’ (this is a violation of moral rights).
There are many and frequent cases, for instance, in the field of literary translations of poetry.
This is a real case, which has happened in Spain. A “user” copies and pastes a significant
number of translated poems in his website. This results in 80% of an anthology being
included. The rights of the selection as such belong to the publisher. The name of the
translator of each poem is deleted and the user/blogger publishes the translations and
appropriates them, adding a brief introduction. UGC has come to include this type of practice
as well, while it infringes the three step test.
There are many types of content that can be actually created, but the group Licences for
Europe did not discuss these forms.
This is a different practice from, for example, the mixing of music by a DJ, or the use of
different words and meanings in a new context.
Using content and generating content by re-use are different and need further discussion, not
only with all stakeholders involved, but most of all with a willingness to enter into dialogue.

experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of

in this context?
NO OPINION



60.(a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
X YES
There is a need for awareness about the rights of the creator, starting with the creators
themselves.
Many creators do not know how to be remunerated.


61.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Discussion platforms or dialogues amongst creators, with samples of works, and with the
participation of different players in the UGC market, and information about the different types
of licences that exist, including Creative Commons.




     IV.   Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying54. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5556.

cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

67.Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?59
X YES
It would provide transparency for consumers and authors alike.




Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments60.

68.Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue
levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers61 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract62. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The best mechanisms would be:
  — A legal EU framework that guarantees the balanced negotiations between individual
     creators/authors and their publishers and producers. This needs to include a legal
     protection to ensure fair remuneration.
  — Fair contractual agreements that are transparent and specific in terms of the rights
     transfers, duration and scope of transfers or licenses; remuneration for the different
     uses; schedules on payments; rights reversions, etc.
  — Model contracts mutually agreed between authors and publishers as stakeholders at
     national level.
  — To allow collective bargaining whenever relevant or necessary.
  — Availability of authorised collective management organisations and access to
     membership to allow the authors to give mandates to exploit and be remunerated for
     secondary uses of their works and remuneration collectively managed by CMOs.


73.Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?

The report Contractual Arrangements Applicable to Creators: Law and Practice of Selected
Member States, commissioned by the European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal
Policies, Policy Dept. C, January 2014, explored key aspects such as collective bargaining,
digital exploitation, imbalanced contracts, and reversion rights, etc. in eight Member States. It
demonstrates the need to take EU actions to remedy the imbalance in current contracts. This
can be done without opening the Directive. We suggest that the European Commission takes
serious consideration of the recommendations aiming at improving the level of fairness in
copyright contracts proposed in the study. Moreover, the Commission can complement the
data recorded in this report to obtain an EU mapping by conducting a study in all Member
States not included in the EP study. The publishing and text sector has very specific
conditions in contradistinction with the other sectors; therefore, more information needs to be
revealed in this area. The contractual agreements vary as well as the legal frameworks, but on
the whole there is a lack of provisions to safeguard fair remuneration for authors.Furthermore,
the results of the EP survey on contractual agreements show that authors are not receiving an
adequate or fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works, both in print and online or
digital.
According to statistics in some MS, professional authors are increasingly in need of a second
job to make a living. At the same time the publishing industry shows growing positive figures
about their earnings. A balance is needed. Not all creators are able to negotiate well their
contracts. The majority is faced with take it or leave it options. The most vulnerable groups
are the new or emerging authors and the authors who signed contracts assigning all the rights
for an indefinite period of time and for all uses known and unknown before the digital
productions started.
There are numerous excessive clauses in the current contractual practices that need to be
prohibited, including but not limited to the following areas:
—The transfer of rights, such as the waiver of moral rights in all its forms, the rights to future
and unknown uses; the transfer of rights other than the exclusive primary rights; thus, the
Public Lending Right and reprographic rights, private copy levies etc. should not be allowed
to be transferred; the ‘perpetuity’ of the transfer of rights for the whole duration of the
copyright.
—Clauses unreasonably restricting authors to submit future works to the publisher regardless
of the fulfilment of the contractual agreements or possible breach of contract.
—Clauses of presumption of transfer referring to future uses.
—Generic clauses that fail to differentiate and specify the distinction between digital and
printed exploitation.
—All inclusive clauses for secondary or subsidiary rights.
—Generic clauses on remuneration without specifying remuneration for different uses.
—Buy-out contracts (i.e. for literary translations, and educational or textbook writing)

74.If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]

First of all we respectfully ask the Commission to consider the Recommendations of the EP
report mentioned in our previous answer (73). Moreover, it is necessary to address the
contractual freedom, freedom of association (vs. competition law), and freedom of expression,
taking into account the UN Report of the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights,
Farida Shaheed, “The right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity”, (14 March 2013)
presented at the European Parliament in 2013 by the Art, Rights and Justice working group of
the Access to Culture Platform, of which EWC is an active member. In this context, certain
aspects of the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity
of Cultural Expressions still need to be implemented in the EU. From the report, we highlight
the following:
“Concern has been expressed about coercive contracts that authors and artists identify as a
primary obstacle to fair remuneration. Under such contracts, which are frequent, creators sign
away all their rights to their creation in order to gain a commission for creating a work.
Consequently, they lose control over their creation, which can be used in contradiction to their
own vision” (p.17).

Next, since authors transfer their rights there should be a fair remuneration in exchange.
The different forms of exploitation in particular the digital uses require a correspondence
between the different types of remuneration received by the publishers/producers entered into
contract also with the new players in the sector (i.e. aggregators, software companies, etc.).
Authors should be entitled to remuneration for these and all forms of exploitation; therefore,
there should be mechanisms to ensure that this happens.
—The protection of authors through collective agreements and model contracts should be
available in all MS.
—Equally important is the guarantee that clauses specify the conditions for the reversion of
rights.
 —e-book royalties and the remuneration for digital uses (offline and online) vary
substantially in the EU and is disproportionate in terms of the authors payment.
—Print-on-demand needs to be clarified, as it is frequently used by the publisher to prevent
the author from exerting a rights reversion to seek other forms of publication.
 —Fair remuneration needs to be made a predominant practice, for instance, through
proportional earnings according to the sales of the work. The German copyright act with its
“best-seller” clause is by general consensus among authors a good instrument to ensure
reasonable or fair remuneration.
—The rights reversion should also cover clearly the conditions under which a work becomes
out-of-commerce and how the author can exercise the reversion. The lack of clarity in the
contracts about this situation is a major barrier or a source of legal uncertainty in several
areas, of which we name just two: it prevents authors from seeking new forms of
dissemination of their work; it is an increasing barrier for the implementation of the
Memorandum of Understanding for the digitisation of out-of-commerce works.




                                                                                             32
     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE63 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 64. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose65. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure66. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
X YES


Effective copyright enforcement measures and protection against infringements are essential
and urgently needed.
It is practically impossible for authors and their publishers to monitor and handle the
unauthorised used of works in commercial contexts. The fact that legal suits are often the only
approach available signals a burning issue at EU level.
The unauthorised distribution of copyright protected works with commercial aims is in the
rise, directly and indirectly (for instance, users have to pay a fee to access the website to
obtain illegally accessed or reproduced works).
Piracy and the sustained unauthorised reproduction of works disrupt the well-functioning
market for creative content and the capacity of copyright as the economic enabler for authors.

A more effective copyright enforcement at both legal and technical levels would remedy the
current imbalance: it is necessary to have ways to detect, trace or identify the infringements,
to have clear mechanisms to make the infringer remove the illegally obtained or reproduced
works within a short period of time, ways of requiring that the infringing parties respond to
the complaints, and further measures to prevent that the works reappear under the same illegal
commercial situations.

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                          33
76.In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

The different national legislative approaches to implement the EU legal framework have been
responsive to the numerous ICT and technical developments of the last decade. Not all
Member States have actually implemented the EU legal framework yet.
One of the solutions is more concerted actions (i.e. cross border collaboration) to share know-
how and ‘what works’ to inhibit infringements, including soft methods, and awareness raising
and measures to allow the individual user to change and learn about good practices and non-
infringing behaviour.
The key role of the new players or intermediaries is not clearly defined and is insufficiently
addressed; the current legal framework of the Electronic Commerce Directive, adopted in
2000, could be updated in view of the rapid and multiple developments in online and digital
environments.



77.Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?

X YES
Under the subsidiarity principle, there is a balance in the context of respect for copyright.
There is a lack of balance in terms of private life and privacy data but this serious
vulnerability is not within the scope of the present consultation.
To a great extent in the “digital being” dimensions, the connected and ICT literate EU citizens
have become data and hence e-products; their private homes are being displayed through
digital maps available to all; they are subject to mass surveillance and other acts without their
knowledge, etc.




   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.


                                                                                              34
78.Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
as well as a single framework for enforcement?


X NO


79.Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term
project?
[Open question]

The framework of the Copyright Directive 2001/29 has allowed a balance through the co-
existence of different systems, namely, the copyright and the authors’ rights systems;
moreover, it has allowed the cultural diversity which is intrinsic to the EU to be strengthened.

Within the framework of the Directive the national legislative frameworks can grow or
change according to the relevant needs, and the same is valid for the policy improvement to
continue to implement it, and for each Member State to play an important role in the
contribution to culture and the economy in Europe.

For authors, the previously mentioned balance is fundamental to sustain their professional
creativity.

Any next steps that the EU would take in the development of copyright in the digital age
should not be based on a reopening of the Copyright Directive, but should build on what has
been achieved, and should hold visions towards the future.

The EC could undertake further initiatives through stakeholder dialogues, High Level Expert
Groups, and EU funding for projects that will facilitate the legal access to copyright protected
works. The EC IPR strategy needs further development; dissemination and communication
amongst and for the EU citizens would support the tasks of implementation by the Member
States.


Citizens need to have more accessible information for a better understanding of the
contribution of creators and the cultural sector in the EU economy, and of their role in culture,
creativity and innovation.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.


80.Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
The book and text sector requests that the European Commission devotes resources for studies
and impact assessments addressing the former’s particular conditions.
The solutions, pragmatic or otherwise, for music and other sectors do not necessarily work for
the book and text sector. A notable example is the field of translations.
Therefore, it is important to exercise a sector-specific approach, in particular for the
contractual agreements, including but not limited to the primary and secondary, subsidiary
rights.
