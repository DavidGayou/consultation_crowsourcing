          Name: UNI MEI Global Union
          UNI MEI Global Union (Transparency Register ID: 82864476764-79) represents 140 unions
          and guilds and over 375,000 creators, technicians and other workers in the media, entertainment
          & arts world-wide. EURO-MEI, the European regional group of UNI MEI brings together over
          60 organisations and 200,000 creators, technicians and other workers throughout the EU and
          other European countries.


          TYPE OF RESPONDENT (Please underline the appropriate):


              X     Author/Performer OR Representative of authors
              UNI MEI affiliates represent directors, writers, visual artists and other professionals
              involved in the production of commercials, television, film, and live performances. These
              individuals have author or co-author status in many EU Member States.
              Because UNI MEI is a global organization, some of its affiliates were established outside
              the EU but represent authors who reside within the EU. In addition to receiving author or
              co-author status in EU Member States, these professionals also benefit from collective
              agreements negotiated between foreign labour organizations and content producers.


              X     Other:
              UNI MEI affiliates also represent professionals, who are not considered authors or co-
              authors by EU Member States, but who nonetheless contribute to the production of creative
              works. Regardless of their authorship status under EU law, these professionals still depend
              on the exploitation of creative works for remuneration and future employment. This is
              because (1) collective agreements and private contracts provide for remuneration when such
              works are exploited, and (2) employment in the creative industries depends on the economic
              viability of creative works in the global marketplace.

Response by UNI MEI Global Union on the Public Consultation on the review of the EU
copyright rules

Introduction
As the representative of thousands of authors and co-authors, UNI MEI has a unique
perspective regarding the current review of EU copyright rules. On the one hand, we
recognise that new content distribution and consumption technologies present economic and
cultural opportunities for both creators and consumers. These opportunities warrant re-
examination of the current regulatory framework. On the other hand, our affiliates and the
authors, crafts people and all workers they represent have experienced first-hand the negative
externalities of new technologies, including reduced employment, declining wages, and
diminished bargaining power. As a result, and while we are not opposed to amending existing
copyright rules, we encourage the Commission to ensure that such amendments do not
support new technologies by undermining the rights of authors, co-authors, crafts people and
all professionals.

Indeed, preserving the acquis communautaire demands that we pursue growth only if it is
socially just and sustainable. Fostering such growth requires the Commission to adopt a
holistic approach to regulatory reform. For example, technologies that alter content
consumption affect its distribution; those changes in turn affect content creation, which alters
whether and how projects are financed; all of these factors affect employment and
remuneration in the creative industries. Amending current rules without considering each
aspect of the content supply chain could disrupt economic and cultural development. Because
authors are at the nexus of this economic and cultural web, it makes sense to also place them
at the heart of any policy analysis.

Such an analysis should begin with the following acknowledgment: any regulatory framework
that undermines the economic incentive to create high-quality content will be neither just nor
sustainable. Although technology growth has created new opportunities for content
production and distribution, the benefits of that growth in the digital marketplace have not
been shared equally by those who create that content. As we explain in more detail below,
authors do not currently have sufficient economic protections in the online space. It is
incumbent on the EU to address structural issues within the Internal Market to allow authors
and other creators to negotiate fair terms regarding their employment and remuneration in the
digital age.

Perhaps more importantly, the rapid growth of creative industries in the EU will be short-lived
if copyright rules do not promote employment and investment in creative works. This Public
Consultation assumes the existence of high-quality creative content. However, if new rules or
technology undermine authors’ ability to negotiate fair terms in the digital marketplace and
undercut financiers’ profits, creators, and investment in the creative industries will begin
drying up.

To avoid this scenario, it is critical that the Commission preserve and protect robust exclusive
rights in the digital marketplace. Those rights are what drive personal and financial
investment in creative industries. Whether they are motion pictures or sound recordings or
writings, creative works take years to develop and demand significant financial investment.
They often require the employment and coordination of hundreds of people, each with a
critical role, each bringing their own talent and vision to a project. These works are what
make the creative industries so valuable both culturally and economically, and this high-
quality content is the primary driver of technological innovation in the digital marketplace.
Absent enforceable exclusive rights, which support fair wages for authors and other creators
and permit a return on investment for financiers, these works will disappear.

                                                                                               2

  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?

Collective agreements negotiated between labour organisations and producers are the best way
to ensure adequate remuneration for all creators, crafts people and workers. The minimum
terms established by collective agreements prevent producers from exerting undue pressure on
authors and other creators to waive their statutory rights, but permit the parties to negotiate
freely for terms and conditions outside the scope of the agreement or in excess of the minimum
requirements. In addition, such agreements facilitate production of creative works by
establishing industry-wide employment standards and providing a framework to address broad,
industry-wide concerns.

For example, in the United States, collective bargaining results in appropriate levels of
remuneration for film directors, screenwriters and other creators and crew for each use of a
work, including exploitation online and in foreign markets such as the European Union. These
collective agreements have not been a hindrance to either the authors and other creators or the
producers who enter into them, partly because both parties have an interest in the successful
licensing and exploitation of the work. Ensuring fair remuneration for authors and other
creators also permits skilled and talented individuals to work full time in freelance industries,
where there are often long gaps between periods of employment.

By contrast, in the EU, various barriers prevent the vast majority of our affiliates from
negotiating meaningful collective agreements with employers. Without such agreements,
authors and other rights holders are forced to agree to “buy-out” clauses. These clauses transfer
all rights to employers and prevent individual rights holders from receiving remuneration for
their work. Because creators have little or no leverage in negotiating these terms, freedom of
contract is an illusion for authors and other creators in most EU states. In the meantime, talented
individuals leave the creative work force because they cannot support themselves in a freelance
industry without adequate remuneration.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
YES – As noted in Question 72, there are various structural barriers that prevent the vast
majority of our affiliates from negotiating meaningful collective agreements with employers.
Barriers relating to fair contracts, fair association, fair trade, and remuneration must be
addressed at the EU level if growth in the creative industries is to be just and sustainable.
Because these barriers are numerous and diverse across various EU Member States, they can
only be adequately addressed by action at the EU level.




                                                                                                 3

copyright rules

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?

Authors, other creators and workers and employers across all creative industries would benefit
from collective agreements. Authors, other creators and workers would benefit from
minimum terms and conditions guaranteeing proper remuneration, and industry producers
would profit from the stability, predictability, and the efforts of a cooperative workforce.

Perhaps the most basic action EU can take to address this issue is to facilitate dialogue
between employers and creators, crafts people and workers. UNI MEI, together with its sister
organisations, the IFJ, FIM and FIA, have repeatedly asked the EU Social Dialogue
Committee (“SDC”) to put intellectual property rights in the work programme of the SDC.
Specifically, we have asked the employer organisations represented on the SDC to enter into a
dialogue on remuneration. Unfortunately, we have made no progress. An initiative by the
European Commission to initiate a dialogue may facilitate discussions.

To the extent such discussions are fruitful, a European framework agreement between
employer associations and trade unions and guilds should spur further collective negotiations.
Such an agreement should define the scope of collective bargaining in the creative industries
and contain incentive measures promoting collective agreements at the national level. For
example, employer associations and trade unions and guilds could hold joint national round
tables regarding proposed and existing collective agreements dealing with remuneration for
uses of audiovisual works.

From a legislative perspective, a copyright contract law, like the one recently introduced in
Germany, might offer a way to promote such collective agreements. A copyright contract law
establishes a framework for collective negotiations without mandating specific terms. Such
laws also provide for freedom of association for individual rights holders regardless of their
employment status and authorize representative organisations to negotiate on behalf of their
members. A European level instrument that requires or encourages copyright contract laws
by Member States would help ensure adequate remuneration for authors and other creators
through collective bargaining.

Even if the EU begins addressing the structural impediments to collective agreements
immediately, current law still permits abusive contract practices that each day result in authors
and other creators waiving their right to remuneration. Therefore, regardless of its actions
relating to collective agreements, the Commission should take immediate action to curb these
abusive practices. We support a legislative initiative to establish a minimum terms and
conditions within the Internal Market, including proposals establishing an “unwaivable right”
to remuneration for the making available right. However, we support such a proposal only to
the extent that it does not adversely affect the negotiations or terms or existing or future
collective agreements or other remuneration methods in the creative industries.




                                                                                               4

   I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] How
often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
Authors and co-authors can and do usually assign their exclusive rights to producers,
broadcasters etc. who then exploit the work over one territory or on multi-territorial basis. This
transfer of the exclusive rights should be subject to fair remuneration for each use and territory
of the work.
Please also see answers to questions 72-74.



4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
Please see answers to questions 72-74.



5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not
possible in certain European countries)?
YES – In the area of film and TV production, in all EU Member States, territoriality is an
important tool in the pre-financing of works, in particular with respect to co-productions.
Further, exploitation of audiovisual works across territories requires substantial investment to
adapt the work to the linguistic and cultural context of each territory. Co-producing parties
acquire the exclusive rights for exploitation of the works in their territory(ies). The economic
incentive to invest in the production and distribution lies in this exclusivity. Without it, many
projects would not come to fruition. Territoriality is therefore economically an essential pillar
for the audiovisual sector in the EU Member States and needs to be preserved.




                                                                                                5

      III.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
NO – Member States can choose from an exhaustive list of limitations and exceptions that
account for their distinct legal systems and traditions. We are not aware of any problems that
stem from the optional limitations and exceptions in the EU copyright acquis.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
NO – Harmonisation will reduce flexibility for Member States that want to exclude certain
exceptions while hindering Member States that prefer a broad list of available exceptions. This
is because, if the EU exceptions are mandatory, the list will be renegotiated and likely reduced.
Certain exceptions that are currently available to all Member States will be removed to
compromise the varying traditions of Member States.
This exercise seems unnecessary in the absence of an impact assessment demonstrating the
need and/or benefits of mandating exceptions in the Internal Market. We do not see the benefit
to making any of the exceptions mandatory at this time.



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO – The existing legal framework allows for clarity and flexibility regarding the use of
copyrighted works. More importantly, it has not been established that increasing the number
of exceptions would provide any tangible benefit to EU, including in the areas of innovation or
creative output.
Because the relationship between copyright and innovation has been frequently discussed
within EU states in recent years, it is worth mentioning that some advocates of reduced
copyright law have repeatedly presented a false choice to legislators. They suggest that
governments must choose between encouraging “innovation” on the one hand, and
encouraging “creative works” on the other. This alleged trade-off is not grounded in reality
because technological innovation is not the sole purview of any one industry.

The creative industries are among the most technologically innovative in the world. Consider
just one of those industries: film and television. Many modern technologies - including
photo, video, editing, audio, special effects, and animation technology - were invented or
inspired by filmmakers striving to bring their visions to the screen. For example, James
Cameron spent years developing the technologies required to realize his vision for Avatar.
The efforts of Cameron and his collaborators resulted in ground-breaking, state-of-the-art
technologies, such as specialized cameras, 3-D equipment, and advanced performance-capture
techniques. Over time, technologies developed by or for the motion picture industry become
less expensive and more accessible to the general public.


                                                                                               6
Response by UNI MEI Global Union on the Public Consultation on the review of the EU
copyright rules

In fact, innovative technology and content developed by the film and television industry is
integral to the success of many Internet websites. Popular “mash-ups” depend on professional
studio footage, fan-fiction require film storylines, and news, gossip, and blog sites demand an
entertainment industry to follow and discuss. YouTube relies on amateur videographers who
shoot their films, edit their footage, write their music and mix their scores using industry
technologies and techniques. Across the globe, amateur animators utilize programs and
technologies that were developed for and tested by the film and television industry, and
amateur musicians’ record, edit, and mix compositions using software and tools also
originally developed for film and television scores. Specialized content delivery technologies
were also inspired or developed by the film and television industries. Few industries, if any,
have been the source of artistic and technological innovations that have had such wide-
reaching impact.

The question of what incentives spark innovation is a legitimate one that deserves
consideration and action. In the case of the film and television industry, strong copyright laws
have encouraged both entrepreneurial innovation and creative works. But they are not alone.
Businesses that lawfully provide copyrighted content via the Internet rely on copyright laws to
ensure their service is not undermined by illegal streaming and file-sharing services. Google,
Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other technology and Internet companies depend on
intellectual property laws to protect their patents and exploit their innovations, and many
high-tech software and hardware developers would cease operating absent strong copyright
protections.

For the reasons described above, we believe the Commission should be sceptical of those who
argue that increasing the number of exceptions will result in increased “innovation.” Across
the EU, robust and enforceable exclusive rights are not an impediment to technological
innovation – they are a source of it. And if regulatory initiatives are going “to support creation
and innovation, tap the full potential of the single Market, foster growth and investment and
promote cultural diversity”, then such initiatives must preserve intellectual property rights and
ensure an equitable digital marketplace across all EU Member States.


24.     Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree
of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
NO – The EU regulatory framework and ECJ jurisprudence provide significant flexibility,
which allows for new technology and services to develop. This is reflected in the myriad ways
EU citizens can now access creative content (e.g. download-to-rent, electronic sell-through,
monthly subscription, ad-supported streaming).
Question 25 of the questionnaire refers explicitly to fair use. We are aware that different
stakeholders advocate the introduction of “EU fair use”, based on the concept of the fair use
doctrine in U.S. copyright law. Fair use is portrayed as a panacea that will spur creativity and
“innovation.” As an initial matter, copyright and innovation are not inversely related. To the
contrary, and as we discussed in Question 22 above, copyright is a catalyst for creative and
technological innovation. But more importantly, fair use is not what its advocates imagine it to
be.
There are many misconceptions about “fair use” and how it is applied in the United States. The
fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law provides only a narrow affirmative defence to
copyright infringement, and it applies most frequently to small samples of creative work used

                                                                                                7
Response by UNI MEI Global Union on the Public Consultation on the review of the EU
copyright rules

for commentary, education, or parody. The applicability of the defence is determined by statute
and, more importantly, by over 170 years of legal precedent. Because fair use developed as part
of a broader copyright framework, its effectiveness as a legal doctrine cannot be divorced from
the entirety of U.S. copyright law. In other words, one cannot look at “fair use” without
considering all aspects of U.S. copyright law, including hefty statutory damages for
infringement, the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
copyright term extension, domain seizures, and recent judicial decisions regarding peer-to-peer
file sharing networks.

The professional content created by members of UNI MEI affiliates is the primary force driving
people to the Internet en masse. It is no surprise that many online businesses, dependent on
customers’ mouse clicks for their revenue, want to benefit by offering that content for free under
the guise of “fair use”. Those businesses would certainly grow, but that growth would be
neither just nor sustainable. Instead, it would be short-lived growth at the expense of an industry
that is the cultural backbone of many EU states. We believe the clamour for EU fair use should
be seen for what it is: an attempt to undercut exclusive rights to benefit those who want to use
freely content they didn’t create.


26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
NO – Please see our response to Question 20.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when such
compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
Limitations and exceptions established at national level should not have cross-border effect.
With respect to “fair compensation”, such compensation should be paid in the Member States
where the exception is granted.




                                                                                                 8

F. User-generated content


58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?


The EU Copyright Acquis provides sufficient flexibility for UGC: Articles 5 (3)(d), (i) and (k)
of the Copyright Directive already provide the necessary tools with respect to quotation,
caricature, parody, pastiche and incidental inclusion. These provisions together with new
micro-licensing schemes provide sufficient flexibility for UGC.




    IV. Private copying and reprography

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
private copying and reprography exceptions1 in the digital environment?
NO – We see no need to clarify the scope of application of the private copying exceptions. The
ECJ has provided and will continue to provide for clarifications.


65.    Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service
that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be
subject to private copying levies?2
YES – The exception for private copying and the need to provide fair compensation to the right
holders are clearly established in the EU acquis communautaire. Further clarification regarding
this exception, in particular the need for fair compensation to be calculated on the basis of the
harm caused to right holders by the act of copying, has been provided by the European Court
of Justice.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
Licensing and the private copying exception are complementary and have successfully been
implemented as such by a majority of EU Member States. This is because they serve two
distinct purposes: services are licensed to exploit protected content on the basis of the
business model they wish to promote. Private copying, on the other hand, is to enable end-
users to reproduce content for private purposes, regardless of the (new) business model
enabling them to access such content. There is no evidence that private copying levies have a
negative impact on the development of new business models. The rapid multiplication of new
online services on an ever increasing number of devices speaks for itself. A major attractive
feature of these services and devices are that they enable private copying.



76.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?3
YES – We support such a measure in order to increase transparency of levies and awareness of
citizens.




  II. Respect for rights

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
YES – Efficient enforcement is important to ensure the respect for rights. At the same time,
efforts by authorities and industry to better inform and educate consumers are indispensable to
raise the awareness of the importance to protect creative content in order to sustain creativity,
employment and cultural development of our societies.

The Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights is a relevant, useful
and balanced tool for enforcement, and requires as such proper implementation by the Member
States. However, it cannot adequately tackle the challenges raised by the development of
broadband Internet. Since 2004, the online legal exploitation of copyrighted works and recorded
performances has increased. The Internet’s multi-purpose nature has made IP rights
infringements even easier: file sharing may now occur through either downloading or streaming
and is facilitated by dedicated search engines.

This situation is particularly worrying for authors, and other creators, as it may directly impact

  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                           10

copyright rules

their remunerations. Moreover, as the unauthorised online use of protected contents negatively
impacts on the creative industries’ revenues and investment capacities, job opportunities for
creators, crafts people and all other workers in the sector are also affected. The measures that
have been or are being developed at national level, based on current EU legislation, may not be
sufficient to properly address the widespread and unauthorised access to protected contents
online, with the level of coherence that is needed for these measures to be truly effective in a
multi territorial environment.

As we have submitted during the public consultation on civil enforcement of intellectual
property rights of 2013 it should be assessed whether it may be appropriate to revise the
directive and render its implementation more coherent. Such a revision would only lead to
increased efficiency if it does not offer an opportunity to lower the level of protection,
addresses shortcomings or ambiguities that could lead to diverging interpretations at national
level and facilitates harmonisation at a higher level, especially on areas that are not currently
or clearly covered. New policies need to take due care for the protection of personal data,
privacy and other fundamental rights.
