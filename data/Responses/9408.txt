     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council
Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore

modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online

11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

GENERAL COMMENT

This consultation presupposes that issues surrounding the territoriality of rights affect all
content sectors. However, this is not the case with the publishing sector where the granting
of and exploitation of rights works differently to other content industries. When an author
grants a licence directly to the publisher for commercial exploitation of their work, this is
typically done on a worldwide exclusive basis, or at the very least on a pan-European basis.
Therefore, no further measures are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border
availability of books in the Single Market, in either physical or ebook format.



1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
 NO


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
 NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
Multi-territory licenses are often requested. For text, multi-territory licenses are issued
either by rightsholders or rightsholder-authorized Collective Management
Organizations (CMOs). Tens of thousands of licenses are issued annually in this manner.
Most multi-territory licences would comprise either the whole territory of the
EU/EEA/EFTA, the world or groups of countries that share a language (eg Belgium,
France, Luxembourg and Switzerland; UK and Republic of Ireland). STM supports
collective licensing mechanisms that are multi-territory, market-driven and quality
based that therefore do not lead to a “race to the bottom”, where CMOs with
overlapping territories compete purely on the basis of price. The Services Directive

(Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006) and non-exclusive mandates by
rightsholders (see answer below) are conducive to facilitating such mechanisms.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above –
what would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
For text, market based solutions offered either directly by rightsholders, or offered by
CMOs and licensing agents on a
(I) voluntary,
(II) non-exclusive,
(III) opt-in, and
(IV) market driven basis
work very well under the current legal regime.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
 NO


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
 NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
 NO – Please explain
Firstly, we believe that the Services Directive (Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December
2006 on services in the internal market) should continue to apply to copyright
management services.


Secondly, no further measures are necessary to increase cross-border availability. But to
ensure smooth functioning of the market, enforcement has to be enhanced. We believe,
therefore that service providers and platforms offering copyright-protected content, as
well as search engines and social media sites should play a greater role in raising

                                                                                            9
consumer awareness for the need for copyright compliance and should also more pro-
actively work with rightsholders to create a legally secure environment for rightsholder
licensing that facilitates smooth circulation of content legally made available and
sourced. Ultimately, a copyright compliant environment will enhance network services
of providers and content owners and lead to an increase in consumer choice, further
growth, innovation and development.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).

                                                                                                               10
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
 YES – For civil enforcement, STM and its members believe that the “scope” of the
making available right is sufficiently clear and that the “lex loci protectionis” conflict of
law rule for copyright provides adequate means to enforce copyright. In criminal
proceedings involving cybercrime and copyright infringement the competence of
enforcement agencies is not always clear. The Internal Market could benefit from
greater co-operation and co-ordination in criminal law matters.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief23)?
 NO – “Clarification” is not necessary. Introducing a country of origin principle would
have a detrimental effect, if introduced relating to the “making available” or any other
exclusive right of copyright. In our sector there are no particular practical problems
regarding the qualification of “authorship” within the EU and its member states in
relation to the “making available” right.
If the making available right were clarified and made subject to the country of origin
doctrine, it could be difficult to show that, say, a particular website is infringing
copyright in another country where the injunction is sought – but the damage is
nevertheless significant – i.e., that the site is using the intermediary’s service to infringe.
Thus rightholders could find their options and scope for action seriously limited.

2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
 NO – at least for text-based works, the two rights are mostly held and/or controlled by
the same rightsholder or the same agent of the rightsholder. Thus, very few, if any,
practical problems arise. Nevertheless, it remains useful to distinguish between the
rights, in particular where a user wishes first to acquire a licence for the reproduction
right only, and later wishes to add the faculty of “making available”. Thus, separate
exclusive rights reflect different user preferences and are conducive to scaled pricing
and customer segmentation, a positive feature of copyright.

3.       Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU24 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightsholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 25 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
 YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
Hyperlinks are essential tools for online content delivery and form part of the
communication process. Depending also on the actual facts, they should be subject to the
prior approval of a rightsholder, unless the rightsholder is entitled to set restrictions on
access to the materials. No further legislative action is needed in this area as the Court
jurisprudence continues to develop such as the judgment of 13 February 2014 by the
European Court of Justice in the matter of Nils Svensson et al vs Retriever Sverige AB
http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=147847&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first

Automated restrictions on access such as prohibitions on crawling must be followed by
search engines, or the search engines will be deemed infringers and/or contributory
infringers. More generally, STM is able to endorse the views and conclusions expressed

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
 NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an authorized act should not
require additional consent. However, it would be too simplistic to assume that all
“cache” memory copies are indeed “temporary” or strictly “incidental”. The facts of the
case need to be analysed and this is best left to courts. In this respect, there are
important cases pending before the court: C-435/12 ACI Adam BV and others (issue
and the impact of the legality of the source) where the opinion of Advocate General Cruz
Villalon is expected in the near future; case C-360/13 Meltwater (Public Relations
Consultants Association Ltd) re the issue of internet browsing and merely viewing
content on screen.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)26. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)27. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
 NO




26
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
27
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second -
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              13
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
The Copyright Directive does not foresee “digital exhaustion” for the reproduction and
making available rights (which are the rights implicated in digital licensing) and clearly
limits exhaustion to the distribution of physical copies by way of sale or other transfer of
ownership.
This is because digital reproductions are perfect clones of their original and cannot be
considered as a mere and degraded copy as normally understood in the physical world.
Furthermore “forward and delete” does not seem enforceable with today’s technology.
As recognised in this consultation, the ability to resell of previously purchased digital
content would have severe economic implications on the book sector.
Such an approach which introduces the concept of exhaustion to the right of distribution
when distribution takes place by transmission fails to recognise the inherent differences
in physical and digital products. Specifically, the nature of digital is such that quality
remains perfect over time, in contrast to physical goods where there is a degree of
deterioration over time. The second hand market for physical goods therefore has less of
an impact of the primary market, which can still function alongside a secondary market.
By contrast, with digital products the lack of deterioration in quality means that a
secondary market directly competes with the primary market and inevitably
undermines it. There would be no reason for any reader to pay for a new ebook if the
identical file was available second hand at a lower price.


If a rule on consumption for e-books was introduced it would mean that part of the 1st
sales would be transferred to the “used e-book market”. It is not unrealistic to consider
that due to the identity in products it could imply that up to 50 % or more of the sales
would be transferred to the “used market”. This would imply that the 1st sale would
have to be at a much higher price because fewer units have to secure the same incomes
allowing a reasonable return of investment to the author and publisher. Higher prices
would make it more relevant for the consumer to choose the “used” e-book instead of
the “original” e-book and it is hard to imagine how a negative spiral can be avoided. The
price setting for the original e-book will be almost impossible if consumption is allowed.


Further, it is impossible to determine whether a digital good has been sold; unlike a
physical sale where there is a transfer to another user and the denial of the continuing
use of the physical good by the seller, in the digital environment this is not the case –
both the seller and purchaser can continue to use the digital product. The implications
for widespread copyright infringement – and concurrent difficulties in enforcement –
are obvious.


Applying the principle of exhaustion to digital products would also stymie the
development of new business models.




                                                                                         14
License terms should therefore continue to be the norm in the area of text-based works,
such as books and journal articles. Both in the case of books and increasingly in the case
of journal articles, content is being sold at “below the book” and “below the article”
level, ie in chapters, extracts, original and non-original datasets. Users may purchase
access to works or receive copies of electronic works and other subject-matter under a
variety of conditions, including temporary access, streaming, discounted purchases,
including combined discounts for print copies and electronic access, subscription access
for a specified time period, special formats and normalised formats for further
automated use.
Regulation aimed at allowing resale will stifle innovation, especially at the lower cost
part of the market. For example, a consumer may prefer to buy a 99 Euro-cent copy of a
book with resale restrictions, rather than purchase a Euro 5.99 copy that allows resale.
These are matters of consumer preference and choice. Laws which forbid restrictions on
resale may lead to higher prices and fewer options for consumers, and will make
rightsholders more cautious about entering into new digital markets and experimenting
with new business models.
Alternatively, academic textbook publishers will have to “price-in” the anticipated re-
use thereby making the purchase of the initial copy unnecessarily more expensive. This
will in turn increase the risk of piracy and unauthorised uses, with a further detrimental
effect – a potentially vicious downward spiral.

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute28. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered29.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
 NO – A voluntary registration system that would “port” registrations obtained in one
EU Member State to another could be very useful (NB the effect of registration would
remain national, a similar to the “Madrid” trade mark registration system).
Rightsholders of text-based works would be able to select an EU Member State or the
EU as a whole as “country of first publication” and that country or the EU central
register would become the “base” registration country (again similar to “Madrid” treaty
and protocol).


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

28
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
29
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             15
[Open question]
Ownership information could be made searchable. Users and agents of users and
rightsholders would be able to identify potential licensors more easily. This could
contribute to a licensing environment that is fast, smart (part-automated), intuitive and
transparent. Particularly for the text-based sector, where licensing tends to be already
voluntary, non-exclusive, multi-territory and pro-competitive, potential advantages exist
further to lower transaction.


17.     What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Registration may place a heavy burden on creators and publishers, or become too
expensive if every title has to be registered and potentially registered manually, rather
than a registration per imprint or journal, or one tied to the DOI, ORCID, ISBN, ISTC
identification systems. A registration system could also be found to violate essential
rights under the Berne Convention, eg Article 5. A registration system should therefore
not be mandatory and will require benefits to encourage voluntary compliance to justify
the costs.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
Many advantages are imaginable. In Germany, for instance, already based on §53a of
the German Copyright Act, publishers who wish to reserve the right to authorise
document delivery by public libraries individually by offering reasonable licensing
terms (a kind of “opt-out” from an otherwise applicable statutory license administered
by VG Wort) must make their choice “obvious” to the users. In practice this
requirement is met by publishers notifying their offer of licenses on reasonable terms
through for instance the EZB, a database of library content resources that lists over
9,000 journals in this way. For more information on EZB, see (in English):
http://rzblx1.uni-
regensburg.de/ezeit/ppVabout.phtml?bibid=AAAAA&colors=7&lang=en&vid=&.

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 30, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database31 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The

30
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                       16
Linked Content Coalition32 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub33 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The EU should promote the development of an EU copyright hub and encourage the
adoption of appropriate standards. In doing so, the EU could usefully look at some
notable initiatives at national level (e.g. UK Copyright hub, a gateway to information
about copyright and ways to licence or get permission to use third party works, see
http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/).


The EU could fund voluntary registration systems adopted by rightsholders or jointly by
rightsholders and users such following the example of ARROW and ARROW+.

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention34 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
 YES – Please explain.

For the time being, STM does not see any need to increase the term of copyright
protection.

Conversely, the public domain or mandated unfunded open access in and of itself does
not lead to wider access or sustainable access and may also hinder the creation and

dissemination of valuable content by removing content type for which public domain or
an unreasonably short embargo is set from commerce. In practice, orphan works
legislation and voluntary, industry-led solutions for out-of-commerce works in the
publishing sector provide adequate mechanisms to allow access to older works that lack
a significant market or lack a steward or interested custodian, including by reason of
expiry of time or obsolescence (see STM “safe harbour” statements on orphan works
and out-of-commerce works, as well as a best practice statement on historical
collections, links to all three statements available through: http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_05_15_STM_Best_Practice_statement_on_Historical_Collections_and_ri
ghts_management.pdf).
Moreover, in the field of STM, publisher-agreed or negotiated embargo periods often
may substantially reduce the significance of term of protection for access for non-
commercial research or personal and private study uses.


 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC35.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law36. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 37, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional38, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")39.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
 NO – Please explain by referring to specific cases
One way to overcome ambiguities or discrepancies in exceptions and limitations is of
course to rely on the clarity of negotiated contracts and especially licensing agreements
that deal with the primary issues of concern on the part of the relevant stakeholders.
The variations in exceptions and limitations are not more confusing to users, especially
to users who wish to supply content cross-border than differing speed limits on
motorways, or other traffic rules of the road, or rules on fair standards in advertising
(all of which may differ not only between but sometimes within EU Member States). The
old maxim “when in Rome, do as the Romans do”, provides sensible motto to a
culturally diverse Europe and can actually in practice be followed by users who wish to
make content available.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
 NO – Please explain
Firstly, in STM’s view the EU member states are guardians of cultural diversity – one of
the EU’s greatest assets. With that diversity come different cultures, market traditions
and different stages of market saturation of available copyright-protected works. For
this reason, it would be wrong to force all EU Member States to introduce the same
exceptions with no opportunity for local adaptation. Secondly, an exception in a

39
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19
particular Member State may be adequate, while in another the same-worded exception
would create a conflict with the three-step test. This may arise due to different market
conditions. Thirdly, even if at EU level an exception may be verbatim agreed and made
mandatory, the interpretation of the wording of any such exception would still require
local courts to provide the contours of the exception, unless of course every case
involving an exception would be sent to the European Courts for guidance, but that may
be costly and introduce delays and problems of enforcement of rights of copyright in a
disproportionate manner.
Exceptions should also not be made “mandatory” by EU member states (although at the
moment this is possible and some member states have apparently done so). Limiting the
validity of willing-buyer, willing-seller contracts will decrease consumer choice and
interfere with cross-border trade where licensing agreements could provide balanced
solutions and a clearer definition of acts permitted under licence, irrespective of the
presence or absence of exceptions in a particular part of the EU.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
We believe that the current system is well balanced with an increasing number of
solutions being found between rightholders and users that are flexible and efficient. We
do not see the need to add new exceptions to the existing catalogue. Any new exceptions
should answer a market failure and the inability to serve users with practical
arrangements. We have seen no evidence of any such market failure The exercise of
“Licences for Europe”, within which STM and its membership actively participated,
illustrates that licences are powerful tools to cater for user demands. Licenses will find
an answer whenever access or other problems are made explicit. New exceptions set
prematurely would stifle business innovation and the ability of publishers to develop
new products and services with new markets and consumer needs in mind. Having said
this, STM also does not see a need to cull the list of non-mandatory exceptions at this
time.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
 NO – Please explain why
The EU regulatory framework is sufficiently flexible.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

Fair use requires litigation. In countries where it exists, there is a long common law
history interpreting the scope of fair use in a variety of specific circumstances.
Importing the concept to civil law countries would be particularly challenging, and
would require years of litigation to answer even the most fundamental questions about
its scope. It would add to the existing and already ample flexibility and result in
excessive uncertainty.
Fair use, even in the United States with decades of case law, is a concept that entails an
evaluation to potentially result in a case-specific exception from copyright infringement
tailor-made to the user’s use case. The downside of this approach is that legal certainty
and predictability for both users and rightsholders is sacrificed for the promise of
justice in individual cases – but “justice after the fact”, rather than legal certainty.
Moreover, we see that it is being advocated that “fair use” should be deployed to set
copyright policy and not to decide individual cases based on considerations of equity in a
particular case (“ius est ars boni et aequi” (Publius Celsus, 130 BC, cited in
Ulpian, D 1,1,1 pr). In STM’s view the concept of “fair use” shifts the decision from the
legislature to the judge and such a development is not one that STM believes is in the
interest of sound societal decision-making about copyright permitted acts in the EU. In
short, the concept of “fair use” would be truly a foreign transplant that the European
legal auto-immune system should reject.
National courts already take human rights into account when interpreting copyright law
and when balancing the interests of users with the rights and interests of copyright
holders. The flexibility thus practiced has stood the test of time.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
 NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
When offering a multi-territory license, variability of exceptions and limitations does not
play a role. What is important is that licensor and licensee have a common
understanding of what uses are going to be covered and what uses are not going to be
covered. Contractual definitions can thus help. Even where hypothetically the wording
of exceptions in different EU Member States were to be verbatim identical, what matters
are the practical expectations of parties to a contract. Thus, in practice differences and
uncertainty cannot be avoided by changing the territorial scope of exceptions or by re-
wording them, but by way of practical arrangements and clear delineation of what is
covered under a contract. EU or national law should facilitate rather than render such
delineation impossible in legally binding ways.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
The general principle by which the applicable law is that of the country where
protection is sought should apply until and unless full harmonization is achieved at EU
level.
However, to answer the hypothetical question above, the primary responsibility should
be on the user, but the entity/person providing the copy should also be liable, a kind of

                                                                                         21
“subsidiary joint and several liability”, as opposed to a liability for secondary
infringement (contributory infringement) only. In this way, the provider would have a
clear incentive to arrange its affairs in such a way that would lead to fair compensation
being actually paid to the rightsholder.

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving40 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions41. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive42.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.      Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
N/A


(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
 NO

In the digital and online world preservation as well as access problems are best solved
through public-private partnership, rather than through unilateral consumer rights or
exceptions.

This is demonstrated for instance by market-based solutions such as PORTICO and
CLOCCKS which have provided enormously efficient ways to archive and protect
scientific content, particularly also electronic content. For more information on these
joint publisher-librarian projects, see: http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/ To
date more than 300 million files have been preserved in this way by Portico. For more
information on CLOCKS, see http://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home.


The two private-public partnership projects illustrate that, in the digital and online
world, exceptions in and of themselves achieve little if there is no enabling framework –
a point publishers also have repeatedly made as part of “Licences for Europe” in the
context of Text and Data Mining for non-commercial research purposes, and also in the
context of the 2011 MoU for out-of-commerce works. The same point STM and other
publishers also made in relation to access for visually impaired persons in the run up to
the Marrakesh Treaty facilitating access for the blind and print disabled.


Returning to the issue of cultural conservation preservation of science records long-
term, exceptions alone would not have accomplished such comprehensive preservation
as is being undertaken through PORTICO and CLOCKSS, as such preservation is
logistically and technically as well as socially and culturally challenging.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
None needed.

31.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
None needed. For non-orphaned works, rightsholders should be consulted and must
consent to copies being made. In this way, market incentives will find new ways of
making content useful and accessible. This has proven enormously successful in science
publishing, where the digital migration has revolutionized the way content is distributed
and used, with positive effects for scientific advancement. Where no markets are viable
either for good or for the time being, public-private partnerships are the way forward,
as these can adapt to dynamic changes, changes that are far more rapid in the digital
age.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
                                                                                        23
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.


32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
N/A


(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
N/A


(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
Remote access is a standard component of many licenses issued by our members. It is
often cross-border. Remote access is negotiated in such licenses and can affect pricing
and other terms.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
 Any so-called “problems” can be solved by market-based solutions. Rightsholders and
their representatives can issue cross-border licenses.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
Legislation is not needed. It would likely stifle innovation in business models.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
N/A


(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
N/A


(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
 YES – 36c (Rightsholder) Please explain with specific examples
Traditionally, library lending was primarily lending physical books to local registered
patrons and in addition some Inter Library Loan (ILL). E-lending to local registered
patrons of academic libraries is something that STM publishers have no problem with:
Our members have negotiated cross-border e-lending agreements with individual
libraries, library consortia (national, regional or local), and with Collective Management
Organizations for limited forms of document delivery that in the parlance of the study,
could be described also as “e-lending”, but really is a form of document supply on
request. In addition STM has endorsed three framework agreements with leading
libraries/library consortia in Europe: A framework agreement with the British Library
for non-commercial document delivery abroad (into EU countries and internationally);
a framework agreement with the CNRS-INIST of France that permits domestic and
international document supply for paper, and for electronic versions of journal articles.
Two framework agreements (one international and one regional for German-speaking
countries Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, “GALS”,) with the German
library consortium “Subito”. In all three cases, non-commercial supply of individual
journal articles on request is permissible to researchers, students and academics on
preferential terms and for reduced copy fees, while preserving the market for
commercial supply of journal articles at publisher-set rates. Publishers, in turn, have a
choice of entering into these framework agreements or to be represented by CMOs or
agents non-exclusively.



                                                                                             25
Beyond STM, it is clear that publishers are taking steps to experiment with supply
models and that there is scope for trialling. The key though is for publishers to retain
control of how their works are lent and for them to have the freedom to experiment with
the models that are best suited to their own individual businesses. One size will not fit
all.

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
Any problems would be solved by ensuring rightsholders continue to be able to reach
agreements, including across borders, and by ensuring that local laws are followed by
the libraries.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
While we support licensed e-lending, because of the ease of digital copying, lending
should only be done pursuant to license.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
The supply of documents on demand and at a distance (ie not for pick-up in the library)
is in essence a distribution function and puts libraries in a some competitive context with
publishers and distributors that is absent in the traditional role of the library concerned
with collection curation and local access. STM’s members have long developed licensing
solutions that address these new features in bespoke licensing arrangements, consortia
licensing arrangements and national access licensing arrangements.
Where electronic resources are concerned, licensing terms and negotiations usually
provide for adequate ways of resolving the vision, strategy and operational needs of
libraries as key purchasers of STM content. Where libraries, however, use their print
and offline collection to convert same into digital format (scanning or OCR), the
potential for a conflict and unfair competition exists, where libraries acquired a resource
that was intended going to be used within the contemplation of the parties for the benefit
of on-site patrons and not at a distance or in competition with other licensees of the
publisher, such as licensed commercial document delivery services.
A further example is that STM has facilitated sample or model agreements or
framework agreements on document delivery with the major libraries active in this area
(See also answer to Question 36.c)). The result is that some form of non-commercial
document delivery on request is licensed at discounted preferential rates where scanned
materials from the permanent collection of a library are used and where not more than
a designated (single digit) number of copies from a journal annual volume are delivered

                                                                                             26
electronically on request, either direct to a pre-defined universe of non-commercial or
academic end-users or as part of inter-library loan (again for a non-commercial final
recipient). The quid pro quo for participating libraries and consortia of libraries is that
they agree on a process that is designed to minimise the abuse of this preferential access
beyond the intended classes of persons (academics, researchers, students, certain social
services or government departments as may be agreed).

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other43. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)44.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
 NO
We do not believe that changing national law is necessary or even useful to account for
the crossborder access. STM has been intimately involved in the negotiation of the MoU
and provides this background:
The MoU of 2011 importantly does not only involve national libraries and collective
management organisations, but was negotiated with authors and publishers. It is in fact
the authors and publishers who must work out any mass-digitisation project with
interested libraries and as is stated clearly in the MoU. The collective management


43
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
44
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             27
organisations importantly then facilitate implementation of whatever underlying
principles have been agreed locally.
Further to incentivise and to enable these projects, STM and signatory members have
gone out of their way unilaterally to declare a safe harbour for those libraries and users
who undertake to abide by the MoU. Thus,from the perspective of making out-of-
commerce STM materials accessible, no legislative back-up or limitation of rights of
action is necessary. To facilitate cross-border availability of out-of-commerce works, it
may in some countries be desirable to make provision for a safe harbour where libraries
and collective management organisations implement a digitisation project pursuant to
the MoU principles.
It is important to recognise that, unlike orphan works, out-of-commerce works are not a
homogenous class of works or their status of being out-of-commerce is due to a
multitude of factors, cultural, social, historical (regarding historical collections, see also
STM’s          best         practice          statement         at:         http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_05_15_STM_Best_Practice_statement_on_Historical_Collections_and_ri
ghts_management.pdf). Thus, a one-size-fits all solution is not easily possible and any
solution requires a balanced approach, particularly where cross-border access is
concerned. For this reason STM wishes to emphasise the feature in the 2011 MoU that
mandates an “opt-in” system for out-of-commerce works that are either used very
intensively or frequently. This is a flexible test that is designed to provide a yardstick
that allows a rightsholder whose works are used intensively (eg in advertising of a
tendentious nature, display in snippets out-of-context or next to other works not
approved by the rightsholder), or frequently (an out-of-commerce work suddenly has
enormous market appeal that was unexpected), to bring the work in question back to
life with new authorised editions. The other effect of this balancing criterion is also that
the fair compensation can be kept relatively low for out-of–commerce works that are not
used intensively or frequently.
However, if all the conditions set in the MoU are followed, we do not believe that any
legislation is needed at European level.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
 NO OPINION

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC45 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

                                                                                               28
42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
N/A
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
In STM’s view it is important that the national exceptions provide for carve-out for
works whose primary market is, in fact, teaching. This has been done in some member
states, such as Spain, France, Germany (up to a point) and Hungary. Where no carve-
out exists, there exists the potential that an exception is applied in contravention of the
Berne Convention three-step test. Essentially, works may be used for illustration that
are not principally made for teaching, eg novels. However, it would be wrong to try and
use the exception to by-pass the vibrant educational materials market, ie to avoid
purchasing text books and materials purpose-made for teaching under this exception.
Member States as funders of state education and educationists faced with tight
education budget constraints do not always make this distinction and a clarification in
this regard, or a carve-out at EU level could be useful.

43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
See answer to question No. 42 above.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Our members frequently authorize use of content for teaching purposes as part of
voluntary market-based licenses with educational institutions. These are successful
licenses which result from negotiations.


STM also has issued Guidelines for Academic Re-use which provide academic users and
researchers a sign-post as to how third-party content of an STM nature can be used in
keeping with scientific best practice and without causing market harm or distorting
academic findings or concepts of ethics in referencing third party works.


45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
Legislative solutions are not required, and in fact may limit new business models and
consumer choice.


                                                                                           29

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
N/A


(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain
While the scientific collaboration and communication models are among the fastest
evolving, the need for scholarly communication remains a constant for more than 300
years, being intimately linked to the age of enlightenment and discovery.
STM publishers use very flexible licensing terms that accommodate researchers that
work by correspondence or in small team across institutions, across countries and across
oceans. The average STM article has just under five co-authors and those typically
emanate from more than one country. These issues are normally successfully addressed
by publishing contracts, copyright transfer forms and rightsholder agreements.
Licensing of research institutions, research-intensive companies and sectors as well as
public-private partnerships can be licensed directly for their access and copy needs or
through Collective Management Organizations.


Apart from institutional licensing models, alternative access models, by way of pay-per-
view, deep dyve rental models (30 day to 1-year rentals for online viewing, see
http://www.deepdyve.com/), document delivery models are supplementing access for
persons unaffiliated with a research institution or requiring only topical or occasional
access.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC47 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 48.

The Marrakesh Treaty49 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of

STM understands that exceptions and limitations in favour of the visually impaired are
necessary and to the extent that they remain carefully crafted and proportionate are
justified by the public interest.
STM believes that what matters is not widening or increasing the number of exceptions,
but make sure that the system provides for incentives for publishers and ebook platform
owners, as well as intermediary software makers to work together to develop a
mainstream concept of access. In addition, accessibility is not only confined to the actual
content but to the discovery of that content.
STM also believes that even in likely future scenario of near 100% access (already today
more than 75% of the top 1,000 UK titles are fully accessible for VIPs), the provision of
specialised books and braille materials will remain important to those VIP readers who
have never had eye sight or lost their eye sight before being able to become literate and
numerate and form a visual concept of syntax. For such readers, for their personal
development, ebooks that are “read-aloud” enabled and screen-aids will remain
insufficient to acquire necessary life skills.
STM fully participates in WIPO’s TIGAR and has also contributed and continues to
take part in ETIN initiatives to facilitate crossborder access to accessible versions and
files.


51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
STM has collaborated with IPA and others in formulating accessibility guidelines that
allow the mainstreaming of born-accessible text-based works and other subject-matter.
STM continues to participate in TIGAR, a WIPO-sponsored group that brings relevant
stakeholders together. More generally, STM members co-operate with technology
companies and facilitators that even where exceptions are available to retro-digitise
works, prefer to obtain publisher-grade original master copies o books and other text-
based materials. One initiative that works on a licensing model for international delivery
is the California-based organisation Bookshare. Many STM members, including the
largest have licensing and electronic file supply agreements with this organisation
(https://www.bookshare.org/).


Specifically, regarding cross-border access and access for VIPs resident in the
developing world, it remains STM’s contention that it should be the technology that
travels cross-border, not the content. Demand for content, apart from global best-sellers
remains essentially local for text-based works and it is really the technology of making a
digital work accessible to VIPs that should be allowed to travel rather than providing
access to books that are of interest to audiences, say in Canada, to audiences in, say,
Usbekistan, who really are better understood by local publishers in terms of their actual
market demands.


52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]


                                                                                          32
Very successful – a fact that is even admitted by RNIB in its video about the merits of
ebooks available on YouTube at: “Ebooks have done amazing things in the last couple of
years for blind and partially sighted people in terms of sheer amount of titles that are
available […]” at 2 minutes 51 seconds of the video below:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16krEX-4UJ4&feature=c4-overview-
vl&list=PLCE83CC9BE830400E.
Exceptions and other government regulations must not stifle market solutions. For
segments that due to economic and other social reasons will remain underserved and to
convert legacy content into accessible formats, public-private partnerships are needed to
create an environment that guides VIP readers to the easiest and most convenient point
of access, be it commercial, non-commercial or assisted.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 50 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”51. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that

 NO – Please explain
STM has fully participated in working group four of “Licences for Europe”. STM’s
members have pledged to assist researchers and to facilitate and meet bona fide non-
commercial text and data mining requests, see “Declaration” by signatory STM
publishers (a growing but already very impressive list), which has become part of the
“Pledges”     of   the    Licences    for   Europe”       process:    http://www.stm-
assoc.org/2013_11_11_Text_and_Data_Mining_Declaration.pdf


Text and data mining has implications to our members’ websites and business models.
Crawling websites for text and data can adversely impact upon the security and
technical performance of the website. Reuse of content in the name of “text and data”
mining can harm rightsholders in a number of ways, including in enabling the creation
of unauthorized derivative works. Likewise, it is not always possible to distinguish
between a legitimate researcher and an entity who wishes to scan or copy content for
piratical purposes. For these reasons, direct voluntary licensing approaches are the most
appropriate mechanisms for TDM requests.


STM members are providing licenses or permissions to facilitate both legitimate non-
commercial private research activities and commercial research projects. These will be
turning into mainstream services during the coming years:
(I) CrossRef's latest collaborative service, Prospect <https://prospect.crossref.org/> ,
emerges from its 2013 pilot and plans its full launch, it is worth reviewing other recent
events and initiatives, and where the STM publishing industry stands in terms of
delivering text and data mining (TDM) services to its customers.
The Prospect service builds on the existing CrossRef infrastructure to provide a
common, standards-based cross-publisher API and licence registry. The publisher adds
two new links to each article's record in the CrossRef database: first, a link to a version
of the text designated for mining; and second, to the relevant text mining licence (which
could be an existing institutional licence, or could be a click-through licence).
Researchers will be able to select publishers of interest, accept their licence terms and
                                                                                          34
conditions, and then receive a unique Client API Token. This key acts as an identifier to
validate requests and make content available. Prospect also allows publishers optionally
to manage the load on their platforms by specifying rate-limiting.
Prospect will be free for researchers, with costs met by charges to participating
publishers (similar to other CrossRef services such as CrossCheck). There are no plans
for publisher charges until 2015.
(II)       A        recent       NISO           draft      recommended           practice
<http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/> on Open Access Metadata and Indicators
addresses a similar issue to Prospect's licence information links in much the same way,
with a <license_ref> tag pointing to licence terms specifying reuse rights (of which text
mining could be one subset).
(III) PLS Clear <http://www.plsclear.com/> , a new service from the Publishers
Licensing Society, is due to launch in early 2014. It will be a digital clearinghouse
allowing researchers to gain request TDM rights from multiple publishers through a
single online form.
(IV) Another, perhaps more ambitious, initiative is the pilot being led by Copyright
Clearance Center. CCC sees the difficulties end-users and publishers face in negotiating
multiple bilateral licences as a classic case for a collective licensing solution, but
recognises that collective licensing only provides part of the solution. The pilot is
therefore exploring the development of a platform that would not just licence but would
also provide access to a repository of XML content. The CCC solution would also not
just allow users to mine existing subscribed (and open) content, but also - and
importantly - it supports mining of unsubscribed content. Users can search across both
simultaneously, returning metadata for unsubscribed content with the option to
purchase.

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Solutions need to combine technology and content: without technology, content is lame,
while technology without content is blind (adapting Einstein’s statement about religion
and science: "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." This
implies that solutions must necessarily be Mutti-stakeholder, something exceptions
(advocated as a potential solution by some) cannot really accomplish.
Apart from defining a commonly shared goal of what text and data mining can
accomplish and how it is best accomplished, all stakeholders should work together to
maximise the chance of successful text and data mining.
In STM’s view an exception for text and data mining undertaken even just for purposes
that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial will hinder, rather than further, the
development of a collaborative environment for successful text and data mining.


Our members, in collaboration with the user communities, are developing a number of
market-based solutions to enable lawful text and data mining. Legislation is likely to
adversely impact upon market developments by discouraging innovation by companies
who do not wish to invest in technologies that may be made redundant by legislation,



                                                                                      35
and paradoxically, legislation is not likely to solve the largely technological barriers to
text and data mining.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
There is no need for legislation, which is likely to be counterproductive and will likely
inure to the benefit of large US search providers at the expense of European creators
and users.
TDM as a licensing proposition has demonstrated the right way of having clear and
specific usage rights that everyone can understand.

56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Market based solutions are best. Useful and successful text and data mining will more
likely result from collaboration among parties who can evaluate needs, risks, costs and
benefits. Our members are already engaged in these discussions with users, and users
are already mining our members’ content under license. (See also answer to question No.
53 c)).


57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?
[Open question]
Technological and security issues are more significant than copyright issues.
Text and data mining has implications to our members’ websites and business models.
Crawling websites for text and data can adversely impact upon the security and
technical performance of the website. Uncontrolled access requests and crawling can
cause server instability and overload. In this way legitimate services may be jeopardised
and service degradation could ensue to the detriment of all other customers. Access
requests that are not standardised and not coming from known parties could point to
system interference or even espionage. Access for reading can be likened to drinking
water from a tap (small quantity, reading grade), while access for TDM is more like a
watering the garden with a hose (large quantity downloads, different machine-readable
mark-up). To publishers, it is obvious that different purposes of access require the
following of different protocols.

F.     User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and



                                                                                           36
blogs52. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions53.

when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on

N/A


(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?
 YES – Please explain by giving examples
Even “non-commercial” UGC often harms creators’ rights, competes with legitimate
sales, and is offered on sites with advertising and/or profit motives. We are not opposed
to incorporation of existing works in new works on reasonable basis, and science
publishing has a long tradition of allowing this, with community-developed ethical rules

52
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

governing issues such as credit. However, exceptions or statutory licenses must be
avoided or, at most, narrowly drawn for works clearly destined at private consumption
(eg combination of power-point slides with a musical composition that is not used
intensively or frequently – a criterion drawn from the 2011 MoU on out-of-commerce
text-based works. The reality of evolving UGCs is very complex and includes many
different phenomena, so that a one size fits all solution is impossible.

(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide possibilities for users that
are publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service to properly identify these works for online use?
 YES – Please explain
STM Publishers act as rightsholders and service providers relating to their own
platforms. Identifying authors and content is key to avoid plagiarism. Science publishing
has customs and practices around reuse which are not always abided in an online
environment. Publishers invest in plagiarism detection software and in tools that
facilitate academic honesty.


60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
N/A


(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?
 YES – Please explain
Our members’ rights are often infringed. Litigation is an expensive route and frequently
the only available route. When it comes to re-publication of pre-existing materials, STM
offers 2012 Permission Guidelines available from STM’s website with an FAQ to explain
some of the context. Where uses go beyond those permitted, licensing is available
through RightsLink a transactional rights clearance engine facilitated by the Copyright
Clearance Center. There are also localised permission services, such as MvB in
Germany that address similar rights clearance needs.)

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying54. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5556.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions57 in the digital environment?

There is no need since the Copyright Directive put already in place the basic principles
and notions to be applied to the private copying and reprography exceptions and
limitations.
Moreover the non-mandatory character of such exceptions and limitations has provided
Member States with enough flexibility to adapt their legal national systems within the
limits of the legality imposed by the EU framework. The European Court of Justice
plays a decisive role in the interpretation and application of these exceptions.
Levies remain important in the digital environment, particularly on storage devices
(equipment levies). The small risk of “double payments” does not outweigh the larger
risk of “no payments” to creators and publishers. Moreover, to the extent fees are paid
by different entities receiving different benefits from the creative work (eg, hardware
manufacturers and users), we do not see this as double-payment unless the specific fee
was paid twice on behalf of the same user/use.
Levies are never the preferred option to compensate rightsholders, but the last resort,
where a work has found its way to the end-user market and the end-user is likely to
make additional lawful uses that remain in the private sphere of the end-user. Levies
must be designed so that they do not prevent or interfere with the definition of
contractual relations between rightsholders and end-users and levies are also not meant
to compensate for piracy.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 58
 YES – Please explain
Premised on the statement that the harm is “minimal”, the answer to this question must
be that no levy should be owing. However, STM would exhort caution in the assumption
that rightsholder harm is “minimal”: What is worth copying, is worth protecting, it was
said in an English copyright case and unless the private copying activity in question is
fully taken into account and part of the STM member’s customer licence, STM sees no
reason that compensation should be waived.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Cloud computing services or other services permitting digital access of protected works
should not be covered by the exception, but be squarely subject to licensing.
Moreover, the exception is reserved to the private individual sphere and should not be
object of commercial activities of third parties, as it would be the case if levies are
applied storage in the cloud.
Cloud-based services are fast developing and STM’s members provide content to many
customers who make use of cloud services. From the point of view of devising a levy
58
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          40
scheme, great care must be taken not to give the impression of a so-called “culture flat
rate”, which would only inadequately incentives the creation of quality content. A cloud-
based service will present many challenges to a levy scheme, as fewer permanent copies
are likely being made by consumers and their family circle and also the storage device
will usually be a server farm that could be based anywhere on the planet.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?59
 YES – Please explain
Levies paid on equipment purchased by professional (business) organisations should be
refunded on request as is for instance possible in Austria. Business organisations cannot
benefit from a private copy exception and their internal copying must be compensated
by way of a corporate voluntary licence and not by way of a levy. By the same token,
there is no reason why such organisations should pay a levy when the equipment is used
exclusively for professional or business purposes.
Any visibility of levies should not mislead consumers into believing that they have
acquired a right to reproduce and freely distribute content beyond the strict limits of the
exception.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments60.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
 NO – Please explain

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
See answer to question No. 67.


70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers61 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract62. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
Competition among publishers ensures fair remuneration for creators. Publishers
compete with each other for publication rights from authors, editors and learned
societies. If remuneration is insufficient, creators can find other outlets.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
 NO – Please explain why
Competition and market based solutions are the best way to ensure fair remuneration.

     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE63 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text64. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose65. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure66. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
 YES – Please explain
ISPs have the means to filter infringing content but choose not to do so. ISPs must
promptly remove infringing content. If the same content is subject of multiple notices,
the ISPs should filter against reposting: “Notice and Take-Down” should in such case
become an automated Take Down without Notice and, in any case, a “Notice and Stay-
Down”.
Copyright enforcement against infringements carried out for a commercial purpose
must be made more efficient.
More generally, the Enforcement Directive needs to extend the presumption of
ownership to holders of exclusive licenses or to assignees of copyright owners, as the
findings of the staff working paper also point out. Publishers do not benefit from a
“related right”, in the same way producers of sound recordings or films do as holders to
the “related right”, which results in publishers potentially lacking “locus standi”.
However, structurally, it is rarely the author but mostly the publisher that will have the


63
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
64
   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
65
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
66
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           43
resources to take legal action but frequently time and resources are wasted in proving
ownership, while the defendant has absolutely no basis to contest it.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
Intermediaries and advertisers (these latter do have some incentives and a number of
initiatives are ongoing at national level) have little incentive to cooperate on
infringements. Advertisers and intermediaries should be required to take reasonable
measures to prevent infringements.
As seen above it is recognised and confirmed in the EU legal regime that Intermediaries
are the best placed to bring an end to copyright infringements. This is true not only for
online services providers but also for ad brokers, ad networks, payment providers and
ultimately search engines. A French court (Allowstreaming case) has recently ruled that
litigation against certain ISPs, like hosting providers can at times be futile, given the fact
that they can easily relocate. Instead other intermediaries could be ordered to act, such
as access providers and search engines. Intermediaries should also be subject to the
know-your-consumer rules similarly to banks, lawyers casinos and other regulated
professions. Cooperation and more proactive measures should be further encouraged
together with voluntary measures and self-regulation. At the same time it should be
made sure that financial sources and revenues stemming from illicit activities are cut
back by a strict and consistent follow-the-money approach (advertising revenues via ad
brokers and networks, payment providers, etc).

77.    Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
 NO – Please explain
The balance tilts too much towards infringement and allows ISPs and advertisers to
make money on harm caused to creators.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


                                                                                           44
 NO


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
STM believes that the Commission should in the short and medium term prioritise work
on the enforcement of existing rules, the facilitation of pragmatic dialogues and the
promotion of voluntary solutions such as the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on
Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works
signed by all stakeholders concerned. In STM’s view conceptualising a European title of
copyright is a distinct long-term potential project. Before embarking on such a project,
which could take more than a decade to devise, the Commission could study the subject
in terms of vision, purpose, benefits and costs, and also in terms of managing how an EU
title would be phased-in and EU member states titles would be either maintained
alongside an EU title or phased-out or converted.
It is conceivable, for instance, that an EU title in the far future could be placed at the
disposal and at the sole discretion and election of the author or first copyright owner in
relation to any new work created after a certain date. A rightsholder would thus
effectively “opt-out” of EU national titles in favour of a unique European-wide
copyright. The EU would have to decide whether the EU title would only be effective
among the 28 EU countries and whether for international trading partners (US, China,
Brazil, Russia) the copyright would remain that of the EU member state of origin
(determined under the Berne Convention), or if the EU title would replace the national
member state title even at international level – not an easy feat. Rightsholders and the
market would thus have the ability to decide for themselves if they prefer an EU title to
EU member state solutions.
