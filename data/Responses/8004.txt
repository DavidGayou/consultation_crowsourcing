British Musicians' Union response to the Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules
                                       
The British Musicians' Union (BMU) welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation on behalf of our 30,500 professional musician members. We would also like to support the submissions made by UK Music, AEPO-ARTIS, the International Federation of Musicians (FIM) and the Alliance of Artists, Managers and Performers (AMP). We only responded to questions that have a direct impact on our members. We do not wish our response to remain anonymous.

Question 8 - Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear?

We do not believe that the scope is sufficiently clear in cross-border situations, but it is also not clear in situations occurring inside an individual Member State. On this question we would like to support and endorse the arguments made by AEPO-ARTIS.

Question 9 - Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief )?

Yes, this could affect performers' rights. For example in Spain, performers are entitled to a payment of equitable remuneration whenever their works are made available on demand. If a work was made available on demand in e.g. Greece, and the country of origin approach was taken, a Spanish performer may find that he/she received no equitable remuneration for the making available on demand of their performance.


Question 10 - Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

No, it is not a problem in itself as long as both rights are fully respected. A single licence between the service provider and the collective management organisation representing performers should cover all relevant issues.

Question 20 - Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

Yes, we believe that they are. The adoption of Directive 2011/77/EU on the extension of the term of protection was an important step towards a better recognition of the value of performing artists' work and creativity. 

The term extension regarding performers and phonograms effectively reduces the gap between the existing protection for the work of authors, which lasts until 70 years after their lifetime. Performers, whose protection was previously limited to an overall period of 50 years, now enjoy a period of 70 years. This will, in most cases, ensure that performers do not see some of their own performances fall into the public domain while they are still alive and relying on revenues from IP rights. 
This extension of the term of protection for performers should not, however, be limited to their sound recordings  -  it should also cover their audiovisual recordings. The Commission should therefore comply with its obligation as laid out in article 3(2) of the 2011 Directive and assess the need for extending the Directive to audiovisual performances without further delay, in order to ensure the smooth transposition into the Aquis of the Beijing Treaty..

Question 22 - Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

We believe that there is the need for a higher level of harmonisation across Europe to reflect best practise in the interests of authors and performers. For example, the UK Government's treatment of the private copying exception and its proposals to introduce such an exception without fair compensation for rights-holders flouts European Law and should not be allowed. Performers' rights must be protected across Europe.

Question 27 - In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Some Member States have a private copying exception whilst others do not. When a reproduction is made by a consumer in a Member State with a private copying exception, private copying remuneration is payable. If that reproduction was deemed to occur only in a single Member State where no such exception exists (e.g. the country of origin) no private copying remuneration would be payable (although the reproduction would infringe the performers' reproduction right).

Furthermore, Member States differ in their national laws and practices regarding, for example, transfer of rights. This could have the effect of discouraging service providers from establishing businesses in a Member State which has a responsible and fair approach to the protection of artists. It would benefit Member States that adopt a relaxed approach to copyright protection which in the long run would be damaging to the creative industry and thus the economy of the EU as a whole.

If there were a higher level of harmonisation of exceptions across Europe, then this would not be a problem. At the moment, the issue is that a French artist, for example, can find themselves disadvantaged by the fact that there is no private copying exception in the UK.

Question 64 - In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?


We do not see the need for clarification, as the private copying exception contained in article 5(2) 2001/29/EC Directive applies to the digital environment without any need to adjust its scope or application. 

The ECJ has provided important guidance (e.g. Opus, Padawan, Austro Mechana, VG Wort cases) addressing a number of elements regarding professional uses, reimbursement systems and funds supporting cultural and social activities. On a number of other aspects the Court's decision is still pending (e.g. in the Copydan case).

These ECJ decisions have contributed to a coherent system of private copying remuneration by providing answers to the most important issues that were raised and have confirmed the validity of the system in today's environment. The need for this exception in the digital environment should not, therefore, be questioned. On the contrary, the growing ease with which individuals can make private copies of copyright protected content means that more and more copies are being made. The exception provides the freedom for consumers to make private copies and crucially also a guarantee of compensation for rightsholders. Private copying levies remain an effective mechanism to compensate rightsholders for acts of private copying. 

The BMU is therefore of the view that a radical overhaul, such as that which occurred in Spain, or an adoption of some of Mr Vitorino's recommendations is neither justified nor required. Such proposals would financially disadvantage performers, who see remuneration for private copying as an important source of income. It amounts to almost one third of all revenues collected on their behalf by collective management organisations. 

We do agree, however, that greater harmonisation across Europe would be helpful as long as it implemented best practice in terms of compensation for performers.

Question 65 - Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licensed by rightsholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

Yes, we believe that they should. As stated in the response to question 64, private copying regimes remain absolutely relevant in the digital age.

As AEPO-ARTIS states, the approach proposed by Mr Vitorino on the issue of licensing of private copies vis-à-vis digital services is legally invalid. The Court of Justice of the EU countered the recommendation of Mr Vitorino in the VG Wort case (C-457/11). The decision of the court does not only provide that any act `authorising' a private reproduction has no legal effect, it also states that any such purported `authorisation' would have no bearing on fair compensation owed.

Article 5(2) of the 2001/29/EC Directive should apply vis-à-vis digital copies and cloud services considering that the download itself would fall under the licensing agreement and any subsequent copies made from the downloaded copy should be subject to the payment of private copying remuneration. 

The payment of fair compensation to rightsholders is an essential requirement for the legitimacy of the implementation of private copying exceptions in national law. This was recently acknowledged by the EU Court of Justice in the Padawan case (Case C 467/08). 

Question 66 - How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing  allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightsholders' revenue on the other?

We believe that the principles of the private copying exception contained in article 5(2) of Directive 2001/29/EC, are fully compatible and should be applicable to online services such as certain cloud computing services. No legislative changes are therefore needed in order for the exception and accordingly the payment of compensation to be applicable to such services that facilitate acts of private copying. It is merely a question of adapting administrative practices in the collection of compensation for these services. 

A recent study by Compass Lexecon showed that the level of copyright remuneration has a strong influence on content creation, but no real impact on  -  and therefore does not hinder  -  the state of development of the digital market. 

The payment of fees in order to respect copyright and related rights must form part of the start-up plan and costs for any new business. There is no reason why these fees should be ignored whilst the costs of manufacture and employees are taken into account from the start.

Nor is it the case that consumers benefit from the abolition of private copy levies. A recent study confirmed that the phasing out of private copying levies by the Spanish government decree from 31 December 2011 had no effect on the prices of devices. There has been no decrease in the price of devices and thus the abolition of private copying levies has had no positive effect on consumers. 

Question 67  -  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies.

No, we firmly believe that levies should be paid by the hardware manufacturers in much the same way that they already pay for software licences and for patents.It would be wrong for the levy costs to be bourne by consumers, therefore an explicit mention of them on invoices would be unnecessary. 

Question 71 - If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

Given the situation in the UK the BMU does not have the benefit of any direct interaction with a domestic levy system. Levies, as with all uses licensed by and income distributed by CMOs, should be subject to the highest standards of transparency and accountability to both users and rights-holders. 

Question 72 - What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

There are many ways to deliver adequate remuneration, but the digital age means that new ways should be found to remunerate authors and performers. A perfect example of `inadequate' remuneration is the way in which streaming has been interpreted as a `physical sale' by record labels. In fact, streaming is simply a modern form of broadcast, and so remuneration should take place on that basis  -  which would mean a 50/50 split with the artist/s. 

Question 73 - Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?

The BMU believes that outdated and indefensible clauses should be outlawed from recording contracts and that all clauses in music industry contracts should be clear, transparent and accountable.
Record companies rely upon, and continue to include, clauses in their contracts with artists that have no place in a digital environment. These include clauses that, harking back to an analogue era, reduce the royalties payable on a download. These clauses bear no relation to digital sales. The following is an example of these unfair clauses:

Packaging Deductions were introduced in the late 1950's to share the costs between artist and label for any packing beyond a simple paper record sleeve. i.e. If an artist wanted a gold embossed gatefold album sleeve ( or even a simple photo) then the label took 25% from the Royalty rate ( regardless of cost). Packaging Deductions were later appropriated by the Labels as a way to share the burden of the cost of the industry moving format from vinyl to CD. Packaging deductions, sometimes referred to as `new technology discounts', are still widely applied to digital formats where there is no packaging.

Breakages: A flat reduced royalty rate was applied by labels to artist's share to cover the `eventuality' of broken vinyl. i.e. If a box of fragile vinyl LP's was dropped in a shop, the artist was charged for the (possible) mishap even if no records were damaged. This deduction was carried forward through the CD era and is still widely applied to the artist share for digital formats where breakages are not possible.

Distribution: A flat deduction from the artist Royalty Rate was applied contractually to share the costs of transport of Records/CDs to and from retailers. Such deductions are also widely applied to Digital formats, where a Wav file is sent directly from the Mastering Engineers to the Label, via the web, and is then uploaded to i-Tunes or any other digital aggregator, and often directly from the Mastering Service to the seller's site.

In addition, we commend to the Commission the 2002 amendment to German copyright law, aimed at strengthening the contractual position of performers. An important aspect of this is the ability for a performer to ask the producer to renegotiate the contract. This amendment was well-intentioned but has had little practical effect to-date. Therefore the Commission should consider enhancing it and extending it to other EU members states as part of a comprehensive harmonisation process.

We further believe that assignment should never be for the duration of the copyright. The MU would be happy for assignment or licensing to happen, but we believe that it should only ever be for a limited time, for example 20 or 30 years, and should then be able to be renewed. In order to provide business certainty to record labels, exclusivity should also be granted, but only for the duration of the assignment or license. 

Question 74 - If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

The situation of performers in the audiovisual field is currently unacceptable. 
In particular, the European legislator has continued to exclude performers in the audiovisual field from benefiting from any right for the broadcasting and communication to the public of their recordings. There is no justification for such a right only being enjoyed by performers in the audio field.

Furthermore, the extension of the term of protection granted to performers should not be limited to their sound recordings but should also cover their audiovisual fixations.
The Commission should therefore comply with its obligation as laid down in article 3(2) of the 2011 Directive and assess the need for extending the Directive to audiovisual performances without any further delay.  

In addition to the lack of audiovisual rights, we believe that the Commission should engage in an in-depth examination of the operation of the Making Available Right with the intention of ensuring that performers are justly rewarded for the digital exploitation of their performances.
