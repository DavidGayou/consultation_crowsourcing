            I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

1.           [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which
you live?
         - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)



                                                                                               2
    NO OPINION




2.           [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).


    NO OPINION




3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]


-        None.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]




5.             [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to
certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
    YES – Please explain by giving examples


    NO OPINION


-             It is often expensive to set up a commercial platform in other countries and to
              secure proper surveillance and payment and to avoid copyright infringements.

                                                                                              3
6.            [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to
a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples


  NO OPINION


7.           Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of
content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for
right holders?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain


   -    Copyright actually provides solutions to a number of problems that would otherwise
        be left to law of contracts, which is exactly the case in relation to sports rights.
        Removing the possibility of territorially restricting copyright licenses might not have
        the intended effect, but may instead lead to more complex contractual regulation
        which could limit the access to cultural content from other European countries.



8.          Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
  YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)


   -    The question is best answered through case law in the EU Court of Justice which will
        tale into regard specificities of different situations which is not suitable for legislative
        solutions.
        The scope of “making available” online is much wider and much more diverse than in
        the case of satellite broadcasting. Therefore, the “country of origin” principle which
        has worked for satellite transmission would undermine copyright protection if
        transferred to the making available right.




9.           [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have

                                                                                                  4
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief)?
        – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


  NO OPINION


10.          [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application
of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")


  NO OPINION




11.          Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
  NO OPINION


12.         Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and
in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
       – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
      – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
  NO OPINION




13.          [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions
when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
        – Please explain by giving examples

                                                                                                    5
  NO OPINION




14.         [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be
the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
15.           Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


  NO
  NO OPINION




16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]
      -   With regard to audio-visual works, a lot of works are created during or immediately
          before live broadcast and simultaneous retransmission. The numerous contributors,
          and possible right holders in preexisting works that are used on a mass scale are
          impossible to know beforehand, and a registration system would not necessarily help
          regarding the licensing of for instance cable-retransmission. In relation to works
          existing prior to the creation of such a system, vast funds would be required, in order
          to have a covering registry. We find, however, that a system with identifiers and
          digital ID would overall benefit the copyright administration.



18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

                                                                                               6
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


19.         What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]

-              It is important to ensure that rightsholders receive remuneration for the use of
               their works; therefore identifiers is a useful tool. The Commission could
               contribute by proposing standardization systems.


20.        Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
    YES – Please explain
         – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
    NO OPINION



    II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.          Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
          – Please explain by referring to specific cases
    NO – Please explain



22.          Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
          – Please explain by referring to specific cases
    NO – Please explain


     -   Exceptions that are too broad and not balanced damage the cultural production as
         content creators loose encouragement to create new works. Exceptions to copyright
         should only be applied as a measure of last resort; licensing should be the preferred
         solution. In different member states different levels of licensing tools and solutions
         exist. We think the best approach is to seek to strengthen licensing solutions though
         positive and constructive initiatives such as Licences for Europe. Creating mandatory
         exceptions would damage existing licensing models and thus damage the creation of
         jobs in the creative sector. It is the experience of Danish Writers Guild that the users


                                                                                               7
         prefer flexibility through licensing in stead of having to rely on exceptions and
         limitations to the exclusive right of authors.


23.           Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
         – Please explain why
    NO – Please explain why


-              Licensing is much more flexible than limitations and exceptions. A broad
               exception or limitation will not be a real assistance for anybody in the copyright
               field – except for the lawyers who will argue in the many court cases.


25.           If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]
     -   A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even in the USA,
         where common law is used, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding
         new forms of use, even with decades of judgments concerning fair use. Periodic
         revision would be a problem as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived
         balance of thousands and thousands of contracts. Danish Writers Guild believes that
         specific exceptions combined with flexible licensing solutions will meet the demands
         of users, rightsholders and the market better than a general fair use exception.



26.           Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem?
    YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
    NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
    NO OPINION



                                                                                               8
27.          In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were
to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
28.           (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or
other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
          – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.


  NO OPINION




29.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



30.         If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



31.             If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
      -   Licensing, both individual and collective licensing provides a more flexible solution to
          both users and rightsholders. That was also a conclusion in the Commission’s
          Licences for Europe project.




                                                                                                9
32.          (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
      -   Collections in national institutes are often in the national language. Therefore, there is
          no significant demand for access to Danish collections from other countries. In
          Denmark, there are numerous agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and
          archives. The budget of these are often linked to public service obligations – which are
          limited to the relevant member state, and their funding therefor does not allow for
          entering into cross-border licenses.
          The general extended collective licensing (ECL) provision in the Danish Copyright
          Act can be used as the legal foundation for a collective agreement. It is mentioned in
          the explanatory notes to Section 50(2) that the provision can be applied when the
          cultural heritage is to be digitized.



33.             If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
      -   The orphan works directive is being implemented in member states, and relevant
          stakeholders have agreed upon key principles on digitizing and making available of
          out-of-commerce works in the 2011 MoU. There should be a follow-up on the legal
          basis of the cross border availability as regards the 2011 MoU which would create
          more legal certainty and facilitate licensing.


34.         If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

36.          (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?

to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).


38.          [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in
the management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



39.           [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


                                                                                             11
……………………………………………………………………………………………….



40.           [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it
be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
        – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
  NO – Please explain


   -   With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing the general ECL
       provision (sec. 50(2)), users, such as libraries, and collecting societies were enabled to
       enter into mass digitization projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help
       facilitate digitizing the Danish cultural heritage and mass digitization projects which
       include orphan works.
       The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark.
       Such ECL licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective
       licensing (ECL) only applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such
       licenses cross-border effect, it would require that licenses based on ECL or other
       forms of collective rights management issued in one member state will be recognized
       in other member states. In the 2011 MoU it is written in preamble 11: “calling on the
       European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-
       border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted …”.
       In Denmark the legislation is in place, but whether or not national legislation is
       required in other countries can only be answered when the EU introduces a solution in
       relation to the 2011 MoU.


41.         Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed
for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
archives)?

42.            (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:]
Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter
for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?


                                                                                              12

      -   In Denmark, the system of ECL licensing agreements with schools, universities etc.
          functions very well to the benefit for both rightsholders and educational institutions.
          Licensing means flexibility and avoidance of uncertainty regarding the understanding
          of an exception limited to “illustration” for educational purposes.



43.             If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
      -   In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight forward access to
          content, while ensuring the rightsholders are remunerated for the exploitation of their
          works.
          There are licenses for numerous uses of audiovisual material in teaching, through the
          extended collective license (ECL) and individual mandates in Denmark. This includes
          the recording and streaming of TV and film in schools, by teachers and students. This
          also covers the use of large amounts of European content.


44.            What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
      -   In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing (ECL). Because ECL based
          licenses include all works of all artists of a defined type it can provide the broadest
          possible access to use of content and a high level of legal security for the users. At the
          same time it provides rightsholders with remuneration for the exploitation of their
          works and support that content creators are able and encouraged to continue creating
          new works. The system is accepted by both educational institutions and rightsholders
          and has been for many years, which is the best testimony of its success.
          The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables Copydan to clear the
          rights for a lot of different uses in schools, but as mentioned individual mandate
          agreements are also used. The agreements are very successful, and the main licenses
          cover almost 100 % of all schools in Denmark.
          Copydan in general collects annually millions of euro in remuneration to Danish and
          foreign rights holder for use of protected subject-matter in educational institutions.
          Hence, these funds are important for the possibility of producing and distributing new
          creative content to the benefit of the educational system. Specifically for the authors
          represented by Danish Writers Guild these funds are essential; the collective
          management fee are very often key for the possibility of an author to continue to write
          which, eventually, also benefits the schools; without new creative content of high
          quality the students will get a poorer education.

64.          In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions1 in the digital environment?
         – Please explain
       – Please explain
    NO OPINION

65.           Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?2

       – Please explain
    NO OPINION



66.           How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
(e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the
one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

         IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers


72.           [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
-            Danish Writers Guild believes that EU law should introduce a general provision,
             similar to the one in German legislation, to secure that authors receive a fair
             remuneration when they transfer rights to producers, publishers, TV stations etc.

                                                                                           19
              The present silence in EU legislation makes it difficult for authors to achieve
              fair remuneration in negotiations with the counter parties. EU law should also
              encourage general agreements between unions and trade organizations
              regarding, inter alia, clauses on transfer of copyright and remuneration in order
              to achieve a well-functioning market. Also mediation – as envisaged i Recital 46
              of the Infosoc Directive – and others forms of dispute settlement should be
              regulated at European level.


73.          Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses
in contracts)?
    YES – Please explain
       – Please explain why
    NO OPINION

-             Yes, see answer to Q72.

74.          If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you
suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

-             Yes, see answer to Q72.



    V. Respect for rights
75.         Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
    YES – Please explain
       – Please explain
    NO OPINION
-             Especially on the Internet it is often very complicated and expensive to enforce
              the author’s rights. It is quite easy for infringer to evade enforcement which is
              detrimental to the effective protection of the authors,


76.            In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for
sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online
copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful
to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
                                                                                            20

77.           Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

       – Please explain
  NO OPINION




             VI.           A single EU Copyright Title

78.          Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright
across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


  NO



79.          Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does
the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
longer term project?
[Open question]

         VII.               Other issues
