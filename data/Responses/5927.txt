EC public consultation: Review of EU copyright rules

On behalf of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, we hereby submit the following contribution to
Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules. It is based largely on the submitted
contribution of the Swedish IT and Telecom Industries (IT&Telekomföretagen inom Almega), with
whom we have worked in drafting their contribution.


        Today’s term of copyright protection in the EU is too long. A good parameter for copyright’s
         term of protection could be that of patents, i.e. 20 years.
        Licensing of copyrighted material for use in digital services should be greatly simplified.
        Data-driven innovation is considered of increasingly higher importance for science, innovation
         policy and economic growth. In light of such relevance, in our view the European Commission
         should take action to make it clear that text and data mining of lawfully accessed content is
         not an infringement of copyright.
        The provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under
         copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, should not be subject to the
         authorization of the right holder.
        Levies should not be extended to the digital environment. It would, i.a., deter investments in
         new online services and slow revenue growth for creative industries, hamper economic
         growth and innovation, and lead to a segmentation of the single market.
        Member states’ levy regimes differ substantially in regards to scope and tariffs, creating cross-
         border obstacles and undermining the emergence of a Digital Single Market.
        The current legal framework on ISP liability, as interpreted by the CJEU with regard to the
         legitimacy of certain online copyright enforcement measures, should remain unchanged. A fair
         balance between the purpose of enforcing copyright online and the protection of Internet user
         privacy and personal data is guaranteed by the way the CJEU has interpreted EU law in
         recent rulings.
        We believe that the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title is a long-term solution that
         should be examined and pondered carefully. However, we think this reform would be
         premature at this stage.
