      I. Introduction

A.      Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the
ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have
materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song),
for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for
activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access
content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of
geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to
continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the
legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement
remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation
focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright
regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth
and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market" 1 the Commission set
out two parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to
review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a
decision in 2014 on whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other,
to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue
"Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and
possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now 4. The Commission
welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and
will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content,
audiovisual and film heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the
Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making the user
environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did
not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital
Single Market, i.e.: "territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations
and exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright

market; and how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while
underpinning its legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted
in the October 2013 European Council Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and
content across the single market requires the establishment of a copyright regime
for the digital age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review of
the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to modernise Europe's
copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular
those on the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green
Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online"8. These
consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of
questions, on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to
overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge,
and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were
expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right
holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely
diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the
"Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into
subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the
current review process.

II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content
services from anywhere in Europe?

[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not
enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a
bundle of national rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely
harmonised by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and the
geographical scope of the rights is limited to the territory of the Member State
granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and
enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music
streaming service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an
authorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the
public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-
European licence, such that content services can be provided in several Member
States and across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive on Collective Rights
Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-territorial licences
in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences
for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border
portability, i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their
Member State to keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint
statement affirming their commitment to continue working towards the further
development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of,
and access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to
access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in
which they live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and
consumers face problems when trying to access such services across borders. In

   This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works

     Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights
for musical works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right
holders such as film or record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

                                                                                                           8
some instances, even if the “same” service is available in all Member States,
consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can only access their
“national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another Member
State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).
This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties
associated with the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses
in licensing agreements between right holders and distributors and/or between
distributors and end users may also be at the origin of some of the problems (denial
of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the
medium term15 to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.    [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the
one in which you live?
X YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the
type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV
series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and
newspapers, games, applications and other software)


The digital environment offers new possibilities and opportunities for both creators
and consumers. EU consumers have an unprecedented cultural sector on their
doorstep, but the barriers preventing them from accessing content are
overwhelming.


Consumers wish to access creative content on any media platform and in a way
which allows them to choose the time when they view, read or listen to that
content. This applies to audiovisual media services, radio and other online services,
regardless of whether these are provided at national or European level. In the digital
age, citizens want to access the same content on different platforms or across
borders and should expect to be able to do so without impediment.


However, consumers are regularly confronted with access restrictions from certain
services depending on the geographic location of their IP- address. Consumers
seeking to buy copyright protected content online are often only allowed access to
online stores directed to their country of residence. Such barriers lead to a
significant reduction of choice for consumers, particularly for consumers from those
Member States where there is a less abundant service offer. In addition,
territoriality of copyright may lead to price discrimination to the detriment of
consumers. In fact, right holders tend to define markets along national borders and
set different prices and conditions for identical products and services in each
Member State.

   For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code
(establishing a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.


                                                                                            9
We are confident that the establishment of a legal regime that would allow all
consumers within the European Community to buy content online on a pan-
European basis at a fair price has the potential to contribute to the significant
reduction of unauthorised use of copyright-protected material. Where business
models have been developed and tried, the results have been promising. However,
it is important to ensure that these business models are equally available to all
consumers within the European Community.


2.   [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
X YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to
copyright or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing
services across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)?
Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software).


Commercial users are confronted with divergent rules and rights when trying to
establish legal offers for copyright protected content. The main problem relates to
the significant transaction costs related to acquiring of rights to offer services across
Europe. Rights clearance can be long winded and expensive and the fees charged by
right holders may not support a start-up service that still has to build a customer
base and advertising revenues.


Spotify was not available in every EU Member State a full four years after its launch
and had to undergo long discussions with the GEMA (the German Collecting Society)
before launching the service in Germany due to excessive fee requests. Similarly,
Netflix currently faces long discussions and negotiations before being able to launch
its services in different EU Member States.


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content
concerned.

4.     If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]


BEUC has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform of copyright law. Copyright
law exists to encourage creativity and innovation for the benefit of society as a
whole. However, we believe that the current copyright framework fails to “keep
pace” with the rapid digital developments. Digital technologies have fundamentally
transformed and have called into question the “traditional” distribution system of
the content and information industry, laying bare its inefficiency and its incapacity
to adapt to the challenges of the digital environment.


The Information Society Directive 2001/29 has failed to achieve the objectives of
establishing a Digital Single Market for creative content and harmonising national
copyright legislation. Significant divergences exist in regard to the scope of the
exceptions and limitations - which creates legal uncertainty for both consumers and
creators.


In addition, the current copyright framework, which is based on an exhaustive list of
optional exceptions and limitations, lacks sufficient flexibility to take account of
technological developments. A dynamically developing market, such as the market
for online content, requires a flexible legal framework that allows new and socially
valuable uses which do not affect the normal exploitation of copyright works to
develop without the copyright owner’s permission.


Despite the increasing relevance of copyright law to their daily lives consumers are
provided with hardly any information when it comes to copyright. Consumers are
never quite sure what is legal and illegal under current copyright law. In many
Member States, copyright law makes the everyday activities of consumers, such as
backing up and copying legally bought music, films and e-books in order to play on
a different device, illegal. Under current laws, parodies and pastiches which have
gained new cultural relevance in the digital ‘mash up’ culture are illegal.


We call upon the European Commission to revise the Copyright Directive as
a matter of urgency in order to establish a simple, consumer friendly legal
framework for accessing digital content in Europe's single market, while
ensuring at the same time fair remuneration of creators.




5.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it
necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider
(in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not
possible in certain European countries)?

                                                                                  11
X YES – Please explain by giving examples


BEUC regrets that rightholders and collective management organisations consider it
appropriate to create such restrictions, as the purpose of creating content should
surely be to share with a maximum of users and hence to enable a maximum of
users to access it. Such practices may constitute an infringement on the freedom to
provide services within the EU or competition law.


6.      [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary
rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or
justified to impose territorial restrictions on the service recipient (in order
for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website than the one
he is trying to access)?


X NO OPINION


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


X YES – Please explain


As outlined above, BEUC calls for a revision of the Information Society Directive.
The revision should focus on the following issues:


- Pursue the harmonisation of copyright exceptions and limitations; whereas we
welcome more harmonisation, we consider that full harmonisation is not possible
and we consider the discussion to be premature;


- Copyright exceptions should be made mandatory and it should not be possible for
them to be overruled by contractual terms and conditions and technical protection
measures as for example digital right management systems; The primary focus
should be on the current set of copyright exceptions and limitations and the
recognition of a clear set of users’ rights. These should include those current
limitations that are of direct interest to consumers, namely the private copying
exceptions, as well as those reflecting fundamental rights and freedoms. The
establishment of rights should become a central aspect of the European copyright
framework;


- The current legal situation results in an unequal treatment of "physical" (e.g.
book) and "intangible", digital works (e.g. eBook) and thus in inappropriate

                                                                                    12
consequences for consumers. In the eyes of consumers, it makes no difference
whether they buy a printed book or an eBook. In both cases, consumers pay for the
purchase of the work and for being able to permanently and freely utilise it. This
includes the possibility of long-term access to the work, regardless of the device
manufacturer or other restrictions from the content provider (e.g. continuance of a
user account).




B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of
what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation
of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other
EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring
rightholders19 which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works
(e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format)
over the internet or similar digital networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the
right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of
the transmission – e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view
of making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital
copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the
rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks 21.
These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be
cleared.

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring
rights” in, respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected
by copyright is referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any
means and in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary
acts of reproduction of a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see
art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and
to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive
2001/29/EC).

nor where the act of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if
the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the
transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of
"making available" happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where
the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the
copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries
which are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service provider “targets”
a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that
group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically
targeted at that group.
8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations –
   i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


X NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification
would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country
of origin" approach23)


The Copyright Directive does not address questions of conflicts of law , arising in
situations where a work is made available to the public in one Member State but is
accessed from another Member State. It should be noted that an application of the
country of origin’s law would require a comprehensive harmonisation across Member
States regarding copyright limitations, rights ownership, transfer of rights, scope of
protection and collective management of copyright- issues which the present
Directive does not address to a large extent. For these reasons, it may seem
appropriate to apply the law of the country or the countries in which the work that
has been publicly communicated can be, or was intended to be, received (Concise
European Copyright Law, Kluwer Law International).


9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
   scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition
   of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not,
   whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on
   your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
   availability of injunctive relief24)?


22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for
copyright and related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney
vs KDG Mediatech).
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant
act that must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for
example the Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is
established), regardless of in how many Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such
an approach has already been introduced at EU level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see
Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to
copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

2.     Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of
technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights
that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the
two rights are held by different persons/entities.

10.       [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the
application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
X YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address
such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different
hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


BEUC considers that the traditional practice of licensing separately the reproduction
right and the making available right is not fit for purpose in the digital environment.
The advent of the Internet has prompted new channels of digital distribution, but
the contractual divide remains. As a result, these two sets of rights have to be
cleared, as opposed to clearing a single making available right, thus adding to the
complexity of making content accessible to consumers.



3.     Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet
to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network.
Several cases are pending before the CJEU 25 in which the question has been raised
whether the provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary
copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen
and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the
CJEU26 as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception
for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/29/EC.

11.Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
   matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific
   circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered
by a copyright exception)


The ability to freely link from one resource to another is one of the fundamental
building blocks of the Internet. Users do it every day when they post a Facebook
update, put a tweet on Twitter, write a blog post, comment, etc. Requiring the
authorisation of rights holders before being allowed to place a link to a resource that
is available online would break the internet as we know it and lead to a nightmarish
permission culture. BEUC supports the analysis by the “European Copyright
Society”, consisting of independent copyright scholars, according to which
hyperlinking in general should not be considered an act of communication to the
public.


In addition to the question how to treat hyperlinks it is important to point out the
problem of embedding content to a website. The German Federal Court of Justice
raised the question how to treat embedding to the European Court of Justice. In our
opinion embedding must be treated the same as hyperlinking.




12.Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
   reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under
   copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user’s
   computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject
   to the authorisation of the rightholder?


X NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a
copyright exception)


A user browsing of the Internet regularly cerates temporary copies of works and
other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the computer. Requiring the authorisation of the right holder for viewing
and reading content that is already available amounts to an additional permission
which could lead to citizens infringing the law by merely surfing on the Internet.




                                                                                    16
4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download
to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they
buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle
of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of
physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article) 27. The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an
act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer
acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions, notably relating
to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and
using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the
“forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate
(in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).




13.    [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g.
mp3 file, e-book)?


X YES – Please explain by giving examples




The current legal situation results in an unequal treatment of "physical" (e.g. book)
and "intangible", digital works (e.g. eBook) and thus in inappropriate consequences
for consumers. In the eyes of consumers, it makes no difference whether they buy a
printed book or an eBook. In both cases, consumers pay for the purchase of the
work and for being able to permanently and freely utilise it. This includes the
possibility of long-term access to the work, regardless of the device manufacturer or
other restrictions from the content provider (e.g. continuance of a user account).


BEUC believes that there is no justification to discriminate against the purchasers of
immaterial copies (mainly downloads of songs, movies or computer games) against
those of copies on physical media (such as CDs, DVDs or DVDROMs). It is at least
uncertain whether and under which circumstances a user of a commercial download



27
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of
a second-hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it
for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program
covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution
right may be subject to exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download with the right
holder’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached this decision based on the
Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in
relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).


                                                                                                            17
service like iTunes is allowed to re-sell a music album. Reselling a CD of the same
album on the other hand is undisputedly legal.


Bearing in mind the fact that the ongoing substitution of the market for physical
copies by a market for non-physical ones mainly benefits the suppliers' side, such
an unequal treatment seems unjustified.


BEUC calls upon the European Commission to carefully assess the consumer
detriment from the existing discrimination between physical and digital content as
well as the potential benefits from remedying the current situation.

C.   Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a
good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection
and exercise of rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute 29. Moreover a
system of registration does not need to be made compulsory or constitute
a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. With a longer term of
protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology provides for
the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not have
been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration
are increasingly being considered 30.

15.    Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
X YES


16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]



29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing
the formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online
database is currently being set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for
the registration of orphan works.


                                                                                                       18
BEUC welcomes the launch of a discussion with regards the creation of a registration
system at EU level. The advantages and disadvantages of such a system would
depend on its design.


On the one hand, the creation of a registration system for copyright, will enable the
creation of data about the existence and duration of copyright for the work in
question, and about who owns the copyright. It will also facilitate licensing by
lowering the cost of identifying rightsholders,


On the other hand, given the easiness of creating new works, imposing a
registration system on authors for every piece of content they create would be
burdensome. Furthermore, the implementation and maintenance of such a system
would entail significant costs.


It is useful to evaluate the situation in the United States. Prior to the United States
joining the Berne Convention, copyrighted works that were not registered with the
U.S. Library of Congress entered the public domain. Many experts believe that it is
a mistake to extend protection to all works, regardless of copyright registration, and
that this practice has dramatically expanded the number of protected works to
include countless works that are not actively exploited by copyright owners,
including those for which it is difficult to establish ownership, or where it is difficult
to know when terms of protection have expired.


The growth of the Internet has opened up new possibilities for public access to and
use of creative works that did not exist at the time of the Berne Convention. The
majority of creative works have little or no commercial value, and the value of many
initially successful works is quickly exhausted. For works that are not producing
revenues, continued copyright protection serves no economic interest of the author.
But in a system without any formal requirement for copyright protection,
commercially “dead” works are nonetheless locked up. They cannot be used as
building blocks for (potentially valuable) new works without permission, and the
cost of obtaining permission will often prevent use (Source: Reform(aliz)ing
copyright by Christopher Sprigman).
17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by
producers, collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries,
which are based to a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a
reference number embedded in a work, are specific to the sector in which they have
been developed31, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable examples of where
industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers and
databases. The Global Repertoire Database 32 should, once operational, provide a
single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks
for the expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a
comprehensive data model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK
Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification systems a step further, and to
create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
N/A

E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of
time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain
and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules
on moral rights). The Berne Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of
50 years after the death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of protection
to 70 years after the death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term
provided for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in
international agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the
first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do
not benefit from such an extended term of protection.


20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
digital environment?
X NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the
International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

BEUC believes that the current term of protection for copyright and related rights do
not reflect the needs and the reality of the digital environment. Although we agree
that better protection of authors is needed, a “longer” term of protection does not
mean “better” protection for authors.


Instead, the best way of improving performers’ earnings would be to ensure they
receive a fair share of the revenues generated from their creativity from the date of
publication as most earnings are likely to be in the early years following release. In
addition, clearer rules of transfer of rights to the benefit of performers, tackling
unfair terms in recording contracts and social protection measures should be
considered to improve performers’ welfare.


Long terms of protection prove to be counter-productive and a burden to innovation,
threatening to shrink the public domain and to increase end prices for consumers.
Longer terms of protection will impede the transfer of content into the public domain
after the expiry of the current term. Works in the public domain are freely
accessible by the general public and can be used for the benefit of future innovation
and as a source of knowledge


The balance of interests between rights holders and users is endangered by the
extension of the duration of intellectual property rights, which should not extend
beyond the time necessary to provide incentives to create and distribute. Extending
this term of protection runs counter to the Commission's declared objective of
increasing the possibilities for access to creative content and services and of
supporting innovative business models and legal offers.


Any development of copyright law should be based on an independent assessment
of the costs and benefits to society as a whole.

III.        Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works
and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the
rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for
illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At
EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect
international law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases


36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal
protection of computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
37
   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971);
Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of
the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
(1996).


                                                                                                        21
which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter
and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU
level)38, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that
Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them
as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions
is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and
to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth
noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms
of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e.
has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the
limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by
an exception in a Member State "A" may still require the authorisation of the
rightholder once we move to the Member State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to
compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception
to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to
provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism
of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used
for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State "A" and
the students are in a Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should
pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best
mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt
when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to
confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main
question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU
and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal
certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's
international obligations.

21.   Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the
Member States?
X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


38
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in
Member States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
39
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the
Database Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works
Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to
copyright and related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located)
has been given a cross-border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be
considered an orphan work in all Member States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.


                                                                                                       22
Copyright law exists to encourage creativity and innovation for the benefit of society
as a whole. However, we believe that the current copyright framework fails to “keep
pace” with the rapid digital developments. Digital technologies have fundamentally
transformed and have called into question the “traditional” distribution system of
the content and information industry, laying bare its inefficiency and its incapacity
to adapt to the challenges of the digital environment.

There is a need to restore the balance between rights and exceptions – a balance
that is currently skewed by the fact that the harmonisation Directives mandate basic
economic rights, but merely permit certain exceptions and limitations.

From a consumer’s perspective, copyright’s current balance is far from perfect. A
number of permitted uses of copyright-protected material are only allowed as
exceptions and limitations to the copyright owners’ exclusive rights. However, these
exceptions and limitations are not absolute conditions and consumers often face
unclear boundaries as to which acts are permitted under the current copyright
legislation.

Exceptions to, and limitations on, right holders’ exclusive rights are an important
mechanism for achieving balance in copyright law. They are the way in which public
and consumer fair use rights are expressed.

While appropriate levels of copyright protection can stimulate investment and
production of content, thoughtful exceptions are equally essential to the Knowledge
Economy by permitting technological development and ensuring that access to
knowledge fuels production of more knowledge. The need to encourage new works
has to be put in perspective with the importance of exceptions to provide the
appropriate conditions for creation, innovation, access to knowledge and the
development of the information society.

The Copyright Directive was adopted with the aim to harmonise national laws and
facilitate the creation of a Single Market for creative works. However, the objective
of harmonisation has not been achieved. There remain significant divergences in the
copyright laws of EU Member States, namely as regards the exceptions and
limitations. These differences create barriers to free movement of copyrighted works
and distort the conditions for competition in the dissemination of works. The
exhaustive nature of the list of exceptions provided in the Copyright Directive has
prevented Member States from adapting the copyright framework to the new
technologies.


22.Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is
   there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


X YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


In contrast to consumer rights, exceptions on copyright are not considered ‘‘rights’’
in their own merit, but simply exceptions to right holders’ exclusive rights. The
provisions in copyright law permitting certain unauthorized acts in relation to
protected works are a deviation from the general principle of the right holder’s
exclusivity and generally not a user’s right.
                                                                                   23
It follows from this that consumers have no direct enforceable claim against right
holders to demand the application of an exception. As a result, right holders can
easily set them aside either through the application of Technical Protection Measures
(TMPs) or through contractual clauses.


The Copyright Directive fails to immunise the permitted uses of copyrighted content
against restrictions imposed by such contractual agreements. In practice, the
application of a TPM or a clause included in the end use licensing agreement may
result in preventing the consumer from exercising the exception of private copy
recognized in that same Directive.


It is important to note that the Computer Programme Directive already establishes
the rights for users to make back-up copies, while the Database Directive allows for
the making of a copy without the permission of the right owner. Both these
provisions are not considered as exceptions, but as rights of the user that cannot be
circumvented by contract. In addition, they are mandatory for all Member States.


The primary focus should be on those current limitations that are of direct interest
to consumers, namely the private copying exceptions, as well as those reflecting
fundamental rights and freedoms. These would include at the very least rights of
quotation and criticism, a right of news reporting, a right of parody, basic scientific
and educational freedoms, some library and archive limitations, and exceptions for
the visually impaired.




23.Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from
   the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]


BEUC would caution against the removal of any exception from the current list of
the Copyright Directive. Copyright exceptions and limitations are the mechanism by
which the rights of creators are balanced with the rights of society and the public
interest.


The focus should be on further harmonising the existing exceptions and limitations
and make them mandatory. In parallel, a new exception should be included to
address the issue of User-Generated Content (UCG). Please see response to
Questions 58-63.


24.    Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide
for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
limitations and exceptions?



                                                                                    24
X YES – Please explain why


BEUC strongly believes that some flexibility needs to be introduced in the Copyright
Directive. A list of closed and strictly defined exceptions is not appropriate to the
fast evolving digital environment and the Internet.


It is crucial for the exception regime to be flexible and forward-looking, so as to
anticipate and facilitate changes. Failing to do so will put Europe at a competitive
disadvantage with countries providing for such flexibility such as the U.S. with the
application of the fair use doctrine.


Copyright rules must evolve as the technologies that are used to create and
distribute them evolve. It is important not to construe the protection of copyright
and promotion of copyright exceptions as contradictory objectives, or the interests
of sectors relying on exceptions as opposed to the interest of sectors relying on
protection. On the contrary, these are complementary objectives and interests that
are both fostering the development of knowledge and creation and their
dissemination.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the
directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the
form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]


BEUC believes than an open norm permitting specific uses that could not be
foreseen alongside the list of exceptions to be made mandatory is the optimal
solution. The co-existence of specific exceptions with a new ‘open clause’ would give
rise to a mixed system where courts could permit uses that are similar (but not
identical) to the ones expressly enumerated by the law.


Such a mixed system would allow for the necessary flexibility to adapt to new
technologies and for innovative services to develop. However, it might result in
higher degree of legal uncertainty due to the overreliance on the courts to provide
an assessment on a case by case basis.


BEUC calls upon the European Commission to further examine the application of the
fair use doctrine in those countries where it already exists and to assess the impact
of the introduction of a similar standard in EU copyright law.




                                                                                  25
26.Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
   constitute a problem?


X YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


The territoriality of copyright exceptions and limitations is a major problem that
hinders the development of innovative cross-border services and results in legal
uncertainty for all stakeholders involved. What may be a permitted use in one
Member States might be illegal in another. We provide examples of significant
national implementation of the copyright exceptions and limitations in the respective
questions.


The territoriality of copyright exceptions and limitations also hinders the effective
enforcement of copyright law, given that the same behaviour might constitute an
infringement in one country but might be covered by an exception in another; in
such cases, the burden of proof lies with the right holder seeking to enforce his
rights in multiple Member States.


These problems are only likely to become more acute in the future because
copyright law is territorial, but the Internet is global and facilitates flows of
information services across borders.




27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair
compensation” be addressed, when such compensation is part of the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]


Fair compensation must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of the
harm caused to authors of protected works by the introduction of a specific
exception. Furthermore, when the harm is only minimal there should be no
compensation. The Copyright Directive refers to ‘fair compensation” which is
different from the notion of “equitable remuneration” which is based on the notion
that authors have a right to remuneration for each and every usage of their works.
On the contrary, “fair compensation” is only due when there is actual economic
harm which is more than minimal.




A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range
of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries,




                                                                                  26
educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented,
these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site
consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such
institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by
the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the
objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in
digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a
possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter
and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and
possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be
considered here.

1.         Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration
or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of
another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States
provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such
preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to
Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the
number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the
current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and
archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive
specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems
with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives
of the preservation exception?


X YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.


The development of digital libraries in recent years has the potential to change the
way works are accessed to, enjoyed and used. Today, digitization of works could
provide extended value to access to works, by maintaining the work in a quality that
secures its future and frequent consultation, by adding search tools to the digitized
items, by offering on-line lending that could seem equivalent for users to the
acquisition of an e-book on the market. Digitization is also a privileged way to
increase availability of collections and to envisage their dissemination on-line.

The study on the application of the Directive 2001/29 provides a rather extensive
overview of cases where the current exception fails to keep pace with the
technology development. The assessment of the exception in the directive and in its
national transpositions has showed two significant issues. Current needs of
preservation are not permitted by the exception, either due to uncertainty of its
scope or to developments that could not be envisaged at the time of adoption of the
directive. A second issue results from the very diverse implementation of the
exception in the Member States that creates a fragmented scene for a European
agenda of digitization of cultural heritage.


29.   If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

BEUC calls for a revision of the Copyright Directive in order to adapt the current
exception. The current exception was adopted at a time where libraries were only
emerging as digital actors. The hot topic of “digital libraries” would be created only a
few years afterwards. The needs of libraries and cultural heritage institutions evolve,
as well as their activities. Consequently the extent of the authorized acts could
evolve to allow for some new activities.



30.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be
covered and under which conditions?
[Open question]


BEUC supports the extension of the existing exception for preservation to include all
types of copyrighted content, including recorded music, film and broadcast. It is not
acceptable that important historical records in these formats should not be
preserved.


Recorded music, film and broadcast were popularised in the early to mid 20 th
Century and have been used to document important social and cultural
developments over time. Libraries and archives should not continue to incur the
transaction costs associated with getting permission for preservation copies of
recorded music, film and broadcast, or be subject to legal risk when they make
preservation copies in the absence of formal permission by the copyright owner.


Recorded music, film and broadcast are stored on ever changing mediums, such as
cellulite film, and long term preservation requires format-shifting as formats become
outdated, the hardware required to read them becomes unavailable, and mediums
such as cellulite film degrade as they age.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other
subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated
terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and
private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely
(i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires
authorisation     and    is   generally  addressed    in   agreements     between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than
agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting
online access to collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders
that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your
collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements
with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote
access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in
their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
[Open question]

The study on the application of the Directive 2001/29 identifies the technical
limitation of the consultation to dedicated terminals as main problem wit regards to
the specific exception. The requirement of ‘dedicated terminals’ is outdated and too
narrow and does not grant enough leeway to libraries. Viewing some digital works
does not have any longer to be done on adapted devices but can be undertaken by
anyone using a digital device such as a computer, tablet or even a smart phone.


When the Directive was adopted, on-site consultation was considered as being a
peripheral service offered by the libraries for some specific works whose digital
browsing was preferred, libraries’ users and researchers are now accustomed to
view research or study material in a digital format and on the screens of their
computers and expect to be able to do the same in a library or archive. They should
be entitled to consult the works made available by their libraries from their offices
or at distance through a secured connection.


33.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
BEUC supports the conclusion of the study on the application of the Directive that
the exception should be revised and that the focus of the revision should be on the
requirements of dedicated terminal and limitation to the premises of the eligible
establishment.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books,
sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments
have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary
access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the
current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights
holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers
and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the
making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by
publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.    (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials
held in your collection?

specific problems when trying to borrow books or other materials

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such
as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their
collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make
them available to the public. Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels
form the early part of the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical
value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and
making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in
the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between
libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies
representing authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is
ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for
instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU
is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on
the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member
States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such
licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences
granted)45.

40.[In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in
   mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management
   organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation
   to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements
   concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
   border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the
   EU?

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French
act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles
du xxe siècle) foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes
such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und
einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are not
members of the collecting society.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national
legislation limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-
commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of
or full works to illustrate his course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a
book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected content on a
smart board without having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementation at
Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from Member
State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law
should provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people
with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather
different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level
projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other
subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of
works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the
European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty
creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to
produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired
persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States
have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of
certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible
format copies across borders).

(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific

X YES – Please explain by giving examples


The main problem relates to the narrow scope of the exception as implemented into
national law. Whereas the Information Society Directive mentions as the
beneficiaries of the exception people with a “disability”, without narrowing down on
the kind of disability or the intensity of the disability, Member States have limited
the scope. France is an example of a country that has introduced restrictions
regarding the intensity of the handicap; whereas in the UK the exception is reserved
to visually impaired persons.


The divergent scope of the exception in national copyright laws has a major impact
on the cross-borer accessibility of works. Given the major differences, it is
impossible for an EU-wide service to offer access to accessible copies in each and
every Member State.


51.If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]


Article 30 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities
recognises the right to “enjoy access to television programmes, films, theatre and
other cultural activities, in accessible formats”. Disabled people should be able to
access all the services available to others and therefore a fundamental right should
be recognised in EU law. These people are unable to interact with digital content
unless the content is made accessible.


BEUC believes that the exception in favour of people with a disability should be
made mandatory and have a clearly defined scope with regards to the rights
concerned.

computer), prior to the actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine
protected works or other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation from
the right holders for the making of such copies unless such authorisation can be
implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without restrictions on the
internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the
exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others
consider that text and data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by
copyright. None of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does not
consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in several different ways.
Important questions also remain as to whether the main problems arising in relation
to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the
authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences
for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating
stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same
time, practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based
scientific content were presented by publishers as an outcome of “Licences for
Europe”52. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued that no
additional licences should be required to mine material to which access has been
provided through a subscription agreement and considered that a specific exception
for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of a distinction
between commercial and non-commercial.

BEUC supports the principle of freedom of access to information when used to the
benefit of society as a whole.

There is no question that data mining, the practice of examining large databases in
order to generate new information, is an exciting area of scientific research and
promises to lead to important new discoveries in a number of areas. To do that the
underlying data needs to be accessed, analysed and linked to existing information.

The current legal framework has led to a situation where it is often unclear what
types of data mining activities are permitted. It causes problems for researchers,
with unhelpful complexity in licensing. Current requirements to seek permission to
text or data mine are not proportionate, cost effective, or scalable. There is the
need to check whether material could be legally mined under current contracts,
which was not always evidence. When additional permissions are required,
academics often do not know how to seek permission. An additional hurdle relates
to the high transactional costs for text and data mining.

There are also problems with the number and different types of licences that need
to be dealt with. Even for basic use, researchers need to look at licensing
restrictions for each article with terms that vary greatly. To use the breadth of
works needed for much successful data and text mining require working through a
wide variety of contractual circumstances.

Text mining has been around for a long time now, but has not grown in usage
because people see the barriers as too high (Source: Copyright Consultation event:
Proposed Exception for Text and Data Mining, Intellectual Property Office, London,
Tuesday 13 March 2012).



54.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

To tap the full potential of data mining for innovation and scientific development and
to ensure legal certainty, BEUC supports the introduction of a specific copyright
exception designed to promote the non-commercial exploitation of works into the
copyright framework.



55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]

A copyright exception for text and data analytics would ensure that universities and
research institutions have the necessary legal protections to engage in large-scale,
non-commercial data mining activities. The exception should also become immune
to contractual restrictions so that it can not be overridden by terms included by
publishers in licensing agreements.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and
distribute content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of
online activities are developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-
generated content”. While users can create totally original content, they can also
take one or several pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and
upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs 53. User-generated
content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works even if the
newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort and
results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content
with other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However,
the development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to
share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased
the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-
use is no longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept elite. With the
possibilities offered by the new technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in
turn raises questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of
expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences
for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating
stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the
best way to respond to this phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception
is needed to cover UGC, in particular non-commercial activities by individuals such
as combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another
view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing
schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between rightholders
and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders and the
users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-
generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by

review etc.) in a blog.

The study on the application of the Directive 2001/29 provides a rather extensive
overview of cases where consumers experienced problems when trying to use pre-
existing works, going as far as being faced with legal actions. For example, under
existing copyright law there is no exception or limitation that would justify some
daily activities of consumers, such as the reuse of a song for a family video and the
posting it online; the video would be illegal on the grounds of copyright
infringement.

61.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


BEUC calls for a legislative solution to the issue of user-generated content. Only a
legislative solution will ensure legal certainty for all the parties involved and will
make user-generated content immune from copyright infringement.


As demonstrated by the failure of the License for Europe initiative, a voluntary
agreement between stakeholders in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding is
not an option. There remain significantly diverging views with regards to the
definition of UGC and the best way to address the problems faced by consumers.


Therefore, a legislative solution is the only possible way forward.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its
main elements? Which activities should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
BEUC supports the introduction of an UGC specific exception in the Copyright
Directive which would be mandatory for EU Member States to implement and will be
made unwaivable by contract.


Canada has already adopted a similar approach, creating a “safe harbour” for both
UGC uploaders and the hosting sites provided that a number of conditions are met.
- the pre-existing work has been published
- it is used to create a new work, so the mere copying is not covered by this
provision
- the use of the new work is done solely for non-commercial purposes
- the source and the name of the author are mentioned, if it is reasonable in the
circumstances to do so
- the person has reasonable grounds to believe that the existing work was not
infringing copyright


It is also important that user-generated content is clearly defined. Such a definition
should fall within the definition developed by the OECD, according to which User
created content is defined as content that is made publicly available over the
Internet, which reflects a certain amount of creative effort, and is created outside of
professional routines and practices”.


63.If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

                                                                                    40
[Open question]

An alternative to the introduction of a new exception specific for user-generated
content (UGC) could be the broadening of the scope of existing exceptions to
include UGC, namely the exceptions for parody and quotation.



IV.        Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for
private use and photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on
goods typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording equipment,
photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such as mp3/mp4 players,
computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders for the harm they suffer
when copies are made without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use of certain
technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to
whether the copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content
online - e.g. when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple
copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers,
or should trigger, the application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some
cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the
licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies made by the end user.
This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain
types of cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.    In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
application of the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the
digital environment?
X YES – Please explain
The optional character of the private copying exception and the divergence in the
way Member States have implemented it into national law have resulted in
significant uncertainty as to its scope.

In some countries, a set number of permitted copies is specified, in others
compensation is only due for private copying of music, in others for printed and
audio-visual works. For example, in Italy, the exception applies only to sound
recordings and audiovisual works, in Estonia only to audiovisual works.

BEUC strongly believes that the problem with the current exception is that it has
been interpreted too narrowly and fails to encompass acts of legitimate private
copying undertaken by consumers. BEUC calls for a clear and sufficiently broad
definition of the private copying exception to encompass acts of legitimate private
copying to ensure legal certainty, such an exception should be declared mandatory.

Such a right shall encompass acts of private copying that cause no or only minimal
economic harm to right holders. BEUC has identified a number of private copying
acts which only cause minimal harm:

        Format conversion and interoperability
Consumers make copies to secure interoperability by converting the file to another
format or simply transfer the file from one piece of hardware to another, typically
from a Personal Computer to a portable player. It would not be fair to expect
consumers to buy the same album several times just to be able to use and listen to
it on different devices. Consequently, there is no economic harm to creators and
rights holders and no compensation should be due. Consumers should not be held
liable for the lack of interoperability.

According to a market research carried out by the UK consumer association Which?
conducted a market research in September 2013. Six in ten people (63%) believe
that they should be able to copy copyrighted works for personal use. This is an
increase from 2010 when Consumer Focus research reported that 57% of people
agreed with having the right to copy copyrighted works for personal use. Of
significance, four in ten people (42%) actually assume that the price paid for
copyrighted material (e.g. a CD) includes ‘permission’ to make private copies to
another format.     More than half of people (56%) think ‘the price I pay for
copyrighted material should include permission to make private copies to another
format.

       Compilations
Consumers reproduce copyrighted material to make compilations with different
songs and artists. Similar compilations would only cause damage to creators and
rights holders if the same compilation was already in the market. However, more
often than not, private copies do not compete with copies sold or licensed on the
market, as consumers make compilations of the best of their own collection of
copyrighted music. This practice is not in competition with the sale of CDs and
therefore does not cause significant economic harm to right holders.

       Media used for computer back-up or private storage purposes
Consumers may use devices, such as USB keys or memory cards to store and save
information. This is the case with back-up copies consumers make of content carried
on their computers and personal servers in order to protect themselves from loss of
their data in case of a computer breakdown. The primary purpose of back-up
copying is to make copies of works purchased by copyright users in case the original
copy is lost or damaged.

Furthermore, BEUC is concerned about the efforts by rights holders to increase the
total amount of copyright levies to compensate for the alleged losses of their
revenues due to unauthorised use of copyright-protected material. BEUC would like
to stress that the payment of fair compensation is only due when consumers copy
legally and is not intended to compensate right holders for acts of illegal copying. It

                                                                                    42
goes without saying that fair compensation cannot be due for copies deriving from
unauthorised reproduction and distribution. There is only a claim to compensation in
connection with private copying, provided that such copying is permitted according
to the copyright laws of the Member States6

Significant legal uncertainty arises from the fact that the Information Society
Directive does not address the question of whether the private copying exception
can be overridden contractually. Most often, content is licensed to consumers
through click-through or click-wrap agreements that impose restrictions on the use
of content (i.e. prohibition of copies) they have legally purchased. Contractual terms
that impose use restrictions that go beyond the rights granted under copyright
legislation raise doubts as to their fairness. Furthermore, consumers are not
provided with the necessary information regarding possible use restrictions at a pre-
contractual stage and therefore their ability to make an informed choice is limited.
Use restrictions can also be due to the application of technical protection measures.

Similar use restrictions may be contrary to consumers’ expectations and grant
additional monopoly rents to right holders after the purchase of the content by the
consumer. The Copyright Directive fails to immunise the permitted uses of
copyrighted content against restrictions imposed by such contractual agreements.

BEUC therefore calls on the European Commission to consider a revision of the
current framework with the aim of immunising copyright exceptions, particularly the
private copying exception, against restrictions imposed by contractual agreements,
specifically end-user licensing agreements, or technical protection measures


65.   Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the
harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies? 59


X NO – Please explain
In the digital environment, copyright works are increasingly being distributed
subject to contracts which define the conditions of use of legally purchased content.
In most cases, consumers will be granted the right to make a number of (licensed)
copies without payment to creators and rights holders. Recital 35 of the Copyright
Directive explicitly excludes fair compensation where the right holder has already
received some kind of payment, while the ECJ excludes copies carried out with the
permission of the author. No private copying compensation should be due when
private copying is permitted and governed by a digital download contract for content
downloaded from legitimate online services. If the consumer has to pay a fee for the
content, a copyright levy amounts to double payment.


The majority of business models for legal content, such as those based on
streaming, do not necessarily require consumer storage capacity in the terms of the
private copying exception and therefore applying levies on the basis of memory size
is unaligned with the manner in which music and audiovisual content is consumed.


 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
59

mediation on private copying and reprography levies


                                                                                                  43
Furthermore, cloud based services make it possible to measure authorised uses of
creative content allowing for precise, license-based remuneration of right owners.


BEUC calls for immediate EU action in order to reform the current systems of
copyright levies and launch as a matter of urgency a reflection as to alternative
systems of fair compensation.


66.   How would changes in levies with respect to the application to
online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for
instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the
development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
BEUC is concerned with the assumption that all technological developments
negatively impact right holders and that they need for be compensated for the
assumed losses arising from them. On the contrary, more user-friendly means of
accessing works can both encourage consumers to buy more content and boost
rightholders’ revenues.

The reasoning behind private copying levies is to compensate for alleged economic
losses. Introducing any levy should therefore be based on evidence that rightholders
suffer a loss. Recital 35 of the Copyright Directive explicitly excludes fair
compensation where the right holder has already received some kind of payment,
while the ECJ excludes copies carried out with the permission of the author. No
private copying compensation should be due when private copying is permitted and
governed by a digital download contract for content downloaded from legitimate
online services. If the consumer has to pay a fee for the content, a copyright levy
amounts to double payment


In light of the emergence of new business models based on licensing and the
availability of TPMss, it is not always possible to justify the application of copyright
levies, the objective of which is to compensate for acts of private copying which
cannot be controlled and compensated.


Furthermore, the private copying exception should be applied in a manner which
takes account of the availability and use of technological measures. Technical
Protection Measures (TPMs) are still widely deployed allowing right holders to
control the copies made within the private sphere. TPMs raise a number of concerns
from the consumer point of view, in terms of access to content and interoperability.
However, they enable the control and restriction of private copying.


67.    Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the
invoices for products subject to levies?60
X YES – Please explain


 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
60

mediation on private copying and reprography levies.


                                                                                                  44
BEUC calls for a visible fee, with a clear breakdown of the copyright levy rate, to be
indicated on the invoice at all stages of the supply chain and to be clearly indicated
to the consumer. A visible fee should be displayed on the receipt, the price label in a
shop and also on websites and electronic commerce platforms. Consumers have an
undeniable right to know what they pay for, for what purposes and how the money
is distributed to the creators.


The mandatory introduction of a visible fee throughout the supply chain will improve
the transparency of the copyright levies system, raise consumer awareness and
improve compliance.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This
results in obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single
Market. At the same time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate
application of private copying levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to
whom the product subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In that
context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption and/or ex post
reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the
number of undue payments61.

68.    Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy,
or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?


X YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the
undue payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post
reimbursement schemes could help to remedy the situation.


The current obligation upon manufacturers of having to pay the levy in the country
of import and then requesting a refund in the country of origin makes cross-border
trade more difficult than domestic transactions. The processing of having to pay the
levy in the country of destination and then request a refund in the country of origin
discriminates against imports as opposed to products sold domestically.
Furthermore, the national refund systems vary significantly as well as the
administrative arrangements necessary to obtain refunds.


The current system constitutes a major obstacle to the development of cross border
e-Commerce. In many cases, consumers are restricted from purchasing a range of
products from another country due to claims by a collecting society for payment of a
levy in the country of residence of the consumer, for products on which a levy in the
country of the seller has already been paid. Such a system amounts to double
payment.




 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the
61

mediation on private copying and reprography levies.


                                                                                                  45
BEUC contends that copyright levies should only be applied once, where relevant,
when a product is first placed on the market in the EU and should then circulate
freely within the EU without additional copyright levies being applied. In order to
ensure right holders in the consumers’ country of residence receive the
compensation, a clearing mechanism must be established among collecting
societies.


69.    What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons
other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private
copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of
transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
The current system of copyright levies fails to distinguish between copies made by
private users and copies made by professional users. However, such indiscriminate
application on equipment, media and devices not made available to private users
and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying, is incompatible with
Directive 2001/29 as stated by the European Court of Justice in the Padawan case
C-467/08.


70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they
affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy
the situation?
[Open question]
N/A


71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]


BEUC strongly believes that the current system of copyright levies does not
correspond to the needs of the digital environment. They are detrimental to
consumers who have to bear the costs, while the divergence of national rules leads
to the fragmentation of the Single Market.


In the short term, BEUC supports a reform of the current system; however, in the
medium term there need to be alternative means of fair compensation.


BEUC calls for immediate EU action in order to address the following issues:


1. Clarification of the scope of private copying exceptions




                                                                                46
- Business and professional use: the indiscriminate application of levies on
equipment, media and devices clearly reserved for professional uses is incompatible
with Directive 2001/29.
- Unauthorised reproduction: the payment of fair compensation is only due in cases
of legitimate private copying, as permitted under the copyright laws of the Member
States.
- Licensed copies: no private copying compensation should be due when private
copying is governed by a digital download contract for content downloaded from
legitimate online services.
- No levies for works freely distributed: no private copying compensation should be
due if creators make their works freely available to users.


2. Definition of “actual use” of equipment and devices


To assess whether a levy shall apply, BEUC strongly advocates for the criterion of
‘actual use’ consumers make of each product. The European Court of Justice has
confirmed that a link is necessary between the application of the levy and the
deemed use of the appliance???? for the purpose of private copying.


3. Definition of “economic harm”


Fair compensation must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of the
harm caused to authors of protected works by the introduction of the private
copying exception Furthermore, when the harm is only minimal there should not be
a levy. The Copyright Directive refers to ‘fair compensation” which is different from
the notion of “equitable remuneration” which is based on the notion that authors
have a right to remuneration for each and every usage of their works.


4. Visible fee


BEUC calls for a visible fee, with a clear breakdown of the copyright levy rate, to be
indicated on the invoice at all stages of the supply chain and to be clearly indicated
to the consumer. A visible fee should be displayed on the receipt, the price label in a
shop and also on websites and electronic commerce platforms. Consumers have an
undeniable right to know what they pay for.




     V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of
exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in
phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law

                                                                                    47
governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers 62 or
determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is
created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an area that has been
traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant differences
in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately
remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many
consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly
shared along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue concerns
contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights,
buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some
stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve
their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.   [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and
performances?
[Open question]
The bulk of contracts between creators and publishers were signed before the
emergence of digital content distribution. Hence many contracts do not explicitly
cover digital royalties that would arise from, for example, a song being sold as a
single on iTunes. BEUC is concerned that the way in which new online streaming
services are licensed may circumvent the payment of digital royalties to artists and
hence contravene the aim to create a favourable environment in the digital world for
creators and right holders, by ensuring appropriate remuneration for their creative
works.


BEUC supports the introduction in copyright legislation of provisions intended to
protect creators from unfair contractual practices. For example, we support the
introduction of the ‘best seller” and the “use it or lose it” clauses in contracts
negotiated between authors and publishers.


The “use it or lose it” provision will enable authors who previously transferred or
assigned their rights to a publisher to recapture their rights, if the publisher has
failed to exploit the material.


The “best seller clause” would allow the author to renegotiate his contract to
increase his participation in the proceeds of exploitation. A similar clause already
exist in the law of few EU Member States, but generally only allows modification of
the contract where the author has been paid a lump sum disproportionate to the
revenues received by the producer. This provides a potential remedy for the author
who has signed a “buy out” contract and is therefore unable, on the basis of that
contract, to benefit from a big success of his or her work in the marketplace. This

clauses in contracts)?

you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

VI.          Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil
enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights.
The Commission has consulted broadly on this text 65. Concerns have been raised as
to whether some of its provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright
in the digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to
deal with the new challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the
internet; on the other hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the
right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot be contested that
enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the
infringed content is used for a commercial purpose 66. One means to do this could be
to clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 67. At the same time,
there could be clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data
protection for private users.

75.Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
   efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial
   purpose?


X NO – Please explain
BEUC considers any discussion on the revision of the current legal framework for
civil enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights as premature. The Directive
2004/48 has been implemented by Member States only recently and therefore the
feedback on its effectiveness remains limited as there has been little case law.

                                                                                                             49
BEUC is concerned with the exclusive focus of the European Commission on the
adoption of longer protection and stronger enforcement measures. With countless
new opportunities arising from the ways content is accessed and distributed, the
need to rethink the European legal framework has arisen with the aim of achieving a
fair balance between the different stakeholders, promoting innovation and cultural
diversity.


Whereas the European Commission has not undertaken any concrete measure to
revise the Copyright Directive 2001/29, it has been pushing for the revision of the
IPR enforcement Directive 2004/48. Despite the majority of stakeholders and the
massive participation of citizens rejecting any revision of the enforcement
framework, we are surprised to see questions about enforcement in a consultation
that deals with substantive copyright law.


Furthermore, the European Commission introduces a new notion, that of
“commercial purpose”. This notion does not appear in the text of the Directive,
which only refers to “commercial scale” infringements. However, the European
Commission has been reluctant in clarifying the term ‘commercial scale” thus
opening the door to disproportionate sanctions against individual consumers,
without considering the lack of commercial motive, intention or financial benefits.


Requesting stakeholders to take a view on this question, without clarification of the
notion of “commercial purpose” is misleading and inappropriate.


We would like to stress that the approach adopted by both the European
Commission and national governments vis-à-vis IPR enforcement has resulted in
eroding any public support for IPRs. The failure to distinguish between organised
criminal entities infringing IPR for profit and individual users engaging in file-sharing
for personal use, creates not only a problem of proportionality, but also raises a
problem of ethics.


Copyrighted works are both an output of intellectual creation and an indispensable
input to creativity. Copyright law needs to balance the incentive to create with
access to works. Strict copyright enforcement in the digital environment has the
potential to frustrate the objective of dissemination of creative works and restrict
consumers’ access.


The approach, supported by copyright owners, has resulted in creating a negative
attitude towards copyright among the general public, particularly young people. It
becomes synonymous with monopolies and strict enforcement. Moreover, in most
cases, consumers and citizens are not even aware of what copyright consists of and
they do not know what they can or cannot do with copyright protected content


The European Commission must adopt a balanced approach which is based on
independent and reliable evidence and will ensure individual users are not treated as
criminals, nor accused of the assumed economic losses of the content industry. As

                                                                                      50
noted above, the economic impact of the failure of the content industry to adapt
their business models to consumers’ expectations needs to be considered.


76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow
for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service
providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name
registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the
cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
BEUC is seriously concerned with the European Commission’s assessment that the
closer involvement of intermediaries, including Internet Service Providers, in the
fight against IPR infringements is the recommended way forward.


BEUC considers the current rules on liability as outlined in the e-Commerce Directive
and the IPRED to be proven as effective and should therefore be maintained. It is
crucial to ensure that the ‘mere conduit’ principle is safeguarded according to which
internet providers can only act upon specific order by a court. A simple warning by a
copyright owner that specific content is allegedly infringing copyright should never
be considered conclusive evidence entailing the liability of the internet provider.


BEUC is opposed to a wide interpretation of the provision on injunctions which would
require ISPs to monitor content and prevent infringements in the future. Such an
extensive interpretation conflicts with the prohibition of general monitoring as
outlined in Article 15 of the e-commerce Directive23 and should therefore be
rejected.


Mandating the enforcement of copyright by private entities runs contrary to the
fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. The Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union explicitly grants everyone the right to a
fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. The European
Court of Justice has explicitly affirmed the principle of effective judicial protection as
a general principle of Community law (Case C-432/05). The need to respect this
principle becomes even more important in the context of IPR enforcement cases,
which often involve complex legal analysis, making it impossible to ascertain prima
facie the infringing character of copyright protected content.


The active involvement of ISPs in the detection and enforcement of IPRs will require
the application of filtering technologies. BEUC believes that this should not be the
recommended solution. Firstly, filtering technologies are, by design, unable to
distinguish between authorised and unauthorised copyright protected content, public
domain works or content freely distributed by the author. Similarly, technical
measures may result in bandwidth reduction and the slowing down of traffic, thus
causing problems to the use of time-sensitive applications and interfering with the
neutrality of the network.




                                                                                       51
From an economic point of view, obliging ISPs to deploy such measures would
require a complete reconfiguration of their networks and an increase of their
operational costs, which will be passed on to consumers. As a result, ISPs and
consumers would have to bear the cost of protecting the private rights and business
models of the content industry.


The use of specific technologies, such as Deep Packet Inspection, whereby ISPs
inspect every bit of information passing over their networks, raises serious privacy
concerns and runs contrary to the fundamental right to the confidentiality of
communications.


77.   Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected
and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of
personal data?


X NO – Please explain


Article 3 of the Enforcement Directive refers to the principle of proportionality in the
enforcement of intellectual property rights. The rights of right holders must be
balanced with the rights of users, including the fundamental right to protection of
personal data, the right to privacy and the confidentiality of communications. The
European Court of Justice in the Promusicae case (Case C275/06) has ruled that EU
law does not oblige Member States to publicise personal details in order to
guarantee effective protection of the author's rights.


Identification of alleged infringers should only be permitted in line with the
European Charter and all of the conditions provided for in the IPR Enforcement
Directive. We call on the Commission to identify all Member States that are failing to
respect the safeguards and to launch infringement proceedings.


Personal information of online users must only be disclosed to public law
enforcement authorities. Disclosure of information about users to third parties is
incompatible with data protection rules. This includes the IP address, both static and
dynamic, which are personal data since a third party can easily discover the natural
person using the IP address. This view is shared by both the European Data
Protection Supervisor and the Article 29 Data Protection Working Group.


According to a study carried out by the European Commission regarding the
relationship between IPR Enforcement and Data Protection legislation in a number of
Member States.
• IP addresses are generally considered by Data Protection Authorities and national
courts to be personal;
• IP addresses are considered to be traffic data, which means they may only be
processed in a limited number of circumstances, for specific purposes and that


                                                                                     52
consent is required to process them for other purposes such as online copyright
enforcement;
• ISPs cannot store IP addresses for the specific purpose of online copyright
enforcement, with the exception of France wherein retention for the purpose of
making information available to the judicial authorities or HADOPI is possible;
• The processing of IP addresses by ISPs to pass on infringement warning notices is
generally prohibited or subject to strict restrictions;
• The general monitoring of P2P networks by right holders resulting in the creation
of a database of potential copyright infringers is usually prohibited.




VII.      A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the
copyright debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the
feasibility of such an objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally
harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There
would then be a single EU title instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this
as the only manner in which a truly Single Market for content protected by copyright
can be ensured, while others believe that the same objective can better be achieved
by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain degree of
flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and
exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for
enforcement?


X NO


BEUC welcomes the proposal to launch a reflection on the possible harmonisation of
copyright rules through the adoption of a European Copyright Regulation. The
Lisbon Treaty establishes the competence of the EU to put in place a harmonised EU
policy in the field of Intellectual Property Rights, including copyright . BEUC believes
that the long-term objective of harmonisation of copyright rules is worth exploring
and encourages the European Commission to launch a thorough discussion with all
relevant stakeholders with the aim of further exploring this possibility.


The advantages of the adoption of a European Copyright Regulation must be
carefully assessed. First of all, such a harmonisation will enable the establishment of
the Digital Single Market for content online, as it will put in place a truly harmonised
legal framework. Secondly, it will enhance legal certainty and transparency for right
owners and consumers alike and greatly reduce transaction and licensing costs
related to the clearance of rights. Thirdly, it will prevent the fragmentation of the
market along national borders seeking to secure extra revenues from national

                                                                                     53
licensing. Fourthly, a Regulation will give rights and limitations equal status and
could restore the necessary “delicate balance” between exclusive rights of copyright
owners and the rights of consumers.


However, BEUC is aware that the creation of a single European Copyright title, will
meet the resistance of Member States, given the impact on existing national
legislation. It is therefore essential that prior to engaging in such an exercise, two
points will need to be clarified:


• The impact on national copyrights
In case the Community Copyright co-exists with national copyrights, this may add
further burden to the current complexity of the rights’ clearance system. However, a
similar coexistence will ensure that commercial users that wish to offer pan
European content services can get a Europe-wide licenses, while local users that
focus on national markets can equally clear rights only for the countries of their
focus instead of getting wider but more expensive licenses. The role of regulatory
authorities, in particular competition authorities, will be crucial to ensure that this
dual system is not abused by collecting societies that will seek to maximise the
benefits from the co-existence of a national and a Community right on the same
work.


• The scope of harmonisation
However, a solution to the problems from the dual system of national and
Community copyright might be the clear definition of the areas of law to be fully
harmonised. In order to ensure the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the
Regulation should only regulate those aspects that are necessary for the
establishment of the Digital Single Market and which cannot be left to Member
States.


The primary focus should be on the current set of copyright exceptions and
limitations and the recognition of a clear set of users’ rights. These should include
those current limitations that are of direct interest to consumers, namely the private
copying exceptions, as well as those reflecting fundamental rights and freedoms.
The establishment of rights should become a central aspect of the European
copyright framework.

EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State
legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
