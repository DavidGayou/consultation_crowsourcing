I. Access to your content across Europe


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other  than  the
one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)





€ NO





€ NO OPINION





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.


[Open question]


I almost always grant multi-territorial licences, which is the rule  in  the
book publishing sector.


5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to  certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





€ NO





€ NO OPINION





7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain





€ NO – Please explain


This is not needed for the book publishing sector.





€ NO OPINION





8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations
– i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?





€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])







€ NO OPINION




9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right  have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an  author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or  not),
on your remuneration,  or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief[2])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





4. Download to own digital content


14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please  specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


E-books being re-sold  and  lend  under  an  exception  will  have  dramatic
consequence on the market and on the whole value-chain of literature.  There
is a reason why this can only be  done  for  the  distribution  of  physical
books that bears traces of time and use, which  is  not  the  case  with  e-
books.


I. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


We do not see any problems, as most of  the  important  exceptions  such  as
teaching, research, libraries or for disabled persons  are  present  in  all
legislations across Europe.


€ NO OPINION


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


This would not be compatible with the  respect  for  cultural  and  national
traditions   which   are   embedded   in   our   authors’   rights/copyright
legislations.


€ NO OPINION


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why








€ NO – Please explain why


The current wording is flexible enough.


€ NO OPINION



26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to








€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


As publisher we use exceptions such as the exception for quotation and  sell
the books across Europe and the rest of  the  world.  We  never  encountered
problems.


€ NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of  “fair
compensation”  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part   of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

It is crucial that exceptions are  remunerated.  If  made  cross-border,  we
need to decide who pays as this should not  lead  to  the  disappearance  of
compensations which are owed to authors and publishers for  undermining  the
commercial exploitation of our works.

Access to content in libraries and archives


Preservation and archiving

28. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Off-premises access to library collections



32.  (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

In Denmark there are negotiated agreements between libraries and  publishers
allowing for remote access to e-books.

Rights  holders  have  extended  collective  license  agreements  with  most
educational institutions through Copydan  that  allow  for  the  educational
institutions to make digital copies available to the students  on  a  remote
access basis.


E – lending


36. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


Since 2011 there have  been  negotiated  agreements  with  public  libraries
implying  that  basically  all  published  e-books  are  available  to   the
libraries and to the lenders on a remote access basis.

€ NO


€ NO OPINION



Teaching

42.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

Access is partly provided by our own commercial license schemes and partly
by very well-functioning extended collective licensing schemes through
Copydan that basically imply that all education institutions have the
access to make copies available both printed and digitally.



Research


47.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?


Copydan licenses with educational institutions supplement the licenses that
the institution can enter into directly with publishers concerning
periodicals and other scientific and research publications

Disabilities


50.  (c) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





52. What mechanisms exist in the market place  to  facilitate  accessibility
to content? How successful are they?


[Open question]


Thanks to ePub3, we manage to make many more e-books accessible. We have
published 12 e-pub3 books.





Text and data mining

53. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


When asked, publishers  are  giving  authorisation  to  genuine  and  honest
requests  coming  from  non-commercial  researchers.  We  provide  to   give
licences under standard terms and at no additional  costs.  Publishers  also
allow TDM for commercial players but this will be under different  licensing
terms.





€ NO OPINION


55. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

Supporting    STM    initiative    such    as    Cross    Ref’s    Prospect.
(http://www.crossref.org/).

57.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]


Setting up of a specific technical environment which you may not have
already (such as an API, where the researcher may download the content
before mining it, which is not cost-free). An exception will not be helpful
to manage technical issues.





User-generated content


58. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





€ NO


€ NO OPINION


59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing  works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?


€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


Our work benefits from the ISBN number. When we create a work based on pre-
existing work either we rely on the quotation or parody exception or we
clear the rights with the original rightholders. We have always proceeded
so and believe that no change in legislation is needed.





€ NO OPINION






II. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain why


There are already good provisions to ensure that contracts are balanced  and
not abusive. Contractual law is a national competence and we do not see  the
need to create a EU contractual law covering copyright contract.


€ NO OPINION



 III. Respect for rights

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


We are satisfied with the current legislation but this could be improved.


Websites infringing copyright can come across as  non-commercial  but  there
are many  elements  that  make  the  non-commercial  characteristic  dubious
(advertisement, loss in sales, etc).


€ NO – Please explain











€ NO OPINION


76. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
for sufficient involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

We would find it beneficial if  some  intermediaries  such  as  advertisers,
payment services, domain name registrars and search engine who benefit  from
pirate website and piracy in general would be encourage to cooperate more.


77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


Both should be respected, but one  should  not  take  over  the  other,  and
protection of private life and personal data should not prevent to  be  able
to enforce our intellectual property rights.





€ NO OPINION

-----------------------
[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[2] Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the  right
holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
