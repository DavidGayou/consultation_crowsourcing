     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework 23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term 15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
   YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type
of content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-
visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games,
applications and other software)
Yes. Examples of impossibilities to access cultural content – TV channels, movie platforms,
movie or music streaming services, etc. – from some EU countries are too frequent. Be it from
the point of view of the citizens, of the authors or of the businesses that provide a truncated
service, this situation is not acceptable.
Access to public broadcasting is restricted from neighbouring countries. Especially in
Germany the content provided is restricted by geo-blocks. The processes also delay arrival of
very common platforms such as netflix. On gaming consoles the services provided vary a lot
and some accounts cannot be carried over national borders, especially for streaming services.
Yes, in Germany, it was problematic to view content on Youtube due to GEMA restrictions.

2.     [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
We need a new, common copyright for Europe. Copyright needs to be reformed in Europe in
order to take into account the needs and changes of the digital era. This is necessary to the
proper functioning of the single market. It is in the interest of the development of new
business models and innovative businesses. And it is also essential to bring legal certainty to
economic actors, to facilitate the licensing of works of right holders and to legalize perfectly
legitimate actions from citizens accessing and using copyrighted material. Only a legislative
initiative               can                 achieve                these                 goals.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
Certain distribution platforms, such as Pirate bay are blocked in some countries denying
access to potential consumers for independent music and movie producers.
  NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

                                                                                              9
         – Please explain by giving examples

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


One can fear that an answer to this question be because fees are asked country by country,
instead of being asked as a package for the whole EU territory. Separate payments often lead
to unjustifiable expensive fees and possibly to territorial restrictions. This opens the same
problem as we currently have with roaming charges and an ongoing process on reducing such
costs.




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
Current uncertainty about availability and legal status of digital products within the European
Union hinder creativity and entrepreneurship to a large extent. New businesses strive with
fewer barriers and accessibility. Content creators need to be able to make their contents
available all over the union on whichever platform they choose to share on. The revision of
the copyright directive is an absolute necessity, together with the suppression of the directive
on data basis. First priorities are the harmonization of exceptions and limitations and the
elaboration of a legal framework that includes the flexibilities that are today indispensible and
that need to apply on the whole EU territory.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC 16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.

                                                                                                           10
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders 19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies 20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks 21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.         The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
  NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would
be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach23)

18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see

   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many

Especially the argument why contents need to be less available in neighbouring EU member
states is very unclear to young people. Especially in border regions young people see the
access to digital contents varying from themselves to their neighbours, within a couple of
100m. There is little rationale to this.

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief 24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no pan-European platform to make digital contents available. Either remuneration is
handled on the national level, which leads to possible content restrictions and monetarisation
burdens, or one has to use global platforms that yield comparatively low returns.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are

Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

copyright exception)
No, the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected by
copyright should not be subject to the authorization of the right holders, unless their contents
are put into abusive or propagandist context. Moreover, hyperlink should never be subject to
copyright law. The ability to freely link to resources is a key feature of the Internet and has to
be ensured.

No, because it would lead to drastic changes of the Internet, which would be disastrous. The
use of the Internet continuously requires that the users' computer temporarily copies elements
of content that appears on the screen. Requiring the authorisation of right-holders to view web
page would turn users into infringers.
Such an authorisation is simply not feasible due to the structure of the internet; a right-holder
would have to auto enable authorisation anyways and lose control or would put up heavy
barriers for content use, which had to be decided on a case by case basis. Also it stands in
stark contrast to the sharing culture on the internet, which grows so fast that an individual
authorisation is simply not an option. Contents online need to be considered as online and
share-able, a Copyright reform cannot start from an understanding of individual copies
floating through the web.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
Reselling games is impossible on all online platforms. Same for purchased mp3s and videos
on the major platforms. Often the service for these products is discontinued and the digital
copies are not available anymore and the customer loses all access to the purchased content.
Without a legally binding possibility to make a copy (for private, personal use) of the afore-
mentioned contents the user is not able to buy contents online but only renting his access to
them, therefore we need a European right for copying for personal use.



27
  See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

                                                                                                              14

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
Resale would break the exclusivity of the bond between service providers and customers,
opening the market for digital contents on a broader scale. It would re-empower the consumer
to receive ownership for their digital contents and transfer as well responsibility to ensure a
safe trading environment online against infringements.

C.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute 29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
An additional registration system, especially on EU level, makes only sense with general
changes on the copyright system. The registration system needs to incentivise users and offer
a clearly defined additional value to register their created contents by ensuring easy rights
management and public availability of that information, without adding contractual
obligations by rights holder agencies.
It is key to facilitate both the remuneration and the use of copyrighted material. The difficulty
to identify rights owner is too often a problem. The majority of the works concerned have
little or no commercial value, but since they are still covered by copyright, they cannot be
reused or distributed. Rights owners who want to continue to exercise their commercial
exclusivity on work they already produced should register them within 5 years.
As a transitional measure, from the adoption of this registration mechanism, and within a time
frame of 5 years after the production, registration of copyright work should be compulsory for
authors to enjoy commercial exclusivity.

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             15

     NO OPINION


16.       What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]
Such a system would greatly reduce the number of orphan works and facilitate diligent search,
while it would facilitate the licensing of works for which it is otherwise difficult to identify
the right-holder(s). Empower the content creators and limit the ties to rights holder agencies.


17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]


A lot of sensitivity needs to be put into the implementation of such a system. Too strong
enforcement mechanisms or a difficult registration can break the system and render it useless.
Another difficulty can be to ensure the identity of the creator, to avoid wrongful registrations.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


18.       What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
One of the most important incentives for authors to register would be that otherwise, after 5
years, they would not be able anymore to benefit from commercial exclusivity of the work
they produced. Another incentive for a lot of authors would be to be more easily identified
and thus remunerated for uses of their works. More generally many authors could appreciate
the      way      this     would        facilitate    licensing     of       their     work.

D.        How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The


31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Linked Content Coalition 33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
Interoperability is one of the core principles that should be promoted to support the common
market. A common permission database can harmonize the differences between right
enforcement agency principles in the union. Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
Over the last decades, the copyright protection time in the EU has been increased to 70 years
after death of the author. This is disproportionately long and does not serve its purpose: to
help authors to create and live from their work. Both the term of copyrights and neighbouring
rights should be shortened in order to facilitate and increase access to culture and to
knowledge and to nourish public domain, of which everybody benefits, including authors. At
least the term duration of copyright should not exceed the one required by the Berne
Convention, 50 years after the death of the author. A similar term should be applied to
neighbouring rights. Considering the changes in cultural goods production and distribution,
the Berne standards should be discussed and revised.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional 39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B") 40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
36
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                            18
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes. The single market and the need to legal certainty require all actors to face and even
playing field based on harmonized exceptions and limitations in the EU. Many of recent
successful online services make use of legitimate exceptions and limitations from copyright.
This is true for all users but in particular for cultural heritage institutions. All European
citizens should benefit from the same conditions to access to culture and knowledge. The
means for exceptions are to be the same in all countries. Flexibilities need to be harmonized.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes. All exceptions should be made mandatory for all EU countries and harmonized to the
maximum. The current list of exceptions and limitations allowed by directive 2001/29 is
insufficient and the exceptions should be adapted to the current reality, for instance by
including exceptions for remixing, for non-commercial sharing, the right to private copy,
private use and for data mining.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Exceptions for remixing, for non-commercial sharing by individuals and for text and data
mining and the right to private copy, private use should be added. However it should be made
clear that if the exceptions in the list are mandatory, the list in itself should not be considered
as exhaustive as imperative needs for new exception may emerge in the future.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
YES. Exceptions are very narrow and not necessarily adapted to the digital era.
Exceptions need a much higher degree of flexibility for free use for civil society and academic
use of contents, based on a legal footing to empower user groups to share contents. Copyright
enforcement on non-profit use should be strongly limited. NO – Please explain why

  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The EU needs to develop its own general framework for flexibility that can adapt to different
situations and needs, as not only protection and enforcement are important. The force of the
system also depends on the flexibilities it provides. For courts to make fast and fair
deliberations they need to be able to rely on a legal framework that offers enough room for
flexibility. Periodic revisions is not a realistic option: we already see how the difficulty to
reform the directives is a blocking and confusing factor for individuals as it is for important
sectors of the industry.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?

27.   In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
That is exactly the point why we need a European framework for it

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions 42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]

By harmonizing the scope of the exceptions defined by article 5(2)c and article 5(3)n of the
copyright directive and making them mandatory for all EU countries. The exception of article
5(2)c should be broadened in order to allow digitalisation of collections, and not just "specific
acts of reproduction". The exception under article 5(3)n should be extended to allow
electronic communication to the public.
30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]

The most important element is the broadening of article 5(2)c and article 5(3)n and the fact
that they become mandatory in all EU countries. Activities that should be covered in priority
are those of libraries, museums, archives and other educational institutions serving a public
interest mission. Reproduction should not serve commercial uses.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in


                                                                                              22
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
The problem in consulting works is not only cross border. It is for citizens to access online
works from the collections of libraries, museums, archives or other publicly funded
institutions. These institutions can indeed only rely on an existing exception in article 5(3)n of
the copyright directive allowing them to make works in their collections available "for the
purpose of research or private study, to individual members of the public by dedicated
terminals on the premises".
Several providers, as well as Member States block in their administrations, public WiFi put up
systems to prevent tunnelling, which is a necessity to access university contents remotely.
Tunnelling also facilitates secure communication and should in no way be hindered for the
users.

34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under

The best way to solve this problem would be to broaden the exception of article 5(3)n of the
copyright directive and to make it an exception mandatory to all EU countries.

[Open question]
Please see the previous answer.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different


                                                                                               23
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
Yes. Libraries face numerous problems when trying to negotiate licenses with publishers and
other rightholders; particularly in the case of multiple licenses. The fact that they have to
negociate specific licenses for e-lending in itself is problematic. The fact that rightholders
remove unilaterally works from what is accessible, thus changing the terms of the deal, is a
serious problem.
From the point of view of users, the same way people can access a book by borrowing in a
library, they should be able to access its digital version for a period, whether it is in their
country or in another European state. Today’s reality is very different from that.
  NO
  NO OPINION

37.   If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


The best way to solve this problem would be a regulatory solution, here again by to
broadening the exception of article 5(3)n of the copyright directive and establish an exception
for educational and scientific use mandatory to all EU countries that would make it possible
for librairies to make works accessible on line.
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
One of the big difference and big difficulty for institutional users is the negotiation of licences
and licence terms with publishers. Libraries, and particularly the ones that are not part of big
institutions, are often in a very weak position and are forced to access unfair deals. The
oligopolistic context that prevails in too many domains is a serious problem.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?

                                                                                                24
[Open question]

Lack of a monetarisation possibility once content is provided, not very appealing to
independent actors
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other 44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The 2011 MoU is insufficient to address the issue of mass digitization (the extremely limited
number of projects making use of the MoU is a clear indication of this inadaptation).
An extension of the scope of the exception of article 5(3)n of the copyright directive is a more
realistic way of dealing with this issue.

44
          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             25

41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
Yes. The extension of the exception of article 5(3)n of the copyright directive should apply to
all type of works and thus be of use to all publicly accessible libraries, museums or archives
in Europe.
     NO – Please explain

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
In many European countries there is currently legal uncertainty on the use of digital work for
teaching purposes. This is due to differences and narrow implementations of the existing
exception for teaching in the copyright directive in national laws.
Due to excessive costs many materials are not available in sufficient amount in university
libraries and schools. Often teachers and lecturers have to resort to offering copies, which try
to circumvent the national copyright restrictions. A more coherent approach, making
education more accessible for students of lesser wealth is needed.

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The current educational exception should clearly apply to all works available on line and be
made mandatory in all EU countries.
44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
There are extended collective licensing agreements with collective management organizations
or rightholders in several countries in Europe. These agreements do not cover all situations,
all teachers or institutions in need of using work for educational purposes, or impose limiting
conditions. Cross countries use is also a problem in this context.
45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
An educational exception covering all types of works (text, photo, film, multimedia, etc.) for
illustration for teaching purposes should become mandatory to all EU member States. It
should benefit to public as well as private educational establishment and cover classrooms
teaching as well as distance education. It should not limit the length of excerpts from works
that can be used.

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

Not all EU Member States have implemented an exception for research, which is a problem.
Research works and data are often protected by licences or not accessible, which for instance
contradicts the rules of open access that the EU is promoting in the context of Horizon 2020.
This situation is aggravated by the oligopolistic structure of the academic publishing business.
     NO
     NO OPINION


48.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The research exception should apply to both non commercial and commercial research. It
should also cover cross boarder movements of researchers (students, as well as researchers
and professors). Open access policies should be promoted more actively in Europe.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Licensing mechanisms often prove to be unsatisfactory due to the imbalance in power relation
between the rightholders and the research institutions.

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,

     YES – Please explain by giving examples
Cross boarder shipment or exchange of protected reading content in accessible format among
persons with disabilities is still a problem within Europe.
Interoperability of services is not granted leading to loss of functions to help with assisted
reading. A coherent standard to be applied on all internet accessing devices would help
greatly to facilitate the creation of content accommodating the needs of people with disability.
     NO
     NO OPINION


51.        If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
The ratification and implementation by the EU and its Member States of the WIPO
Marrakech Treaty should improve greatly the situation. This should be done as soon as
possible, without waiting for the reform of the copyright directive.
Grant an interoperability of all online services and file standards.
52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
Market mechanisms have proved unable to provide persons with disability with a reasonable
offer. On top of that, copyright protection, and the lack of the existence of an exception in all
countries across the world, further limits access to culture and knowledge for these
populations.
Conflicting digital rights management services and blocks hinder the development of
accessibility standards. A harmonisation of formats is an important step to the inclusion of
people with special needs.

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              29
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe” 52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
If data mining in itself is not directly impeded by copyright legislations, it often requires
copying content which falls under copyright protection before data can be extracted.
Explanation: Text and data mining covers the extraction of facts and data, which are not
covered by copyright. From a legal point of view, the problem is that text and data mining
may infringe copyright because it is necessary to make copies of content to convert it into
machine readable format. From a practical/technical point of view, technical protection
measures (TPMs) can prevent users from downloading content in order to ‘mine’ it. This
notably seriously impedes research.

[Open question]
By the introduction of a specific exception to copyright protection.


55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

The best way would be to an exception to copyright law, not limited to non-commercial
activities, as well as the removal of the data base directive.

[Open question]

Technical protection measures (TPMs) are also an issue preventing text and data mining,
which is why they must be banned.

F.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content

53
  A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

                                                                                                           31
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 54.

Even if remixes and mashups can be covered by an exception for parody purposes in several
EU members, generally, as end users, the sharing of remixes and mashups of works online,
even if only the parts of works re-used are very limited, is almost impossible legally under the
current EU copyright law, even for non-commercial uses. Clearing the rights of all the small
parts combined in a remix or a mashup would be disproportionately complicated and long,
and possibly expensive when the use is most of the time non commercial. The only option is
therefore to create in complete unlawfulness. NO

Clear explanations on how to properly reference copyrighted content and non-commercial use

If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements?
Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
Whatever the solution is, it should focus on an approach that empowers the user with
responsibility and not withholds user's rights and access.

62.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
In order to allow remixes, mashups and other transformative creation, and to avoid contractual
arrangements to further prevent their existence, legislative changes are necessary. There are
different ways to proceed: broadening the citation exception, using the parody exception or

                                                                                             33
creating a specific new exception. In any case an exception to copyright covering
transformative work should become mandatory in all Member States. This should apply
automatically to non commercial uses and could depend on cases that also cover commercial
uses when new creation corresponds to true original productions.



     IV.    Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

63.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
The current absence of harmonization of the private copying and reprography exception
among EU Member States creates legal uncertainty for individual uses as well as for business
models and lays the root for incoherent remuneration models. EU citizens should be able to
enjoy the same options and rights from one country to the other. Services should be able to
benefit from the same condition across Europe.

64.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
         – Please explain
This question mixes several issues. Citizens should be able to legally copy for private uses in
order to maintain their right to make use of the content in case the online platform
discontinues its support. This is an important right that needs to be secure independently of
the issue of private copying levies.
Regarding towards the rights-holder, the situation is complex, as the impact on rightholders
can be very diverse. If it can be negative on revenues, it is also often positive and opens new
ways of revenue.
When rightholders licence a service they easier do it in exchange of a financial contribution or
do not request payment, but in both cases it does not make sense to add the payment of a levy
on top of the conditions that they have set.
The payment of levies for the use of content that are not licensed already to users should in
any case correspond to cases where it can be demonstrated that there is an economic prejudice
to the rights-holder.

65.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
No new levy or tax should be developed without first a clear assessment of the already
existing taxes and levies and the revenues that they generate. Multiple copies can be taken
into account when releasing any content in the digital that is just basic internet structure.
Trying to monetize individual copies is ridiculous and unrealistic, especially considering the
technological limitations at hand. Models should much rather consider how to facilitate
unlimited access to a purchased content instead of looking into ways to charge for the same
content over and over again.
66.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

67.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
  YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement
schemes could help to remedy the situation.
Due to standardizes levies on usb drives in Germany and Austria I had to pay the same levy
twice for the same drive without taking into consideration the use of the device. For a while it
was not possible to order storage devices from Germany for exactly that reason. Whilst levies
can be a solution they must be coupled with consumer protection in response. Being double
charged to use a device without even accessing digital contents with it, for the potential use of
transferring digital contents, to compensate creators of contents in general does not seem
justified. In return users should get protection for the contents they use and security that net
neutrality standards are kept at a high level, to allow content distribution that would make

[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


70.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
The rational behind private copying levies is to compensate economic losses. The creation of
any levy or tax should be based on documented evidence that there is a real economic
prejudice to rightholders' revenues.
Problems of abuse of copyright by the imposition of irrelevant taxes of levies could be limited
by an increase transparency on the real economic impact of unauthorized uses of copyright
material, of redistribution of resources collected in the name of copyright or economic losses
suffered by rightholders.
Some levies currently existing are clearly abuse of rightholders' rights and the principle of
copyright. They are illegitimate and should not exist.
A levy argumentation based on the assumption of copyright infringement criminalizes all
users. This not only accuses all users of copyright infringement, it also puts a double
punishment on actual violators.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,

62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                            37
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

71.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The situation of authors/performers is a complex one. Most of them rely on mixed resources
to be able to create. Their situation could be improved in many different ways.
Copyright represents only one type of resources from which they benefit (and not all of them
benefit from it equally).
Contract law is a key domain in which authors/performers position is too weak and should be
reinforced. Especially in the context of the oligopolies that developed in the communication
and distribution industries.
Regarding copyright, the key aspect is that author's and performs do not lose too easily
control of their production, and benefit in a fair way from the resources generated by their
work. The issue of the distribution of the money collected in the name of copyright is the key
one.

Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose 66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure 67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

74.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Respect for copyright does not depend on enforcement means but on the credibility of the
whole system for the public. Enforcement measures too often encroach on civil liberties and
basic principle of justice.
What is needed are fair and affordable means of legally purchasing the copyrighted contents
and reasonable figures to value digital contents and its circulation.

75.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
66
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
67
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           39
The limitation of intermediaries’ liability is key to the functioning of the Internet and should
not be put in question. Enforcement should not be privatized. The same way the rule of law
should always apply.

76.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
The right of rightholders clearly has prevailed during the last decade to the detriment of the
right of public interest, the right of private life and the protection of personal data. Various
cases have shown deep intrusion into the private sphere of users, which have been
insufficiently prosecuted. Additionally many companies make their business decisions led by
copyright infringement monetisation. Cases like inviting users to share copyrighted material
and afterwards suing them, adding lost income, according to expected sales, to process value
and similar cases show that the enforcement framework clearly trades customer protection
and personal securities for business interests.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

77.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION


78.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]



                                                                                             40
Building knowledge based economy and a common market without a common copyright
system is doomed to fail. Creating common market for digital goods is a rather urgent project
in order for the economic integration to continue. Different legislation in Member States
should serve as good practice to create a harmonized framework, facilitating much needed
consumer protection and a diverse cultural breeding ground.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

79.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
The EU should explore the possibility of introducing a ban in the consumer rights legislation
on Technical Protection Measures/Digital Rights Management restrictions. In any cases
legislative measures should be put in place to limit TPM/DRM restrictions and to provide
consumers with information allowing them to avoid goods or services affected by
TPM/DRMs. Circumvention of TPMs/DRM must be authorized when they apply to works
belonging to the public domain or to rights created by exceptions and limitations. The use of
TPMs/DRM on works that belong to the public domain should be sanctioned. There should be
a mandatory obligation to disclose in a way that makes it obvious (on the packaging) to
consumers when buying an item that it is subject to TPMs/DRM and any kind of technical
limitations to its full use.
