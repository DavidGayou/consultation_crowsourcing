     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

The European digital music market has grown considerably in the past few years and
increased significantly in its variety. However, despite the progress of new business
models, online piracy remains the biggest obstacle to the development of legal digital
services. Unfair competition from illegal services makes it difficult for legal services to
break into countries rigged with unauthorised services and to develop their businesses in
those countries.

  NO OPINION


3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
Record companies are regularly asked and they regularly grant, directly or via collective
management organizations representing their rights, EU-wide cross-border licences, and
in some cases even world-wide licenses. Copyright is not an issue and record companies
encourage services to launch as soon as possible and in as many countries as possible.
However, practise shows that many digital platforms choose to roll out services on a
gradual country by country basis. Like any business, digital services need to manage
their growth. Commercial reasons related to e.g. trying out new business models, high
infrastructure costs, establishing local presence and local partnerships with ISPs and
advertisers and adapting to local legislation and distribution, reporting and payment
systems have to be taken into account. Also, a key factor for the success of online
services is the proximity to local consumers and adapting to their needs and tastes. Even
the biggest companies like Apple and Google have staggered their roll-outs and some
services only look to service specific national audiences.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
The services’ choice to roll-out on a country-by-country basis, as explained in our
response to Q3, is not due to copyright, but reflects the diversity of European culture
and markets. The fundamental problem – online piracy – should be addressed by
applying more efficient enforcement measures and remedies. See our responses to
Questions 75 and 76.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
Record companies make repertoire available in all markets where they have rights to do
so. The only reasons why rights might not be granted are if the companies do not hold
rights in certain countries. The fact that rights are territorially defined should not be
confused with territorial restrictions. As explained above, our companies license rights
on a multi-territory, sometimes worldwide, basis.
                                                                                            9
  NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
Not applicable – see our response to Question 5.
       – Please explain by giving examples

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
The availability of music content across the EU is already a reality, no additional steps
or legislative changes are necessary. The European copyright system is based on
territorial rights, but this does not preclude the licensing of rights on a pan-European
basis or the growth of legal services across Europe, as explained in our response to
Question 3 and as already proven by the current digital music services. Changing this
framework without clear evidence of the need to do so, and without proof of any actual
benefit to the market, would create major uncertainty and would prejudice the
continued growth and viability of digital services.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

16
   Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
17
   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined
Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see
however, adopting a different approach, Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

                                                                                                               11
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is no need to clarify the territorial scope of the “making available” right, which
derives from international treaties as well as European law. Our rights, including the
right of making available, are frequently licensed on a multi-territory basis, and we have
not encountered any practical difficulties due to possible differences existing in the
national rules on authorship/ownership or transfer of rights.
The introduction of a so-called “country-of-origin” principle or an
“exploitation/targeted public” principle in EU-wide legislation would risk interfering
with and compromising the enforcement of our member’s rights.

2.         Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

create problems for you?

problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
The provision of a hyperlink should, at least in certain circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the right holders. This was confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case
(C-466/12). It confirms that linking to copies that have been made available without the
permission of the right holders is not permissible. Further, linking that exposes
copyrighted material to a new public (e.g. outside the territory of the initial license)
should also fall within the exclusive rights of right holders.

Musiikkituottajat – IFPI Finland notes that there have also been a few cases at national
level dealing essentially with the question of liability of individuals and/or services
offering links to infringing content (for instance Finnish Supreme Court’s “Finreactor” -
case KKO:2010:47). It should be clear that when illegal content is delivered via links
that direct users to the content, the providers of such links are liable for copyright
infringement.
The CJEU judgement in the Svensson case and other cases at national level indicate that
a broad definition of the communication to the public right should be maintained.
Otherwise right holders may be deprived of remedies against these forms of piracy.


   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
Comment: the EU Copyright Directive Article 5.1 provides that no authorisation is
required for temporary reproduction (a) for transmission by an intermediary and (b)
for lawful use. Under this clear statement of law, protection has been given to the right
holders without inhibiting legitimate internet services.

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
                                                                                                14
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
In the recorded music sector, the consequences of enabling the resale of digital content
would have very harmful consequences for the entire music market.
Permitting the resale of digital content would inevitably result in reduced revenues for
authors, performers and producers, which consequently could make it increasingly
difficult for creators and producers to make a living or profit from the sale of original
content.
The impact of the resale of physical sound recordings has historically not caused
significant harm to the market for new recordings, partly because the quality of used
copies generally deteriorates with the passage of time.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need

27
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
29
    For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                              15
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
The creation of an EU registration system is unnecessary. Identifiers and information
about ownership and rights are subject to market-led solutions, where a business need
arises. A system imposed by legislation carries significant risks for the market, including
additional administrative burdens, added infrastructure and IT costs and potential
conflict with existing market solutions.

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed

30
  On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                             16
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The Commission should work with private sector to foster the establishment of industry
standards and allow market activity to shape developments around database
interoperability.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

the protection more in line with authors, who benefit from life +70 years protection.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"

may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-

orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Existing exceptions already provide a large degree of flexibility and are able to
accommodate new uses online. For the rest, we believe that licensing solutions are the
most flexible and fastest way to accommodate new digital uses, knowing that many of
these uses have a commercial impact. The music industry is open to looking at ways to
ensure that the market continues to deliver pragmatic solutions for the benefits of all
parties. For instance, our companies are licensing user-generated content (UGC), which
has significant commercial impact and value. As explained in our responses to Questions
58-63 on UGC, record companies license platforms directly and the licenses enable the
embedding of UGC by users on their own websites, blogs, etc. The introduction of a new
exception would only deprive creators from revenues, without benefiting end-users in
any way.
The case for introducing any new exceptions should be properly set out. The actual real
world problem such legislation seeks to address should be defined and the economic and
societal impact of the exception should be analysed.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Assuming that a particular act has effect in more than one country and is subject to an
exception that requires compensation, compensation arising from the harm suffered in
each country should be paid to the person or entity that holds the rights in that
particular country, and should be paid by the person whose acts caused the harm in that
country.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the

[Open question]
In our view, there is no need for exceptions or limitations, or for any extension of the
existing exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing
schemes should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can
be implemented and adapted faster than legislation.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.


                                                                                           22
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?

[Open question]
Licensing is the most optimal solution.

3.     E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
                                                                                             23
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
Unlicensed E-lending would provide users with totally substitutable services to
legitimate music services offered on the market, which would harm normal commercial
exploitation by our sector. A potential exception would have a far greater economic
impact than the traditional physical schemes. These activities should be dealt with by the
market and should be subject to licenses.
Moreover, as the EU legislation does not guarantee performers and producers of sound
recordings any protection – not even in the form of remuneration right – for the lending
of sound recordings, widening the exception with respect to sound recording rights
would be particularly unjustified and unfair.


  NO OPINION

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
There is no need for exceptions or limitations or for any extension of the existing
exceptions. If problems exist, negotiated solutions, such as new licensing schemes should
be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can be implemented
and adapted faster than legislation. An exception for E-lending in the field of music
would directly harm the legal market.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]

                                                                                             24
It should be pointed out that when libraries get into the business of making works
available online, they are starting to compete in the areas traditionally governed by the
market, and therefore there is much less justification for exceptions and limitations.

4.       Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties. There is no issue
with out-of-commerce recordings within the music industry. Unlike the case may be for
other types of content, music content is already widely digitised and made available
through numerous digital services.

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             25
41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

     NO – Please explain
Producers are able to license their content directly; no additional schemes or
mechanisms are needed.


     NO OPINION

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

There is no need for extension of any existing exceptions. We agree with the conclusions

     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                               26
the exception for teaching and research (art. 5.3(a)) is formulated so that it includes E-
learning. The Study points out that the issue is that some implemented national laws
show a restrictive transposition and diverging conditions. We agree with the opinion
expressed in the Study that the best option to address and solve the divergences would
be to require Member States to meet the aim of the exception, especially when it
concerns cross-border teaching and research (pp. 402-403 of the Study).

illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems

borders?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).


51
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              29
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

UGC accounts for a significant proportion of the content available on video streaming
platforms. The record industry actively licences UGC platforms that make available
new content based on sound recordings and music videos created by the record labels.
These licences are granted to the platforms themselves and provided on a cross-border
basis. They give (i) individual Internet users the right to use recorded music in UGC and
(ii) record companies the possibility to monetise their content by sharing some of the
proceeds obtained by the licensed platforms from advertisements that appear alongside
the UGC. Today, a platform such as YouTube is the third largest source of digital
revenues for our industry.
The licences given by the companies also enable the embedding of UGC by users on
their own blogs or websites, thereby extending the authorised uses beyond the platforms
themselves and creating a legal environment for consumers.

59.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:] Have you
experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created (on the basis of

Digital fingerprinting systems such as YouTube’s Content ID and Audible Magic’s
automated content recognition system are generally satisfactory for purposes of
identifying pre-existing phonograms or videos that are incorporated into UGC.
The technologies identified above in combination with licenses to UGC platforms ensure
that when UGC incorporating pre-existing phonograms is made available, the
underlying works are identified and the making available of the work is licensed.

61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As explained above, the use of UGC is solved by licensing online platforms. This
provides a legal environment for consumers who make UGC available online, while
enabling right holders to monetise their content.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
UGC is being handled successfully by licensing. An exception for UGC would be
unnecessary and highly prejudicial.

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
As we have explained, market-led solutions exist that enable the creation and
dissemination of UGC. Users who wish to disseminate UGC using pre-existing music
may do so by making their creations available through licensed platforms.


     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders

for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for clear exceptions for copyright and reprography. The
private copying exception is limited to individual, non-commercial uses. We are not
aware of problems resulting from national legislation or case-law relating to the actual
scope of the exception, except for the issue of legal source, which is going to be clarified
by the CJEU in the near future.


     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
          – Please explain
The music industry’s priority has always been to give licenses whenever possible.
However, today a large number of private copies continue to be made from CDs or from
online sources on digital devices and media such as mobile phones, smart phones, MP3
players and PCs for reasons such as format shifting or for the making of copies beyond
licensed uses. Fair compensation must be provided for copies made under such

circumstances as foreseen under Article 5(2)b of the EU Copyright Directive whenever a
private copying exception exists under national law.
Directive 2001/29/EC provides criteria for the application of fair compensation, some of
which have been further elaborated by the CJEU. The possible harm to the right
holders is only one of the possible criteria, which can be taken into account to evaluate
the level of fair compensation. In this context, harm includes the missed licensing
opportunities for the right holders when copies cannot be licensed. The Directive also
states (Recital 35) that no levies are due when the prejudice to the right holders would
be minimal. There is no need to clarify these points further in legislation.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We do not think that levies interfere with development of new online services, including
cloud services. In fact, large varieties of online services, some of which rely on cloud
technology, have been developed in the last years and new are still emerging.
The vast majority of cloud services involve the setting up of a database and the making
available of copies to consumers. These activities require a license from the right
holders, and such licences have been granted to services such as iTunes Match. Copies
made “in the cloud” with such services do not fall under the scope of private copying
and levies.
Conversely, we do not see how lower levies would have any positive impact on the
development of legal services. As explained above, a reduction of levies would only affect
the revenues of the right holders for copies resulting from situations where there is no
effective licensing option.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60
     YES – Please explain
The application of a visible levy can be left to voluntary practice or to national
legislation.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Levies are not an obstacle for the free movement of goods or services. We are not aware
of cases of double payments. EU countries have put in place systems of exemptions or
refund schemes in the case of export or transit of products subject to levies.
The “Opus” judgment of the CJEU (case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs Opus
Supplies, 16 June 2011) recently clarified that, in cases of distant sales occurring from
one EU Member State to consumers located in another EU Member State, where a
private copying exception and levies are in place, the distant seller should be liable for
the payment of the levy applicable in the Member State where the consumer is located.
Consequently, it is for the State where right holders suffer from the harm caused by
private copying to ensure the effective recovery of the levy, irrespectively of whether the
media retailer is established in the same State or not.
This decision confirmed what is already applied in the offline environment. In our view,
the export or exemption schemes can also be applied in the case of online sales of
equipment and devices in order to avoid any possible double payments.
     NO OPINION

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions
result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of
products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]

61
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          36
The percentage of products sold to persons other than private individuals depends on
the type of product in question. However, it is important to point out that the relevant
criterion to assess the private nature of a copy is not the status of the person or entity
buying the product, but the actual nature of the use, as a product bought by a company
(such as smartphone, or tablet) can be used to no small extent to copy protected content
for private purposes. The extent of private uses on multi-purpose devices can be assessed
by market studies.
Moreover, national levy systems include systems of exemptions or reimbursement for
certain categories of users, thereby avoiding undue payments.


70.    Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what
extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some
Member States help to remedy the situation?

system, how would these problems best be solved?

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
62
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
63
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           37
[Open question]
From the record producer perspective, the grant of exclusive rights is essential to enable
the producer to take the significant financial investment risk required in an industry
where the few successes finance a broader diversity of recordings. Furthermore, this
gives the producer the ability to enforce those rights against infringing parties.
The best measure the EU can take to ensure that authors, producers and performers are
properly remunerated is to tackle piracy. The remuneration of authors, performers and
producers has been devastated by piracy; sales of music have halved as a direct
consequence. In order to substantially increase revenue for performers and authors, the
EU needs to provide adequate legislation to enable producers and publishers, on behalf
of performers and authors, to fully tackle piracy.
Contractual freedom of all parties involved is and continues to be the best mechanism
for addressing remuneration of performers. The decline in revenue over the last few
years comes directly from the impact of piracy, not from the contractual relationship
between producer and performer.
The digital market has not yet offset the decline in physical sales caused by piracy, so
there is no additional revenue in the value chain.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
      – Please explain why
See the response to Question 72. There is no demonstrable need for action at EU level.
Existing EU and national law as well as judicial precedents already provide protection
against unfair contractual practices. Moreover, in the music sector, the best guarantee
for fair contractual practices is the competitive pressure resulting from the intense
competition that exists at every level of the music industry. This is reinforced by the fact
that with new digital production and distribution technologies, the barrier to enter the
market of music production is very low. As a result of this competitive environment,
there is no room for unfair practises.


  NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
We believe that under the prevailing conditions a system that guarantees contractual
freedom is the best means to achieve fairness and fair contractual practice. We do not
believe that detailed rules interfering with the parties’ freedom to contract or
introducing artificial restrictions upon the parties will benefit anyone, as they would
ultimately reduce the production of new creative content to the detriment of right
holders and consumers.
                                                                                         38
     VI.    Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
The enforcement of IP rights should be made more efficient on several points. Directive
2004/48/EC was an important first step towards harmonising measures and procedures
for civil enforcement in Europe. However, with the further rapid development of
Internet technology, the Directive has now become inadequate to address the main
forms of copyright infringement online – which in the majority of cases involve a cross-
border element as Internet sites are available in more than one country – and it does not
provide effective remedies for right holders.
Directive 2004/48/EC needs to be revised, in particular with respect to the following
aspects:
- Cross-border injunctions should be allowed. One option is to allow an injunction against
a specific service obtained in one Member State to be enforced in another Member State,
either directly or by way of an expedited procedure.
- Article 8(3) of the Directive 2001/29/EC (which corresponds to Article 11 Directive
2004/48/EC) should be properly implemented in all European Member States.
- Provisions on damages as provided in the Directive 2004/48/EE should be improved to
achieve their purpose: (i) right holders have to be adequately compensated for the loss
suffered, and (ii) infringers (and other potential infringers) have to be deterred by
applying sufficiently significant damages.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The current legal framework is not clear enough in allowing for sufficient involvement
of intermediaries. The recording industry believes that all intermediaries such as
Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain
name registrars, etc. in the digital economy have a responsibility to cooperate in order to
support legitimate digital commerce and fight piracy. We therefore suggest improving
the following measures:

- Cooperation required from all intermediaries. For example, (a) search engines should
stop directing consumers to infringing content or services and in any event change their
prioritisation criteria (by promoting legal services and significantly demoting pirate sites
where a reasonable volume of infringement notices are sent); (b) advertisers/ad
networks should stop serving advertisements to infringing sites that make substantial
sums from unlicensed content; (c) payment providers should be required to stop
providing payment services to illegal sites and services; and (d) App stores should
remove Apps which are designed to facilitate piracy.

- Protection against liability only for truly neutral intermediaries. The most serious
problem right holders encounter with notice and action is that many of the platforms
and services seeking to take advantage of the safe harbours in Article 14 of Directive
2000/31/EC are not properly within the definition of hosting service providers, nor are
they true intermediaries (e.g. unlicensed locker services and BitTorrent sites). Many of
these services are structurally infringing sites, enabling the wide dissemination of
unauthorised content, and whose business model depends on right holders not being
able to locate and notify infringing URLs fast enough before they are re-posted.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
The balance between copyright enforcement and protection of private life and personal
data has been addressed extensively in case law (e.g. CJEU Promusicae case) and in
underlying legislation.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
We do not see what benefits a single EU Copyright Title would provide, and how it
could be put in practice.


  NO OPINION


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The core legal framework underlying the online music market, in particular Directive
2001/29/EC which sets out the necessary rights and the protection of technology in the
digital environment, is generally satisfactory, and is sufficiently harmonised at EU level.
It provides an acceptable degree of legal certainty as well as flexibility for the future.
Efforts should concentrate on the proper implementation and enforcement of this vital
framework.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

                                                                                           41
An immediate and positive impact on the copyright sectors would be to introduce a
system of tax credits to assist with the discovery, development and production costs of
new artists. A tax credit system would incentivise companies to take additional risks on
new European talent, it would boost cultural diversity and lead to more investment in
talent at a local level, all the while boosting the European economy.

Another important issue is to extend reduced VAT rates for the cultural sectors to cover
recorded music, which currently does not benefit from the reduced rates that other
sectors do. Additionally, extending the reduced VAT rates to both online and offline
products is important, as the product consumed is the same: music. Reduced and
harmonised VAT rates would lead to more consumer interest in purchasing music (at
lower prices) and would be a way of promoting Europe’s culture. It would also bring the
music sector in line with other creative and cultural sectors.
