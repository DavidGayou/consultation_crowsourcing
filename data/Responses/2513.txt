The Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) is the UK trade association for retailers and digital services offering music, video and games. Its membership embraces small independent record stores, supermarkets, specialist chains, internet retailers and digital operators download to own, rental and streaming services.

In 2013 UK entertainment retailers generated Pound5.3bn of consumer expenditure in the UK, of which Pound2.3bn was generated by digital products and services.

ERA's digital members include the likes of 24/7 Entertainment, 7digital, Amazon MP3,  Deezer, Google Play, Napster and Omnifone.

The majority of our members either operate across the European Union or would like to.

While ERA members do operate services offering video and games, this paper focuses on music since it is the sector which presents the most barriers in terms of complexity and inefficiency.

ERA's members regard difficulties with licensing music rights in the European Union to be the single greatest brake on their development.


Why it is important that digital services are licensed swiftly and efficiently?

Digital retailers and services make up one of the fastest-growing sectors in the music industry. Barely 10 years since the launch of the first successful services in the UK, digital music retailers and services generated 47.9% of consumer expenditure on recorded music in 2013.

UK consumer expenditure on digital music and services in 2013 amounted to Pound500.4m. It is important to note that the creation of this digital marketplace is entirely attributable to the drive and energy and investment of the digital retailers and services themselves.

The recorded music industry was historically slow to embrace the new digital services, insisting on digital rights management solutions, which hindered the creation of consumer friendly services.

It is now widely accepted that the availability of convenient, consumer-friendly digital services has been the single greatest contributor to reducing piracy and illegal downloading. 

To that extent the advent by ERA members of legal ways for UK music fans to enjoy digital music has been arguably the most important contributor to the health of the UK music industry of the past decade. Without the myriad of digital storefronts and streaming services created by UK retailers, the consumer market for recorded music could be as little as half of its current size.

Not only have digital retailers and services breathed new life into the music industry, directly benefiting artists and songwriters and their representatives, they have taken a comparatively small share of the revenues they have generated.

Digital music services typically pay 70% of their revenues to suppliers. Of the Pound500.4m in retail sales generated by digital music services and retailers in the UK in 2013, and after deducting around Pound83.4m in VAT, services passed around Pound292m to rights owners.

In total ERA estimates that digital services have generated over Pound1.5 billion in revenues over the past 10 years.

In other words, not only do new digital services provide rights owners the only viable alternative to piracy, they are also significant revenue generators, and rights owners are disproportionate beneficiaries of digital services' investment.

But digital services cannot expand and launch new and innovative services without the ability to license music easily and efficiently.


The current licensing landscape (Questions 2 and 4)


ERA's members believe the complexity and inefficiency of licensing in the European Union hinders competition, increases costs and acts to the detriment of creators and consumers.

This complexity and inefficiency puts digital services at a disadvantage to physical retailers who benefit from fewer restrictions and greater freedom.

Digital services believe it also creates a competitive disadvantage for European operators compared with their US competitors since US companies benefit from a single copyright framework to address a domestic market of 313m consumers, while European services must deal with 27 different jurisdictions to address their home market of 505m.

It is important to note that the US benefits from another advantage over European operators: download retailers are able to licence tracks for download with publishing rights already bundled in. We see no reason why this should not be extended to the Europe.

ERA's members believe that greater harmonisation of licensing  -  and the copyright framework which supports it  -  would unleash unprecedented growth in the European market for digital services to the benefit of creators, consumers and digital services alike.



Comparison with physical retailers (Questions 2 and 4)

On the whole the existing copyright framework works well for physical retailers.   When a retailer buys a CD from a record company supplier, all copyright licence fees are included in the trade price of the product, ie both the licence fee for the recording and the licence fee for the use of the songs embodied in the recording (the "mechanical copyright") are accounted for in a single transaction.

Once the retailer has bought the CD, he may then export it freely throughout the European Union, and consumers for their part may re-sell CDs they have bought.

In contrast ERA members offering digital music products and services face a dramatically more complicated, inefficient and restrictive business environment.


Licence fees (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

Instead of single payment for all copyright fees, digital services are obliged to account separately to the owners of the rights in the recording (typically a record label) and the rights in the songs embodied in the recording (typically a music publisher).

A further complication is that the publishing rights in the song further sub-divide into two separate rights  -  a mechanical right and a performance right, each of which may be represented by different parties.   Coupled with this is the apparent arbitrary division of publishing rights between mechanical and performance rights in different European territories.

In other words, every single recording which is offered for download or streaming is now subject to three separate negotiations, rather than the one (with the record company) which is standard in the physical world. With each of these three parties understandably keen to maximise their income, there is a constant pressure to increase payments, negatively affecting digital services's margins, their ability to attract capital and invest in long-term growth. Digital music business is, to the best of our knowledge, the only industry in which a retailer has to obtain completely three separate sets of permissions to sell each individual item of content.

In addition digital services are required to secure separate licences for each of the 27 territories in the European Union, and they are explicitly prevented from cross-border sales, ie a UK download store  -  unlike its physical counterpart - will be prevented from selling to consumers in Germany.

The result is that ERA members choosing to sell digitally face a business environment which is inherently more complex and more restrictive than that enjoyed by their physical competitors.


Recordings versus publishing  (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

The experience of ERA's members is that the problem of complexity in digital licensing is most apparent with regard to the licensing of songs rather than recordings.

To a great extent this is a beneficial result of consolidation in the recording industry. 

Between them the three "major" record companies  -  Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music  -  account for the vast majority of the music industry. In the UK these three companies accounted for 72% of the album market in 2013. In some EU territories the market is even more concentrated, with Universal Music itself accounting for 50% of the album market in Germany in 2013, following Universal's purchase of EMI in 2012.

Such aggregation of rights is potentially a challenge to digital services. It can certainly create a considerable imbalance in power in negotiations, but in the short term, it does mean that a small number of licence agreements account for a disproportionate share of the market and since all three "majors" are multinational operations, they are able in practice to provide one-stop European licensing.

This is not the case with the rights in songs controlled by music publishers for the following reasons:


Music publishing is inherently more complex than the recording business.  (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

While a record label will typically own 100% of the rights in a recording, an individual song may have a number of writers each represented by a different music publisher. To take an extreme example `Wings' by Little Mix, a UK Number One in 2012 listed 12 songwriters, each with their own publishing arrangements.


The music publishing business is more fragmented than the recordings business. (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

Not only do the leading players have a lower aggregate market share of around 67%, there is a far more established system of "sub-publishing", whereby publishers who operate in a single European territory license international rights on a territory-by-territory basis.

Third, while the majority of record company revenues arise out of direct relationships with licensees, a majority of music publishing revenues are paid via third party collection societies which operate solely on a national basis and with which licensees are obliged to deal.


There is a multiplicity of licensing points. (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

While the existence of national collection societies in principle might mean that digital services could have to deal with a maximum of 27 different (national) licensing points across the European Union, the selective withdrawal of Anglo-American mechanical rights by music publishers from collection societies means in practice digital services have to deal with both national and pan-European collecting societies. This means that in practice retailers wishing to operate digital music services across the EU have to deal with up to 36 different licensing points.

Importantly digital services have in practice no alternative but to strike deals with every significant publisher. In the case of recordings, where an individual company normally controls 100% of the rights in a specific work, services could theoretically operate without an agreement with a specific label. This is not the case with music publishing where the high incidence of songs written by multiple writers, each with different publishing arrangements, means it is almost impossible to operate without a comprehensive set of licences.


National territories define usages differently. (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

As noted above, digital music services must account for two different publishing rights, the mechanical right and the performance right, yet there is no agreement across the European Union as to the allocation of total publishing royalties between these two rights. Thus in the UK the publishing royalties on a download are attributed 75% to the mechanical right and 25% to the performance. However in Germany the attribution is 67% mechanical and 33% performance. In Switzerland it is 100% mechanical. There seems no good reason for this degree of variance and in the view of digital services is a result of national territories within the EU having too high a degree of discretion about the application of copyright law. 


Licensees often do not know which rights they control. (Questions 2,  4 and 10)

While digital services are obliged to seek licences both directly from music publishers and from collection societies for the use of song copyrights, very often it is unclear not just to the licensee, but also to the publisher and collection society precisely which rights they control. In part this is a reflection of the complexity of the music publishing industry and the relatively short terms of publishing contracts, but it is also, say digital services, a reflection of inefficiency and poor IT systems across the music publishing industry. 

Because neither publishers nor collection societies are currently able to identify precisely which rights they control, digital services are obliged to supply details of all music uses to all of their licensees who then proceed to claim the royalties they believe are owed to them. Invariably these claims add up to more than 100%, and further time and resource is expended resolving duplicate claims.

It is partly in response to this problem that publishers, collection societies and digital services are collaborating to create the proposed new Global Repertoire Database although progress has not been as quick as services would like, partly due to disputes over funding, and even when it is operational, it will not provide any solution to the underlying problems of licensing.


Impact on competition (Question 2)

ERA's members believe that taken together the impact of the problems outlined above is that new digital services spend a disproportionate amount of their time negotiating the complexities of licensing, rather than focusing on developing an attractive consumer proposition, ie the net result of the current licensing is that it reduces consumer choice hinders innovation and stifles competition. 

Launching a new digital music service in a single territory requires considerable investment in legal costs, which can be a significant barrier to new market entrants. One of the greatest benefits of digital technology  -  its ability to scale internationally  -  is constrained by the disproportionate effort required to reach terms across the European Union. There is no Single Market in music. This inevitably puts European operators at a disadvantage compared with their US counterparts who are able to address a domestic market of over 300m consumers through a single set of negotiations.
 With the increasing mobility of population and many people living and working across national borders digital services must be able to operate cross border. The current territorial licensingaffects not only competition and consumer choice, but also affects user experience for the most mobile consumers.  Many existing deals prevent a digital service in country A from serving consumer in Country B (except in some cases short periods to cater for a short-term trip).  Therefore a consumer who either moves permanently into another country or takes extended trip will have to be disconnected from the service under these terms or will have to change their subscription to the one based in Country B if their desired service is available in it.

ERA's Proposals  

A single music licensing process  (Question 4)

As outlined above, digital services are disadvantaged compared with their physical retail counterparts by the need to secure multiple licences for the same piece of music.  In the physical world, the publishing copyright payment is accounted for within the fee paid by the retailer to the record company.  

Digital services would like the same model to be extended to them, ie they would like publishing rights to be re-bundled in a combined music licensing process.

At the moment their view is that the music industry is effectively displacing the costs of inefficiencies within the digital music supply chain back on to the services. We believe this gives them no incentive to address those inefficiencies.

A single music licensing process would give the various players on the supply-side of the industry just such an incentive.

It is important to note that the current complexities of licensing do little to benefit creators: despite the fact that digital services are able to supply detailed logs of usages far more quickly than any physical retailer, the time required for songwriters and performers to be paid is no quicker and the commissions they may have to pay collection societies may even be higher than in the physical world.

It is important to note that the "one-stop-shop" licensing enjoyed by physical music retailers is the process prevailing in all other industries, including digital content distribution (e.g. movies or books, where all royalty payments are included into the price of a license with the movie studio or book publisher). 

To achieve this simplification of the process the EU could approach it by stipulating rates that are payable to the publishers or association, which would remove negotiation complexity and would make costs of running the business more transparent. Whether these payments are made directly to the publishers or via labels is less of a concern as it is complexity, length and unpredictability of negotiations that are of the highest concern. Interesting to note that this is broadly how US market operates.


Suggested actions on administrative inefficiencies 

While ERA's members believe that the major issues with music licensing in Europe are structural, there are also immediate practical steps we believe could be taken to improve current efficiencies.


Speed of response to licensing requests  (Question 4)

The monopoly power given to copyright owners means it is always a seller's market. The awareness on the part of copyright owners that effectively no service can operate without licensees from all licensors means there is often no urgency to strike deals. On the contrary there is little incentive to be the first to strike a deal since, there may be a financial premium attached to being the last copyright owner to strike a deal. This means response times to licensing requests are often very slow. This acts as brake on digital services' ability to innovate. ERA's members believe there should be an obligation on copyright owners to respond with a concrete proposal to licensing requests (ie more than a simple acknowledgement) within a reasonable time, say 60 days.

Because of the concentrated nature of the music business, the effective requirement to have licences from all players and therefore the potential premium to be gained from failing to agree terms, we believe the Commission should explore putting in place a mechanism to compel collective rights management organisations to grant rights at comparable terms when a set percentage of the market has done so, for instance rights owners with an aggregate 70% of the market.

There is a precedent for this in US copyright law as it pertains to song sampling.

Disclosure  (Question 4)

It is often unclear precisely which rights collection societies in particular represent. We believe that significant rights owners or representatives should be strongly encouraged to make available publicly information on precisely which rights they represent. There is no reason for this to be a secret. In the case of collection societies which often enjoy monopoly rights by governmental decree, making such information available is a reasonable quid pro quo for the power they exercise.
Likewise collection societies often justify tariffs on the basis they are `market rate' however there is a lack of transparency as to whether that is really the case and it appears that once questioned most tariffs are open to negotiation. Given that collection societies operate with differing degrees of legislative approval/oversight the issue is that the tariffs may be taken at face value to be non-negotiable `quasi-government fees/licences' and new entrants to the market may not have the expertise/knowledge to negotiate. Collection societies should provide greater transparency and should notify parties that all tariffs are subject to commercial negotiation and are not government sanctioned (unless they are set by a copyright board etc).


Information requirements   (Question 4 and 10)

Reporting requirements by record companies are subject to far too much change far too frequently  -  one major label is renowned for the frequency with which it changes reporting requirements. This requires digital services to rebuild reports, which is time consuming and costly. 

ERA's members believe it should be possible to standardise reporting.


Global Repertoire Database (Question 4 and 10)

While the GRD in itself cannot improve the structure of licensing, we believe it can offer substantial efficiencies and, as a European initiative, could give the European content and digital industries a competitive advantage. Because of this we believe there is a strong argument for the GRD to receive central funding from the European Commission.


A single European copyright (Question 4 and 78)

ERA believes the existence of a single European copyright would create significant efficiencies to the benefit of both music creators and consumers  -  as well as digital services. It would remove the need for 27 different sets of negotiation across the European Union and it would lead to the creation of a single European market in content, allowing the EU to compete effectively with the scale benefits enjoyed by the US.

However whilst as a concept this seems appealing we understand the practical difficulties of such a significant reform  -  not least in dealing with legacy contracts and structures. For this reason any introduction of a single European copyright would probably have to be on an opt-in basis to begin with.  Regardless, it should remain a long-term priority.

In the meantime, digital services call on the European Commission to make greater harmonisation of copyright law and licensing procedure across the European Union a specific policy objective. A good place to start would be the apparently arbitrary division of publishing rights between mechanical and performance rights in different European territories as outlined above.
