   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


If I remember correctly, this happened to me when I tried  to  watch  a  BBC
documentary video online (only available in the UK).





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


Zero: since I publish my  works  under  Free  Software  licenses,  they  are
already available worldwide, so nobody needs to ask for it.


   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


If a right-holder does not provide adequate  forms  of  distribution,  allow
third parties to perform this distribution.





Note  that,  for  most  content,  such  secondary  distribution  is  already
happening, but at this moment it is still illegal.


   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


€ NO


   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ NO


I have created a multilingual website, and I find it justified  to  use  the
language settings, as supplied  by  the  browser  software  of  the  website
visitor, to redirect  the  visitor  to  a  page  in  his/her  own  language.
However, I did not find it necessary to restrict access: visitors can  still
override the default language selection by manually  selecting  any  of  the
other languages.


   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


When when cross-border availability is limited for the primary  distribution
channels, people are likely to create secondary  distribution  channels  for
each other, which  do  not  have  these  limitations  (read:  “illegal  file
sharing”). Since this secondary distribution is usually not  profitable  for
the right-holders, they already form a market  force  which  pushes  towards
primary  distribution  without  limitations  on  cross-border  availability.
Also, the  presence  of  secondary  distribution  channels  means  that,  in
practice, most content is already available cross-border.





However, this secondary distribution creates some problems too. Besides  the
fact that right-holders  no  longer  receive  the  income  they  might  have
expected from the primary distribution, it also  creates  large  numbers  of
people who break the law. Many  people  consider  cross-border  availability
restrictions to be unreasonable, so they don't consider it to  be  wrong  to
use secondary distribution channels when the primary ones are not  available
to  them.  Since  this  secondary  distribution  is   currently,   in   most
circumstances, illegal, this has the potential to create  large  numbers  of
people who have learned that it's sometimes OK to break the law.





To prevent this problem, I believe the best measure  would  be  to  legalize
this secondary distribution for all cases where  the  right-holders  do  not
create adequate primary distribution channels.  So,  for  instance,  when  a
right-holder makes content available in one EU country but not  in  another,
it should be legal for any third party to acquire the content in  the  first
EU country and distribute it in the second country.





Note that, with this measure, right-holders  who  distribute  simultaneously
in all EU countries (the “good guys”), still receive full protection.


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


1 [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


2 The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

€ NO –  The “targeting” approach is  subjective.  There  are  two  objective
criteria, the “country of origin” (the location  of  the  server,  which  is
operated  by  the  distributor,  and  which  distributes  a  work  over  the
internet), and the “country of destination” (the location of  the  receiving
party). The second criterium can only be used  if  the  distributor  gathers
reliable evidence of the “country of destination”, before  transmitting  the
work.

   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[23])?


€ NO OPINION


3 Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ NO


I release my works under Free Software licenses.  This  means  that  anybody
who accepts the terms of the license receives  the  rights  of  reproduction
and of making available (among other rights). Since it's usually trivial  to
conform to the terms of the license, it usually does not matter who  creates
reproductions and who makes available.


4 Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[24]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[25] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ NO – it should never be subject to authorisation of the right-holder.





First of all, it should not be subject to authorisation because a  hyperlink
to a work is simply not the work itself, so communicating a  hyperlink  does
not equal communicating the work itself. Publishing  the  title  of  a  book
does not equal publishing the book itself.





Secondly, a hyperlink to a work only allows people to  access  the  work  if
the work itself is made  available  at  the  location  where  the  hyperlink
points to. Therefore, if the hyperlink causes unauthorized  distribution  of
a work, this can still be stopped in an effective  way  by  prosecuting  the
party who makes the actual work available; it is not necessary to  prosecute
the party who makes the hyperlink available.





Finally, making a hyperlink subject to  authorisation  creates  a  dangerous
precedent, which could cause serious  damage  to  the  internet.  We  should
realize that the free  internet  is  much  more  valuable  to  society  than
copyright protection, so if we  have  to  choose  between  them,  we  should
choose to protect the internet. In this case, the danger  becomes  clear  if
we ask whether a hyperlink to a hyperlink to a work  should  be  subject  to
authorisation. If it should not, then it creates a  simple  work-around  for
people who want to create hyperlinks.  However,  if  it  should,  then  what
about  a hyperlink to a hyperlink to a hyperlink to  a  work?  In  the  end,
much of the internet could be subject to authorisation of large  numbers  of
right-holders.





As a clarification, compare this question to the question whether it  should
be illegal to be a friend of a criminal. If it  should,  then  shouldn't  it
also be illegal to  be  a  friend  of  a  friend  of  a  criminal?  And,  by
continuing this, who would dare to be friends  with  anyone,  if  such  laws
were in place?




  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ NO – if the right-holder makes a work available on a  web-page,  this  act
implies that he/she allows people to access the work. Since the  viewing  of
a web-page  implies  many  temporary  reproductions,  the  right-holder,  by
making the work available on a  web-page,  also  implicitly  authorizes  the
creation of these temporary  reproductions.  A  user  should  not  need  any
additional authorisation besides the implicit  authorisation  which  follows
from the fact that the work has been made available to him/her by the right-
holder or another authorized party.





Note that it may be impossible, and it is nearly  always  too  inconvenient,
for a website visitor to judge, prior to visiting a web  page,  whether  the
works on the web page are made available in an authorized way. Therefore,  a
website  visitor  should  not  be   held   liable   for   any   unauthorized
reproduction, which follows from visiting a website that was  created  in  a
non-authorized way.


5 Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[26].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[27].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION


  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


It would be good if producers of content have to compete with a  second-hand
market of copies of perfect quality. If the  availability  of  these  copies
means that people are no longer interested in the new content of  producers,
then the new content has apparently no added value  to  society.  Therefore,
the creation of such new content should not be rewarded.





Instead, the reward should go to content creators who  create  content  that
does have a higher value than the already-available content. In the  digital
world, content creation is only valuable to society  if  it  is  innovative:
replacement of old content is no longer  necessary.  Once  content  creators
stop being innovative, their content creation stops being valuable,  and  we
should stop rewarding them for it.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[28]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[29].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


It would create legal certainty, and as a result increase the effective
freedom of people to distribute, use, re-mix and share works which are not
registered, or works which are registered and released under a permissive
license.





Also it creates strong evidence, and hence also legal certainty, for right-
holders.


  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


Depending on how such a system is actually implemented, it could be
expensive or complicated to use it. In that case, the advantages would only
be available to large organisations, and not to consumers or small
producers. I would consider that to be a disadvantage.





Also, in practice, such a  system  might  not  work  as  good  as  intended.
Suppose I received a work of unknown origin, and I want to find out  whether
I am allowed to redistribute the work. So, I want to search for the work  in
the registration database. For a book that could  be  straight-forward:  the
contents can reliably be matched  with  the  registered  contents.  But  how
about movies or music? Even when just saving it with  different  compression
algorithms, the exact contents become slightly different, so it's no  longer
the same when a computer compares the two versions, but a human being  would
still consider the two to be the same work.


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


A very strong incentive would be if there were no copyright protection
without registration. The EU should strive for a change of international
treaties that forbid this. Note that the United States had a registration
model until 1989, so they can hardly argue that such a model is “wrong”.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[30], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[31]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[32]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[33] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[34]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ NO – They should be shorter. I don't believe there is any significant
public support for the current length of the copyright term. I think most
people expect copyright to expire in an “oversee-able” time.





Even when the copyright system is used to reward authors for their
creation, it should not be longer than is reasonably necessary to let
him/her collect most of the potential income from distribution of the work.
For many works, especially movies, music and software, most of the profit
is generated in the first few years. After these years, the copyright is of
limited value to the right-holder (which can be seen e.g. in decreasing
prices), but it becomes a huge burden to society. A large part of the
cultural works of the 20th century are still under copyright protection,
and especially for less popular works, this means that their availability
is very limited. Old copies can be hard to find, and the right-holder is
often no longer creating new copies. Besides creating a lack of
availability of culture, this also creates the danger of loss of culture.





On the other hand, there is a small number of works that continue to be
exploited for many decades. One example would be Disney-movies, which are
re-released every so-many years. I don't believe it is to the benefit of
society to reward such behavior. Instead of re-releasing old movies, Disney
should focus more on creating new, better movies, which are able to compete
with freely available copies of the old movies.





Putting everything together, I think the copyright term should be somewhere
between 5 and 20 years. This is consistent with research performed by Rufus
Pollock (University of Cambridge), who came to an optimal length of 15
years:


http://rufuspollock.org/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf





The EU should strive for change of international treaties, to make this
possible.

   I. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC[35].


Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[36].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[37], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[38],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.


In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[39].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


I consider the following exceptions to be necessary. Note that this list  is
not exhaustive: there may be exceptions I haven't thought of, but may  still
be necessary. So, any new exception mentioned  here  should  be  added,  but
there is no reason to remove existing exceptions.


* There should be an exception for redistribution  to  people  to  whom  the
right-holder is not distributing


* There should be an exception  for  redistribution  in  formats  which  the
right-holder does not  distribute,  if  those  formats  provide  significant
benefits.  For  instance,  these  could   be   formats   for   people   with
disabilities, or formats where DRM is  removed,  or  formats  which  can  be
viewed with Free Software, without acquiring patent licenses


* There should be an exception for use in education and scientific research


* There should be an exception for use in new works, e.g. “remixing”


* There should be an exception for making copies for personal use


* There should  be  an  exception  for  non-commercial  distribution  (“file
sharing”)

* There should be exceptions for small-scale and non-commercial  performance
and religious worship

Note that the need for exceptions shows that the general rules are  somewhat
wrong. It might be better to learn  from  the  exceptions,  and  change  the
general rules in such a way that less exceptions are needed.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Existing law, including copyright  law,  is  often  written  for  an
existing situation, and when a new situation emerges, for  instance  because
of new technologies, existing law often prohibits people  from  taking  full
advantage of the new opportunities in the new situation.

Since the world is rapidly changing, we need  to  have  the  flexibility  to
take advantage of new opportunities, while accepting that old  opportunities
may be lost in the process.
The current copyright framework prohibits people from taking full  advantage
of  the  data-sharing  capabilities  of  the  internet.  The  framework  for
limitations  and  exceptions  could  be  a   method  for  allowing   greater
flexibility for EU members to adapt to new situations.
  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

In a similar way as China allows certain regions  to  experiment  with  more
capitalism, the  EU  could  allow  its  member  states  to  experiment  with
exceptions  to  copyright  protection.  Any  rights  acquired  through  such
country-specific exceptions  should  not  be  valid  EU-wide,  although  EU-
countries which decide to use the same exceptions should be able  to  accept
exception rights acquired in the other country.


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[40] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[41].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[42].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1 Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


  28. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when  trying  to  use  an  exception  to
      preserve and archive specific works or other subject  matter  in  your
      collection?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in

In my view, it should be allowed for libraries, educational  establishments,
museum and archives to take sufficient measures, including digitisation  and
copying,  to  preserve  works  and   public   access   to   works,   without
authorisation of right-holders. Public lending  should  be  allowed  without
authorisation of right-holders; however, if  this  lending  happens  with  a
fee, then it may be required that a certain part of the fee is given to  the
right-holder.

2 Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

  32.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
      experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with
      rights holders that enable you to  provide  remote  access,  including
      across borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof)  for  purposes
      of research and private study?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including  across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections  of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of  the
institutions in question?


(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

I once tried to write a scientific paper about a discovery I made, but to
do this, I had to find out what has already been written about the subject.
Since I am not connected to any university, I experienced problems when
trying to access scientific papers. From what I understand, these papers
are accessible from university computer networks.


  33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Copyright law should be such that universities and libraries can provide
public access to scientific publications and scientific data without
authorisation of right-holders. If these institutions require a fee for
this access, they may be required to return a certain percentage of that
fee to right-holders. However, the institutions should be free to choose
the size of the fee (if any); government-funded institutions should be
encouraged to make the fee as low as possible (either zero, or just high
enough to cover distribution costs).

      its main elements? Which activities of  the  beneficiary  institutions
      should be covered and under which conditions?

3 E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

  36.  (a) [In particular if  you  are  a  library:]  Have  you  experienced
      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions

4 Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[43].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[44].


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?


€ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


Preservation of works and ensuring future accessibility  of  works  is  more
important than copyright protection. Copyright should  never  stand  in  the
way of preservation, independent of the location  of  right-holders  or  the
location of a collection.





  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual

€ YES – Please explain


Preservation of works and ensuring future accessibility  of  works  is  more
important than copyright protection. Copyright should  never  stand  in  the
way of preservation, independent of the type of content  or  the  medium  on
which the content is stored.


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including

€ YES – Please explain


I once tried to write a scientific paper about a discovery I  made,  but  to
do this, I had to find out what has already been written about the  subject.
Since I am not connected to any  university,  I  experienced  problems  when
trying to access scientific papers. From what  I  understand,  these  papers
are accessible from university computer networks.


Note that I still haven't published my discovery.

  48. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Copyright law should be such that universities  and  libraries  can  provide
public  access  to  scientific  publications  and  scientific  data  without
authorisation of right-holders. If these  institutions  require  a  fee  for
this access, they may be required to return a  certain  percentage  of  that
fee to right-holders. However, the institutions should  be  free  to  choose
the size of the fee  (if  any);  government-funded  institutions  should  be
encouraged to make the fee as low as possible (either  zero,  or  just  high
enough to cover distribution costs).

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [48].

The Marrakesh Treaty[49] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

There should  be  a  generic  copyright  exception,  which  allows,  without
authorization of the right-holder, for redistribution in formats  which  the
right-holder does not  distribute,  if  those  formats  provide  significant
benefits.  Among  other  things,  these  can   be   formats   that   improve
accessibility with respect to the original format(s).





Note that accessibility is just one  of  several  reasons  for  having  this
exception; this is why I formulated it in such a generic way. See answer  23
for some other reasons.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[50] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[51].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[52]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[53].


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?


(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


For obvious reasons I will not  give  any  specific  examples,  but  I  have
experienced several cases where I and/or other people created and  published
works based on pre-existing  works.  Typically,  these  were  non-commercial
productions, so there was no budget available for obtaining the  appropriate
licenses.





In my view, user-generated content is  flourishing  despite  copyright  law:
while many  UGC  works  contains  truly  creative  works,  they  are  often,
technically, violations of copyright law. It continues to  flourish  because
copyright enforcement is usually not very effective  and/or  because  right-
holders are afraid of loss of reputation if they  start  prosecuting  makers
of UGC.


  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?

  60. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right
      holder):] Have you experienced problems when trying to be  remunerated
      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?


(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


€ NO – Please explain


As a general rule, these works are of a non-commercial nature, so  there  is
no such thing as renumeration. Rewards  typically  consist  in  non-material
form (appreciation by other people) and in the ability to download  and  use
the free works of other people.





  61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


Copyright law should be such that use of pre-existing works in a  new  work,
and distribution of those new works is allowed without authorisation of  the
right-holders of the pre-existing works. There should be  a  norm  for  when
the new work is  sufficiently  different  from  the  pre-existing  works  to
consider it a new work. Note that  re-combination  of  (fragments  of)  pre-
existing  works  in  a  new  way  can  itself  be  a  significant   creative
expression, and it should be allowed to make and distribute such a  creative
expression without authorisation of the right-holders  of  the  pre-existing
works.





Also,  since  in  many  cases  UGC  is  of  a  non-commercial  nature,   and
distributed  for  free,  and  since  its  creators  are  often   not   (yet)
professional content producers, they often  do  not  have  access  to  legal
expertise. These people should be protected by simple rules. Such  a  simple
rule could be that, as long as you create, modify, copy and/or distribute  a
work without receiving any compensation (“do it for free”), you do not  need
any authorisation for doing so, independent of whether (or to  what  degree)
you use pre-existing works.


  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?


In copyright law,


* There should be an exception for use in new works, e.g. “remixing”


* There should  be  an  exception  for  non-commercial  distribution  (“file
sharing”)

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

   I. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[54]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[55][56].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  21. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[57]  in
      the digital environment?

  64. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?[58]

€ YES – Please explain


€ NO – Please explain


NO: In a society which respects the  privacy  of  its  citizens,  levies  on
digital copies of works can not be enforced effectively, since  the  act  of
making  copies  for  private  purposes  will  usually  remain  invisible  to
enforcers.


YES: instead of digital copies of works, digital  storage  media  should  be
subject to (small) levies. These can partially compensate right-holders  for
the fact that copyright often can not be  enforced  effectively,  and  often
should not be enforced (which should be reflected by various  exceptions  in
copyright law, including an exception for making private copies).

  65. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing   allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

As long as the levies are relatively small, and only applied on the sale  of
newly  produced(*)  storage  media,  most  business  models  should  not  be
significantly affected by those levies: the purchase of  new  storage  media
already result in a certain cost, and a small extra cost  will  not  make  a
large difference.





For business models which involve the copying of data, it  is  more  harmful
if levies are applied to the copying of data: copying of data  is  naturally
(almost) free, and (potential) business models which depend  on  this  could
become impossible if a “free” action is changed in a  “non-free”  action  by
such levies(**). The same is true  for  other  actions  which  are  (almost)
free, such as transferring of data (e.g. over the Internet).





For right-holders, these levies mean a  source  of  income  which  does  not
depend on hard-to-enforce copyright, and  which,  unlike  copyright,  has  a
minimal impact on the freedom of people and businesses. A major downside  is
that some authority has to decide  how  the  income  from  these  levies  is
distributed across artists and/or right-holders. One possibility is  to  use
a certain measure of popularity, but  there  might  be  alternative  models,
e.g. enable fans to make registered donations to artists, and  multiply  the
amount of these donations with the income from levies.





(*) or imported into the EU. The reason for  only  applying  levies  on  new
media is to not harm any business models which  depend  on  transferring  of
storage media between different parties.


(**) note: the same is true for copyright license fees, so  essentially  the
whole concept copyright can be considered  harmful  within  the  context  of
modern digital technology.

  66.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?[59]

€ YES – Please explain


It increases transparency. I do  not  see  why  this  should  be  compulsory
though: it is probably sufficient to allow sellers to add  this  information
to invoices.


Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[60].

  67. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

€ NO OPINION

  68. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please

      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

   I. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[61] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[62]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

  21. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

The best mechanisms are those which do  not  depend  on  license  fees  from
copyright  licensing,  since  copyright  usually   can   not   be   enforced
effectively. While there may be more mechanisms, I as a  software  developer
have used two such mechanisms:

* do not expect any remuneration: if “nothing” is sufficient for  you,  then
it is no problem when you receive nothing.  While  there  may  not  be  many
people as passionate as me who are prepared to create works  “for  nothing”,
their works can be copied an unlimited number of times,  so  the  few  might
actually be productive enough to “feed” the many with creative  works.  Note
that the creators who are prepared to “work for nothing” are often the  most
passionate ones, and since passion leads to practice and practice  leads  to
skill, these “free” works  can  often  be  of  the  best  quality.  See  for
instance the successes of open source software and Wikipedia.



*  Another  mechanism  is  to  receive  remuneration  for   a   non-copyable
performance. This is effectively the “businesses model” of people (like  me)
who develop software as an employee: salary in exchange for the  development
of new  software.  While  the  software  itself  is  copyable,  the  act  of
developing the software is not. The same is true for  live  performances  of
musicians: the music is copyable, but the performance is not.



Note that, in my case, the software I develop as an employee is so  specific
that it is only useful for my employer; any lack of copyright  (enforcement)
would not hit me or my employer. For more  general-purpose  software,  where
an employer could be financially dependent on copyright fees, the  situation
is different. However, even  for  general-purpose  software,  there  can  be
“business models” which do not  require  copyright  (enforcement).  Examples
are (commercial or non-commercial) open source software  development,  crowd
funding and governmental funding.
  71. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain


It may be worth considering to  make  copyright  a  non-transferable  right,
which always remains at the author. Employers, music labels etc. could  then
at most receive a license to make and distribute copies of a work.  However,
at this moment, I can not see the full impact of such a change.  Maybe  such
a change would not have any of the desired effects, if contracts  can  still
legally stop the author from exercising his/her copyright.

  72. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

   I. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[63] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[64].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[65]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[66].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  21. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

€ NO – Please explain


Efficiency sounds like something that no  reasonable  person  should  object
to, but  it  should  NEVER  lead  to  a  violation  of  fundamental  rights,
including the right of  free  and  private  communication.  A  violation  of
fundamental rights is not only immoral: it also leads to a further  decrease
in trust of the people in government and the  law,  which  might  indirectly
lead to an increase in crime and corruption.





This  is  not  a  matter  of  balance,  this  is  a  matter  of  priorities.
Fundamental rights are more important than copyright.

  73. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

Looking at the (seeming?) randomness of measures taken  against  the  Pirate
Bay website, I do not think the current legal framework is clear enough.



Intermediaries should have clear protections against being  forced  to  join
in a fight against copyright infringements. Especially intermediaries  which
services in an automated way, such  as  cloud  storage  providers,  internet
service providers, search engines and sites  which  allow  people  to  share
user-generated content, should receive strong protection: since there is  no
automated  way  of  distinguishing   copyright   infringements   from   non-
infringements, any blocking and/or  take-down  measures  would  destroy  the
automated nature of their businesses, leading to large amounts  of  economic
damage. Please note that such  automated  services  form  the  core  of  the
internet, so the internet as we know it today is at stake.



Also be aware that none of such measures, targeted at  intermediaries,  will
be successful in reducing infringements. As we have seen  in  the  past,  it
will  just  lead  to   a   further   decentralization,   where   centralized
intermediaries are not needed anymore. Also, it can  be  expected  that  the
use of strong encryption will increase.



Since the stability and efficiency of the internet is  more  important  than
an effective enforcement of  copyright,  and  since  attempts  at  copyright
enforcement will not be effective anyway, no measures should be taken  which
could undermine the stability and efficiency of the internet.
  74. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

€ NO – Please explain


It is my impression that, because of (among  other  things)  copyright,  the
fundamental rights of people, such as the  right  of  privacy  and  of  free
expression, are not sufficiently protected.

   I. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  21. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




  75. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

   I. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  21. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

The  use  of  DRM  (Digital  Rights  Management  or   Digital   Restrictions
Management) technology creates important problems. Through the  use  of  DRM
technology, publishers attempt to control, through  technological  measures,
what a consumer can and can not do with a copy of a work.

The  first  problem  with  this  approach  is  that  it   is   fundamentally
impossible: someone who has access to a work (which is  necessary  e.g.  for
reading a book or watching a movie) is always able to copy that  work  (e.g.
make photocopies of the book or record  the  movie).  This  is  not  just  a
theoretical possibility: in practice, all DRM methods are broken  sooner  or
later, and most are broken really soon (usually within a year). Even  if  it
is possible but difficult  to  break  a  DRM  method,  this  just  means  in
practice that some smart person considers it a challenge, manages  to  break
the DRM, and releases a DRM-free version to the rest of the world.  So,  the
first problem is that DRM creates a  false  promise  for  right-holders:  it
gives  them  the  false  impression  of  being  protected  against   illegal
reproduction, and because of this false impression, they are more likely  to
make the wrong businesses decisions.

The second problem is even more serious: DRM tends to  be  more  restrictive
than copyright law. This means that consumers who purchased a legal copy  of
a work will not be able to exercise all rights given to  them  by  copyright
law. The reason for this is that DRM technology can not distinguish  between
certain situations  which  are  different  from  a  legal  perspective.  For
instance, some jurisdictions allow people to make copies  for  private  use,
but not for distribution among other people. However, DRM can not “see”  the
purpose of the copying, so it will generally attempt to block all copying.

Another problem, especially with DRM that works by authentication  over  the
internet,  is  that  users'  rights  can  be  revoked  arbitrarily  by   the
distributor: you used to be able to access the work you purchased,  but  the
distributor decided at some point in time to no longer give  you  access  to
the work. An extreme example of this happened with  e-books  on  the  Amazon
Kindle:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amazon_Kindle&oldid=593768419#Rem
ote_content_removal
Ironically, this happened to the  books  1984  and  Animal  Farm  of  George
Orwell.
The reasons why a publisher would do this  can  be  various:  in  the  above
example, it actually had to do with incorrect  licensing  of  the  works  by
Amazon; in other cases it happened because a publisher simply stopped  their
authentication service.

Finally,  DRM  creates  a  compatibility  problem:   it   usually   requires
cooperation from the operating system and/or hardware of a device  to  block
a consumer from creating  DRM-free  copies,  and  it  usually  requires  the
makers of these operating systems and/or hardware to  keep  the  functioning
of the DRM-system secret. The result is  that  outsiders  are  not  free  to
create competing products which are compatible  with  the  DRM-system.  This
reduces free-market competition, and creates a barrier for  the  development
of open source software and/or hardware. An example of  this  would  be  the
problems faced by open source developers in creating DVD-playing software.

All this together creates the  counter-intuitive  situation  that  consumers
are actually better protected when  they  acquire  “pirated”  copies:  these
copies have their DRM removed, which allows consumers complete  freedom,  as
opposed  to  legitimate  copies,  which  restricts  them  to  whatever   the
publisher allows them to do.
http://xkcd.com/488/

Some music publishers, who have learned from  the  bad  reputation  and  bad
effectiveness of DRM-systems, have decided to no longer  put  DRM  on  their
works, in order not to alienate consumers from  them.  Maybe,  in  the  long
run, the market will solve the DRM-problem automatically for all media,  but
I am afraid this will take a long time. In the mean time,  it  would  be  of
great help if governments took an anti-DRM position.

A first step would be to  make  sure  that  people  can  legally  break  DRM
systems. At this moment, many countries have laws that make  it  illegal  to
break  copy  protection  measures.  These  laws  must  be  removed,  and  if
necessary, replaced  with  laws  which  explicitly  allow  this.  While  the
breaking of copy protection measures enables  people  to  violate  copyright
law, it is also necessary to enable them to exercise  all  rights  given  to
them by copyright law. The first case is  already  illegal,  so  no  further
rules are necessary  to  make  the  first  case  illegal.  The  second  case
justifies the breaking of DRM systems.

A further step would be to restrict the kind of DRM-systems a publisher  may
add to works which are sold commercially.  Ultimately,  consumers  would  be
best protected if all works have to be  sold  in  “open  standard”  formats,
which can be freely implemented by hardware/software developers without  any
royalties or signing  of  (non-disclosure)  agreements,  and  which  do  not
require any secret keys and/or remote authentication to be  able  to  access
the work. This should exclude all DRM systems.

of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
