   I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[1].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[2] should significantly facilitate the delivery of  multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for   online   services[3];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue  “Licences  for  Europe”[4]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[5].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[6].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level  in  the  medium  term[7]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established  by  Directive  2001/29/EC[8]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection  of  software[9]
and databases[10].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[11] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[12],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[13].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[14]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


€ YES

⎬ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[15])

It is not the territorial scope of the making available right only which  is
problematic, but the subject-matter thereof itself – see the  conception  of
the "making available" concept in the judgment of the Supreme Court  of  the
Czech                                                               Republic

1257B5C004F46EE?openDocument&Highlight=0   .   And   there    exist    other
conceptions (explanations) of the concept as  well.  Moreover,  the  related
question of the  "embedded  links"  lays  before  CJEU  (see  also  Part  3,
question 11). In view of  the  nature  of  "making  available"  act  and  of
transmission, which is integral to it, and which is,  in  fact,  an  act  of
global scope (unless limited by TPM, by the way of which it is possible,  in
a considerable degree, to give  effect  of  the  territorial  scope  of  the
particular licensing terms), it is possible  to  consider  reasonability  as
well as qualification of a use basing only on implementation  of  the  "fair
use" principle in the EU law.


The criteria "targeting" and "country  of  origin"  mentioned  above  cannot
have an absolute validity. They are meaningful  within  the  application  of
the "fair use" principle, only.

   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[16])?

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


⎬ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


It is desirable to add an explanation to a legal instrument  (a  recital  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC) that a  rightholder's  consent  is  requisite  for
each element of (established, stipulated) use  –  giving  examples  of  most
frequent cases of "complex use", which, in fact, require a set  of  consents
to a use (which is commonly perceived as a  single  one  –  as  eg.  "making
available").


(Qualification for making  reproduction  in  itself  does  not  bring  about
qualification for making available. On the  other  hand,  authorisation  for
making available without authorisation for making  appropriate  reproduction
is empty [ineffective].)


The said  explanation  (recital),  jointly  with  a  corresponding  part  of
explanatory memorandum, should guide, on the one hand,  rightholders  (their
agents) to granting licences comprising authorisations for both (or, as  the
case may be, more/all necessary) acts  –  and  the  licensees  to  requiring
licences in appropriate composition, as well as,  on  the  other  hand,  the
legislators, in the course of preparatory works  for  transposition  of  the
provision into the  national  legislation,  to  creating  appropriate  joint
provisions ("bundles") corresponding with the common kinds  of  uses.  (Eg.,
in the Copyright Act of the Czech Republic No. 121/2000 Coll.,  as  amended,
all provisions for  a  particular  kind  of  making  available  a  protected
subject-matter to the public, comprise both, or  as  a  case  may  be,  also
other relevant elements.)

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[17]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[18] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


€ YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


⎬ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)


With reservation to specific cases (see below),  we  consider  the  response
"NO" as the principal one. To provide a hypertext link (embedded link) to  a
resource that contains a protected subject-matter, should  not  primarily  -
as an act that, as such in itself alone, is not a use (quite frequently,  it
represents an  information  that  is  consumed  as  such  and  not  followed
further) - require consent of  the  rightholder.  (For  that  matter,  in  a
substantial majority  of  cases,  even  if  an  embedded  link  leads  to  a
protected  subject-matter,  a  following  use  thereof  by  a  person  which
followed the link neither ensues in any infringement nor  prejudices  it  in
any way the legitimate interests of the rightholder.)


A hypothetical answer "yes" should be limited  to  narrowly  specific  cases
when a hyperlink leads to  a  content  (protected  subject-matter)  that  is
communicated  to  the  public  (is,  technically,  accessible  to  anybody),
however in such a manner that it is not possible to search for and  find  it
in a usual way (by the way of using a searching machine): such a  source  is
accessible to such a person only that  has  at  his/her  disposal  an  exact
"address" (particular URL or similar unique locator). One can  assume,  with
a sufficient rate of general validity, that the embedded links of this  kind
are used either with a pre-existent  express  consent  of  rightholder  (ie.
particular in respect to the concrete use), or in cases of unlawful use.  It
is hardly productive to construct a need for a rightholder's consent in  the
latter case.


It follows, in view of cases when provision of embedded  links  inflicts  an
unreasonable prejudice to legitimate interest of rightholders (see also  the
case mentioned above to which the judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the
Czech            Republic            ref.            Tdo            137/2013

1257B5C004F46EE?openDocument&Highlight=0 as well  as  the  judgment  of  the
Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic ref. III.ÚS 1768/13  ze  dne  10.
9.    2013     http://nalus.usoud.cz/Search/GetText.aspx?sz=3-1768-13     is
related), a provision should be included into  a  legal  instrument  (or  an
official explanation) that it is impermissible to provide a link leading  to
a protected subject-matter if the use initiated  and  enabled  in  this  way
should conflict with the normal  exploitation  of  protected  subject-matter
and unreasonably prejudice the  legitimate  interests  of  the  rightholders
(the first step of the "Berne test" does not apply here).


Here as well, it is appropriate  to  introduce  the  "fair  use"  and  "fair
dealing" principles.

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

⎬ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,

covered by a copyright exception)


For consumption of protected subject-matter (ie. use  by  the  end-user  for
personal purposes [it need not be just a viewing, but also or  alternatively
listening to]) lawfully made available on the Internet (communicated to  the
public)  without  technical  protection  measures  (TPM),  there  should  an
express statutory provision that such a use  does  not  need  a  consent  of
rightholder.


On the other hand, it makes no sense to assume a  rightholder's  consent  to
consumption of protected subject-matter which is communicated to the  public
unlawfully. In respect to such cases, a procedure analogous to  the  "notice
– take down" (eg. "notice – close down") should be introduced. (If a  person
accesses a resource  containing  an  "illegal"  protected  subject-matter  a
notice to terminate the use of the content without a legal  title  would  be
displayed.)


Similarly, a statutory provision should enable establishments  mentioned  in
the  Directive  2001/29/EC  Art.  5/2(c)  to  use  protected  subject-matter
defined in the first paragraph in a context of providing public services.


The problems that lie in the basis of this  issue  (hardly  possible  to  be
tackeld in their full entirety) are caused  by  persisting  strictly  within
the framework of continental European author's law which is outlived in  the
digital era. In  particular  in  those  areas  where  the  law  attempts  to
"protect" economic rights of a rightholder also in such cases  and  elements
where the rightholder (the author) expressed definitely, by  the  way  of  a
conscious action, that he/she  does  not  want  to  utilize  the  respective
rights. As a solution, there are available the  principles  "fair  use"  and
"fair dealing" to be introduced into the EU legal framework, as well as  the
institute  of  registration  for  the  purpose  of  specific  categories  of
protection.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[19].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[20].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[21]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[22].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


⎬ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


The  system  would  facilitate,  in  a   substantial   degree,   getting   a
rightolder's consent in cases in which there exists real demand for  licence
(or the rightholder presupposes it) and the rightholder intends  to  utilize
his/her/its rights. Introduction of such a  system  would  be  advisable  to
combine with intensive information campaign for  using  open  licences  (eg.
like Creative Commons) in cases where the rightholder  does  not  intend  to
utilize the economic rights.


Indiscriminate requirement of  contemporary  (international)  copyright  law
that the protection of the right must not be  subject  to  any  registration
(in  general,  to  any  condition)  was  substantiated   in   the   analogue
environment with its limited communication capacity.  However,  we  live  in
the information society, where there exists immense capacity  of  collecting
information,  processing  it  and  making  it  available,  while  a  general
effective public access to  information  is  provided  for,  where,  in  the
social communication,  there  exist,  in  mass  extent,  protected  subject-
matters  of  those  rightholders  who  do  not  wish  any  copyright   based
regulation of their  own  production's  circulation,  who  do  not  want  to
utilize their nominal economic rights, while not wanting to care about  such
an issue altogether; such persons do not intend  to  claim  their  right  to
remuneration in any way.


Lack of record of a  subject-matter  in  the  system  would  not  result  in
impossibility to exercise moral rights (eg. using  a  work  in  dishonesting
way). However, registration of a  subject-matter  would  grant  title  to  a
higher level of protection of the economic rights.


Here it is appropriate to quote a recommendation of the Comité des sages  of
January 2011 (page 5): "Some form of registration should be considered as  a
precondition for a full exercise of rights. A  discussion  on  adapting  the
Berne Convention on this point in order to make it fit for the  digital  age
should be taken up in the context of  WIPO  and  promoted  by  the  European
Commission."

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


A certain degree of disadvantage: Such a system  could  hardly  contain  all
protected subject-matter. One can assume in a  reasonable  degree,  however,
that a substantial part of  subject-matters  for  which  there  would  exist
demand for consent to a new use (and for which  the  rightholders  would  be
readily available) would be registered  in  the  system  once  it  has  been
created.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


Possible  incentives  might  be  minimisation  (or,  as  the  case  may  be,
remission) of court fee in  respect  to  actions  on  infringing  rights  to
registered subject-matters. Stipulating for a  much  stricter  approach  and
deterrent to the cases of illegal commercial use of  a  registered  subject-
matter compared with the cases in respect to the unregistered ones.


Transition to such a system  would  have  to  be  accompanied  by  a  public
campaign making the rightholders aware of the need to register. It would  be
advisable to include  into  such  process  existing  systems  of  via  facti
registration of the  protected  subject-matters  on  national  level  (legal
deposit).


After all, even now the registration is a precondition  for  allocation  and
disbursement of amount in  respect  to  compensation  in  the  framework  of
obligatory collective management.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[23], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[24]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[25]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[26] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


The EU should create (or,  participate  in  creating  in  global  extent)  a
portal of all databases (both public and private ones)  with  a  metasearch-
machine. Search of such a machine would not return the full  information  on
rights that have not expired  themselves.  The  requesting  user  would  get
information  which  agency  or  collective  management  organisation   (CMO)
represents the respective rightholder and whom he/she/it should address  (as
the case may be, it might be a number of persons, should the result  of  the
search  suggest).  Metasearch  machines  would  provide  the  route  to  the
resource of the information – and enable display of such an  information  in
full extent  -  on  publications  (contents)  in  public  domain,  or,  more
generally, on subject-matters  that  are  not  protected  in  their  nature,
period of protection of which has  elapsed,  or  that  have  been  published
under an open licence, if available in the system.


For  the  function  of  metasearch  machine,  the   use   of   international
identifiers would be of great advantage.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[27]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


⎬ NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter


The term of  duration  of  economic  author's  rights,  70  years  from  the
author's death (or, as a case may be, that of  the  co-author  who  survived
the other ones) is unreasonably long a does not relate to the conditions  of
the digital era. The change by the way of  an  amendment  of  the  directive
2006/116/EC to stipulate for the term of duration of economic right  for  50
years from the death of author (ie. on the level of  the  Berne  Convention,
as amended) is quite attainable within EU procedures. A question may  arise,
whether a principle of  relating  the  benefit  of  the  protection  to  one
generation of heirs in a (future) reformed global system  of  the  copyright
(as compared with two generations, which is at  the  basis  of  the  present
legislation) would not correspond with the  social  attitudes  of  the  21st
century in a higher degree.

  II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[28].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[29].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[30], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[31],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[32].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

     21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and
         exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional
         for the Member States?

⎬ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


The problems consist, among others, in that,  quite  often,  people  do  not
take these legal phenomena (ie. technical, as well  as  not  just  technical
violation of the copyright provisions)  into consideration (also due to  the
fact, that, not in the latest, they are not commonly acted upon) – but  they
do exist nominally and create a state of  legal  uncertainty.  Some  of  the
cases: use  of  protected  subject  matters  in  e-learning  and  scientific
communication in a cross-border context as  well  as  in  the  framework  of
international inter-library services. In principal, however, these kinds  of
uses are perceived as lawful –  based  on  exceptions  from  copyright  (the
first two), international inter-library services are generally  anchored  in
the UNESCO materials (as an official inter-state organisation) and,  in  the
course of decades of their application have become a component part  of  the
custom law; partially, they are also  provided  for  by  a  recital  of  the
directive 2006/115/EC. The  uncertainty  impacts  upon  cooperation  in  the
framework of international projects.


An optimal solution might be anchoring the  exceptions  and  limitations  to
the copyright as  mandatory ones. A minimal solution might  provide  that  a
use of a protected subject-matter by the  establishments  mentioned  in  the
directive 2001/29/EC art. 5/2(c) in the cross-border context is governed  by
the law of the Member State in which the respective  use  originates  (where
the subject-matter is made available, the international library  service  is
provided).

well as for the purpose of replacement of an item lost or damaged,  for  the

     23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed
         from the  existing  catalogue?  Please  explain  by  referring  to
         specific cases.


[Open question]


No extant exceptions and limitations should be repealed, the  issue  of  the
uses that newly come into existence should be solved by an  open  provision,
in particular, by including principles of  "fair  use"  and  "fair  dealing"
(and, of a use of similar kind) – that not being to prejudice of  periodical
reviews and updating of the legislation.


Some instances of possible new exceptions and  limitations,  or  development
of the existing ones in the sense of their reasonable use in practice:


Even if, in our opinion, the authorisation to make a reproduction, in a non-
commercial context, of a subject-matter  lawfully  made  available  that  is
necessary  for  the  perception  of  the  content,  follows   from   present
legislation (ie., it  is  lawful  de  lege  lata),  there  is  a  need,  for
clarification and certainty in case of one of the commonest uses,  to  issue
an express and unambiguous provision stating that such an act does not  need
consent of the rightholder.


Making of reproductions by the establishments  mentioned  in  the  directive
2001/29/EC art. 5/2(c), eg. by the libraries, archives, museum, and, as  the
case may be, educational  establishments  (hereinafter  also,  respectively,
"LAM", or "LAME"), for  the  archiving  or  preservation  purposes,  in  the
extent and formats necessary for such  process  (ie.,  expressly,  including
reproductions  necessary  for  processing,  indexing,  change   of   format,
migration to another platform – while, at  the  same  time,  respecting  the
moral rights in the maximum degree attainable [in the meaning  of  retaining
the  substantial  features  of  the  representation  of   the   content   in
question]), including, namely, a  subject-matter  that  has  not  been  made
public (divulged) yet.


Making a reproduction by LAME of a  protected  subject-matter  contained  in
the LAME collection for the purpose of  making  available  on  terminals  on
site [see directive 2001/29/EC art. 5/3(n)] as well as making  it  available
in the stated way and, at the same time, such establishments of  the  public
sector or the establishments funded and  governed  by  the  registered  non-
profit-making corporations could benefit from this provision, in respect  to
out-of-commerce-works collectively, ie. they would  be  allowed  to  make  a
reproduction of one (well preserved) document from a collection  of  one  of
participating establishments and to share the reproduction  for  the  stated
kind of making available in all establishments that own  the  subject-matter
in their collections, or they owned it and has not divested of it.


Authorisation for LAM to make and supply a reproduction for the  purpose  of
use for teaching and in scientific research (in  the  latter  case  also  in
respect to the subject-matter not divulged yet) – ie.  from  this  provision
could  benefit  also  the  establishments  that  are  not  a  part  of   the
educational or research establishments for which the reproduction  would  be
made.


Authorisation for LAM to make and supply a reproduction to order of  a  user
if  the  user  produces  an  evidence  of  lawful  use  in  respect  to  the
reproduction in question.


Authorisation for libraries to make and supply to another library,  for  the
purpose of a provision of a service (reproduction  supply),  a  reproduction
of a small part of a  written  (textual)  work  (including  possible  images
included in such a work) or of a whole work of small extent or of an  image,
that authorisation applying both to the analogue and  digital  formats.  The
authorisation should  apply  in  the  cross-border  context  if  it  is  not
possible, with a reasonable effort, to find evidence on availability of  the
subject-matter on reasonable terms in the country of the  library  requiring
the  supply.  ("Reasonable  effort"  is  to  be  understood  as  search   in
catalogues of the national  library  and/or  library  association  that  are
accessible in a standard way.) The levy for compensation in respect  to  the
use shall be governed by the law of the country of  the  supplying  library.
Some limitations may apply, eg. similar to CONTU Guidelines on  Photocopying
and         Interlibrary         Arrangements         (available          at
http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ21.pdf – pp. 18-19).


Authorisation for LAME to include, on the non-commercial  basis,  tables  of
contents as well as a reproduction of jacket of a  protected  subject-matter
(or, as the case may be, of the title page – in either case, the quality  of
the reproduction must not allow for a commercial use)  into  the  catalogues
of their collections. – That, in fact, being the way  of  promotion  of  the
item.


Authorisation for LAM, as well as for their associations, to provide  public
services consisting in search in the  contents  of  the  protected  subject-
matters contained in their collections. Recital(s)  of  a  respective  legal
instrument, or another kind of explanation by the EC, would determine  terms
and conditions, as well as parameters of the service, so as  not  to  damage
the legitimate interests of the rightholders.


Authorisation for LAME to perform text  and  data  mining  in  the  sets  of
contents to which they have the lawful access (ie. it is the  use  of  data,
as well as of text on the level of data, not expressions, in databases  that
is in the question).


Authorisation for authors of works of certain kind (contributions in  serial
publications), if they have been created in context  of  research  financed,
in the extent of 50 per cent, at least, from the public resources,  to  make
the works available to the public by the way  of  institutional  facilities,
namely in the version submitted for publication (or in a version of  further
stages of editing) and with the time shift from the first publication  fixed
by the Member State; such a provision cannot be  nullified  or  stripped  of
effect on a  contractual  basis.  (A  "secondary  publication  right"  –  in
context of Open Access.)


Generally – an authorisation (in  particular,  exception  or  limitation  to
copyright) may not be nullified or its effect may  not  be  withdrawn  by  a
contractual agreement (licencing conditions).


Legal framework for agreements on extended collective  licences  in  respect
to written (textual) works  and  images  published  in  the  out-of-commerce
works. Contractual  agreements  should  be  effective  in  the  cross-border
context, either, that applying, in particular, in respect  to  the  uses  by
the LAME both on site and the remote ones by  their  registered  users  with
the use of technical protection measures (TPM). The  levy  for  compensation
should be determined in the country of publication of the expression of  the
subject-matter in question whereto the institutional  user  should  transfer
it to the respective CMO.


     24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide
         for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework
         for limitations and exceptions?

⎬ YES – Please explain why


Yes, definitely. The development in the digital environment is  very  quick,
while the process of legislative changes, in particular,  those  within  the
complex change both on the EU level and on the level of  transposition  into
the law of the Member States, is slow and may  be  blocked  very  easily  by
external factors (complications on political scene). That is  why,  even  in
the case of the principle of periodical review and  updating  the  copyright
having been adopted, it is necessary to build in the element of  flexibility
into the EU copyright framework.

€ NO OPINION


     25.  If  yes,  what  would  be  the  best  approach  to  provide   for
         flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and the  ECJ,
         periodic revisions  of  the  directives,  interpretations  by  the
         Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of  a  fair-use
         or fair dealing provision  /  open  norm,  etc.)?  Please  explain
         indicating what would be the relative advantages and disadvantages
         of such an approach  as  well  as  its  possible  effects  on  the
         functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


It  will  be  necessary  to  use  a  number  of  instruments  for   enabling
flexibility while preserving an  appropriate  level  of  protection  of  the
legitimate interests of the rightholders.


Firstly, a provision on "fair use" as well as on "fair  dealing"  should  be
included into the legal prescriptions. No doubt, both  the  explanations  by
the legislature and the judgments of the courts  will  constitute  important
parts of the system perceived, as well as inclusion of an open provision  on
use. (Similarly as there is, in the Copyright Act of the Czech Republic  no,
121/2000 Coll., as amended, a  provision  of  art.  12  par.  5  on  another
possible use in view of necessity  of  consent  of  the  rightholder,  there
should also be included a new provision on  a  new  possible  use  from  the
point of view of a user that shall be lawful if reasonably appropriate  (see
above on "fair use").  The  flexibility  of  the  function  of  law  may  be
facilitated  by  including  –  similarly  to  the  Directive  on  Electronic
Commerce 2000/31/EC – the "notice – take  down"  procedure.  [Note:  In  the
Czech  translation  of  the  Directive,  a  misleading  translation,  namely
"zaznamenání", is used. The  wording  "upozornění  –  odstranění",  or  even
"výzva – odstranění" would be appropriate.] Periodical reviews  as  well  as
possible changes of the legislation, if needed, would  be  complementary  to
basic elements of flexibility introduced. Obvious advantages would  dominate
in such a system –  those  principal  ones  being  higher  degree  of  legal
certainty for  those  of  the  users  who,  on  the  one  hand,  strive  for
development, and, on the other hand, do not want to act in violation of  the
law; consequently,  strengthening   authority/legitimacy  of  the  copyright
which, paradoxically, suffers in a high degree due to the stiffness  of  the
extant legal framework.


There is also an offer of a solution of a kind  of  the  European  Copyright
Code - http://www.copyrightcode.eu/.


     26. Does the territoriality of limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your

See also the response to the question 21: Territoriality  of  exception  and
limitations to the copyright are frequently, in the  everyday  routine,  not
respected since some employers  are  not  actively  aware  (do  not  actuate
knowledge) of this issue. At the same time, however,  possibility  of  legal
action is not excluded, which as  such,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the
library sector on the national and  European  level,  create  the  state  of
permanent legal uncertainty.

     27. In the  event  that  limitations  and  exceptions  established  at
         national level were to have cross-border effect,  how  should  the
         question  of  “fair  compensation”   be   addressed,   when   such
         compensation is part  of  the  exception?  (e.g.  who  pays  whom,
         where?)

 [Open question]

Assertion of the provision on levy  for  compensation  in  the  cross-border
context should be carefully considered since  the  transactional  costs  are
especially high in such cases.  The  impact  of  them  on  the  use  of  the
protected subject-matters might be prohibitive. The levy should  be  set  in
such cases only when the uses play a real  (reasonably  high)  role  in  the
media environment.


In principle, the levy for compensation should be determined in the  country
where the making available originates. If the  protected  subject-matter  is
made available  in  a  technologically  similar  way  as  according  to  the
provision of the Directive 2001/29/EC art. 5/3(n) or to  remote  users  with
use of TPM the compensation should be transferred by an  institutional  user
to the institution that makes subject-matter  available.  Referring  to  the
first paragraph, it should be refrained from the compensation  for  the  use
of OCW, at least in respect to the former way of  making  available.  Making
available of a subject-matter in the Internet  environment  without  TPM  in
the context in question should be performed  in  such  cases  only  when  no
compensation is set, or when set (on a flat rate basis) it is  collected  at
the country where making available originates.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[33] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[34].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[35].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

strictly according to its wording. However, the processes of  archiving  and
preservation of digital-born protected subject-matters  have  not  been  set
generally into the motion in the libraries in the Czech  Republic.  (A  very
limited pilot project in respect  to  e-books  has  been  realised.  In  the
process of archiving the Web, the  issues  of  access  to  cryptographically
protected objects on line have  not  been  solved.)  Partial  experience  in
making available of  digital  subject-matters  on  tangible  carriers  cause
worries.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

     32.  (a) [In particular if you are an institutional  user:]  Have  you
         experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements
         with rights holders that enable  you  to  provide  remote  access,

Remote access should be an unalienable feature of the services provided  for

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

     36.  (a) [In particular if you are a library:]  Have  you  experienced
         specific problems when trying to negotiate  agreements  to  enable
         the electronic lending (e-lending), including across  borders,  of
         books or other materials held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials

⎬ YES – Please explain with specific examples


In the research and specialised libraries we encounter  providers  offering,
primarily, "bundles" content  of  which  is  changed  continuously,  without
prior notice. Some titles are excluded from the  offer.  Some  licences  are
limited expressly to the members of the institution,  the  "walk-ins"  being
excluded in such a way.


In respect to the public libraries, the majority of  the  publishers  refuse
to grant a licence for e-lending altogether.

EBLIDA – http://www.eblida.org/, of which the  Association  of  Library  and
Information Professionals is a member, has formulated the principles  of  e-
books      acquisition      and      access      in      2012       already:
http://www.eblida.org/Special%20Events/Key-principles-acquistion-eBooks-
November2012/GB_English%20Version%20Key%20Principles.pdf


The publishers, however, have not accepted it as a basis for negotiations.


The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

     38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences
         do you see in the management of physical and  online  collections,
         including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have
         you encountered?

[Open question]

In the collection  development  (acquisition)  based  on  analogue  material
(and, in principle, also based on material on  digital  tangible  carriers),
there are no substantial problems  in  respect  to  the  copyright.  On  the
contrary, the publishers, aware  of  important  role  of  the  libraries  in
dissipation of education and culture, and in such a way, in reproduction  of
the extant set of users as well as  in  the  production  of  the  new  ones,
strive to broaden their offer to the libraries.


Relatively broad, even if not without any problems (see above), is also  the
cooperation of the publishers and providers of  the  foreign  production  in
respect  to  acquisition  and  management  of  digital  collections  of  the
university and other research libraries, where  public  budget  as  well  as
governing bodies of other educational and research  establishments  fund  in
generous  extent  the  acquisition  of  electronic   information   resources
(hereinafter also "EIR"). However, in this segment as  well,  the  situation
with home publisher significantly differs: in great  part,  they  refuse  to
provide their production for e-lending  altogether,  or  if  they  do,  then
under such terms and  conditions  that  are  hardly  feasible,  or  are  not
feasible at all.


The  latter  applies  even  in  higher  degree  in  respect  to  the  public
libraries.


     39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you
         see between libraries’ traditional activities such as  on-premises
         consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises
         (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What  problems
         have you encountered?

[Open question]

Library activities in the digital environment  develops  in  even  a  higher
degree than before in the sense of providing of  an  added  value  of  their
services in respect to the provision of the learning-friendly place with  an
offer of consultation if needed, place  of  meeting  person  to  person,  of
services enabling to overcome the socially determined differences in  access
to information, culture and education. That is  why,  even  in  the  digital
era, the libraries as real (material) buildings preserve  their  importance.
At the same time, however, the fact they are even now  able  –  and  if  the
changes in question are realized then in the higher  degree  in  the  future
they shall be able – to provide their services  also  to  those  users  that
have, due to the time press so typical for the present time,  to  distribute
the time for the educational, research, as well as free-time  activities  at
their disposal between the variants of necessary stay in their  library  and
of the work which is possible in their home environment. The libraries  have
to develop both directions in profiled, specifically user-oriented  manners.



That is also why the e-lending is so important  for  the  libraries  –  that
being not in prejudice to their traditional forms of their activities.


Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[36].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[37].


     40. [In particular if you  are  an  institutional  user,  engaging  or
         wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a
         collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your
         country to enact legislation to ensure that  the  results  of  the
         2011 MoU (i.e. the  agreements  concluded  between  libraries  and
         collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so  that  out  of
         commerce works can be accessed across the EU?


⎬ YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


It is necessary to formulate the response relatively.


Primarily, in the Czech Republic, the legal framework for  making  available
of digitised  OCWs,  ie.  the  framework  for  conclusion  of  a  respective
extended collective licence (hereinafter "ECL"), has not been  adopted  yet.
The bill proposal had been worked out, however, due to  political  obstacles
has NOT gone thru the legislative  process  (see  also  on  awkwardness  and
slowness of  legislative  process  above).  In  view  of  lack  of  a  legal
framework on the EU  level,  however,  the  cross-border  activity  was  not
supposed.


At the same time, we find it important  to  note:  In  view  of  a  specific
development of the Czech Republic (or the then  Czechoslovakia),  marked  by
multiple  discontinuities  of  rights  in  property,  in  media  sphere   in
particular, the representatives of libraries found  it  possible  to  ask  a
legislation that would contain  a  statutory  provision  (licence)  enabling
directly making available digitised newspapers to the public.

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[38]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[40]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [41].

The Marrakesh Treaty[42] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

     50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with  a  disability  or  an
         organisation representing persons  with  disabilities:]  Have  you

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[43] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[44].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[45]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[46].

 III. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[47]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[48][49].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

     64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope
         and  application  of   the   private   copying   and   reprography
         exceptions[50] in the digital environment?

⎬ YES – Please explain


We respond here, even if the issue reaches partially beyond  the  limits  of
private copying. In respect to the problems that arise in the  practice,  we
hold it for necessary to explain, in a positive way, or provide for, that  –
in view of the Explanatory Memorandum to the (future) Directive  2001/29/EC,
namely the provision of art. 5/2(a)*, as well as with consideration  of  the
Judgment of the Court of Justice of  the  European  Union  of  27/6/2013  in
joint cases C-457/11 to C-460/11 [Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG  Wort)  v
Kyocera, formerly Kyocera Mita Deutschland  GmbH,  Epson  Deutschland  GmbH,
Xerox GmbH  (C-457/11),  Canon  Deutschland  GmbH  (C-458/11),  and  Fujitsu
Technology Solutions GmbH (C-459/11),  Hewlett-Packard  GmbH  (C-460/11),  v
Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort)], the second and the third  questions
– the nature of the original from which  the  reproduction  is  effected  in
relation to the permissibility to  make  a  reproduction  on  paper  or  any
similar medium [Directive 2001/29/EC, art. 5/2(a)] is  not  subject  to  the
regulation and, it follows, it relates in principle to a  reproduction  (the
reprographic one) effected from any  original,  both  analogue  and  digital
one, and with the  use  of  a  combination  of  several  pieces  of  machine
equipment as well.




*"Article  5(2)(a)  allows  Member  States  to  maintain  or  introduce   an
exception for photo/print type  of  reproduction  ("reprography"),  with  or
without remuneration scheme for rightholders,  provided  that  they  are  in
line with the conditions of this Article and notably the "three step  test".
This provision is limited to reprography, i. e. to techniques which allow  a
facsimile, or in other words a  paper  print.  It  does  not  focus  on  the
technique used but rather on the result obtained, which has to be  in  paper
form."

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[53].

     68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border  transaction
         resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same
         levy, or  other  obstacles  to  the  free  movement  of  goods  or

  IV. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[54] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[55]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

     72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is  the  best
         mechanism (or  combination  of  mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you
         receive an adequate remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your

   V. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[56] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[57].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[58]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[59].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

     75. Should the civil enforcement system in the  EU  be  rendered  more
         efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed   with   a
         commercial purpose?

         Internet service providers, advertising brokers,  payment  service
         providers, domain name  registrars,  etc.)  in  inhibiting  online
         copyright infringements with a commercial purpose?  If  not,  what
         measures  would  be  useful   to   foster   the   cooperation   of
         intermediaries?

[Open question]

Internet Service Providers (mediators) should not  bear,  as  long  as  they
comply with the conditions provided  for  in  the  Directive  on  Electronic
Commerce 2000/31/EC, any legal responsibility for the content.


It is necessary to make a point, that the libraries,  archives  and  museums
are in no way in the respective context "mediators".



     77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right
         balance is achieved between the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
         respected and other rights such as the protection of private  life
         and protection of personal data?

  VI. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

     78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a  single  EU  Copyright
         Title, as a means  of  establishing  a  consistent  framework  for
         rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,  as  well  as  a
         single framework for enforcement?

⎬ YES


€ NO


€ NO OPINION




     79. Should this be the next step in the development  of  copyright  in
         the EU? Does the current level  of  difference  among  the  Member
         State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

In any case, it would be a long-term process. Immediate actions should be  –
as stated  also  above  –  to  anchor  all  exceptions  and  limitations  as
mandatory with a very high degree of harmonisation within the EU.


 VII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

     80. Are there any other important matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
         framework for copyright? Please  explain  and  indicate  how  such
         matters should be addressed.

[Open question]

Rightholders should be limited in that sense that they should  not  be  able
to refuse sale of a subject-matter, both published (ie.  in  analogue  form)
or offered for making available to the public,  as  well  as  to  refuse  to
provide services offered to the public for  the  use  by  a  library  or  an
educational establishment. That applying irrespective of the format  of  the
subject-matter – analogue or digital. The rightholders (as  a  rule,  author
and publisher as well as peformer/s and phonogram producer) shall receive  a
fair remuneration.


It could be a similar solution as it is provided for in the French  Code  of
Intellectual Property:


Code de la propriété intellectuelle, Article L133-1:  "Lorsqu'une  oeuvre  a
fait l'objet d'un contrat d'édition en  vue  de  sa  publication  et  de  sa
diffusion  sous  forme  de  livre,  l'auteur  ne  peut  s'opposer  au   prêt
d'exemplaires de cette édition par une bibliothèque accueillant du public."


The offer of the service providers (on the basis  of  contractual  licences)
should contain all kind of uses contained in the Directives  2001/29/EC  and
96/9/EC.

occasions.

of 11 July 2012 on collective management of  copyright  and  related  rights
and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for  online  uses
in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
[3]  Collective Management Organisations play  a  significant  role  in  the
management of online rights for musical works in contrast to  the  situation
where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as  film  or
record producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

[11] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[12] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[13] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[14] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[15] The objective of implementing a “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[16] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.

279/13 (C More entertainment).

also http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-
cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.
[19] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[20] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[21] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[22] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[23] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
