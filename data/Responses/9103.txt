The European Law Institute (ELI) is an independent non-profit organisation established to
initiate, conduct and facilitate research, make recommendations and provide practical
guidance in the field of European legal development. Building on the wealth of diverse legal
traditions, its mission is the quest for better law-making in Europe and the enhancement of
European legal integration. By its endeavours, ELI seeks to contribute to the formation of a
more vigorous European legal community, integrating the achievements of the various legal
cultures, endorsing the value of comparative knowledge, and taking a genuinely pan-
European perspective. As such its work covers all branches of the law: substantive and
procedural; private and public.

The ELI is committed to the principles of comprehensiveness and collaborative working, thus
striving to bridge the oft-perceived gap between the different legal cultures, between public
and private law, as well as between scholarship and practice. To further that commitment it
seeks to involve a diverse range of personalities, reflecting the richness of the legal
traditions, legal disciplines and vocational frameworks found throughout Europe. ELI is also
open to the use of different methodological approaches and to canvassing insights and
perspectives from as wide an audience as possible of those who share its vision.

    I.   INTRODUCTION

On December 5 2013 the European Commission (the Commission) launched a public
consultation as part of its on-going efforts to review and modernise EU copyright rules.* This
consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, but is broader in scope
and raises questions of fundamental importance for the future development of EU copyright
law.

The European Law Institute's Working Group on EU Copyright Law, which was established in
January 2014, welcomes this fundamental approach. Copyright has been harmonised since
the early 1990s by nine EU Directives. In addition to the Directives, Recommendations and
Green Papers and the ever growing body of case law of the Court of Justice of the European
Union have to be taken into account as an essential part of European copyright. Additionally,
copyright law is subject to a tight net of international conventions.

This diversity of legal sources, many of which provide for minimum harmonisation or allow
for different options for Member States, has led to friction and incoherence. Although
subject to EU Directives, fundamental issues like copyright limitations and exceptions are not
yet harmonised to an extent that would suffice for the establishment of a truly Single Market
for copyright-protected works. Moreover, some of the core principles of copyright law have
still not been addressed by EU law. Moral rights have so far been excluded from EU
copyright law, which in the long run will undermine their importance. Other areas almost
untouched by the European Union are contract law in the area of copyright, e.g. publishing
or licensing contracts, and initial ownership in copyright, especially in employment
relationships.

Members of the Working Group take the opportunity given by the consultation to provide
answers to some of the general questions raised by the Commission. This document follows
the order of questions of the consultation document. Questions addressing specific
experiences of stakeholders have been omitted.

 II.   RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET

A. Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
   Europe?

Questions 1-7 address specific experiences of stakeholders.

B. Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised (or
   not) in digital transmissions?

8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content
   is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?

9. Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect
   on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not,
   whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your
   remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive
   relief)?

The questionnaire correctly describes the act of “making available” as an act, which not only
may occur in the State where the upload is effected, but which affects all countries in which
the service can be effectively accessed. This second aspect of making works available was
discussed in the CJEU's ruling in Football Dataco v. Sportradar (C-173/11), where the Court
held that “re-utilisation” in terms of the Directive No. 96/9/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases (“Database
Directive”) occurs only in those countries, which are targeted by an Internet service
provider. This criterion had already been applied by the CJEU in the trade mark case L'Oréal
v. eBay (C-324/09). This approach strikes a reasonable balance between interests of right
holders and users and should be used by the European legislator as a starting point when
considering a statutory clarification. However, the legislator should take into account that
copyright is not a purely market-oriented exclusive right. It may therefore be justified to
adjust the criterion of targeted markets to the special nature of copyright as an economic
and moral right. The legislator should resist any attempt to expand the territorial scope of
the “making available” right by merely focusing on the technical availability of content;
instead, countries in which the content has not been accessed (at all or at least not by a
substantial number of users) should not be encompassed. The CJEU was not very clear on
this point in the case Pinckney v. Mediatech (C-170/12), which is cited in the questionnaire.
However, one should keep in mind that the case was not related to the “making available”
right but to the online distribution of physical copies only. Moreover, the decision was
criticized thoroughly by commentators for its broad interpretation of the rules on
jurisdiction for copyright infringement. Thus, Pinckney v. Mediatech should not be used as a
model for future legislation with regard to the making available right.




                                                                                              7
10. Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online
    environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

The question and the explanation given in the questionnaire are based on two assumptions:
1) the “reproduction right” and the “making available right” are held by different parties; 2)
the holder of the reproduction right is in the position to prevent licensing of the “making
available right” due to the unavoidable reproductions that are generated for a transmission
in a network. This second assumption is highly questionable: The grant of a licence for
“making a work available” typically includes – explicitly or implicitly – the licence for the
making of incidental copies. Moreover, Art. 5 para. 1 of the Directive 2001/29/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (“Information Society
Directive”) covers certain incidental reproductions. Therefore, the Working Group considers
the parallel application of the making available right and the reproduction right with regard
to digital transmissions as not being problematic.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
    under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the
    authorisation of the right holder?

The question of whether referencing to publicly available websites by hyperlinks involves an
act of communicating to the public and, as such, is subject to the right holder's
authorisation, was decided by the CJEU on February 13 2014 in the case Svensson (C-
406/12). The CJEU ruled that Article 3(1) of the Information Society Directive must be
interpreted as meaning that the provision on a website of clickable links to works freely
available on another website does not constitute an ‘act of communication to the public’.
However, one should bear in mind that the CJEU was also of the opinion that linking could, in
principle, amount to such a communication if the hyperlink allowed a "new public", which
was not addressed by the targeted original website, to access the content. Thus, the CJEU's
approach is not without limits. In cases in which specific protected material, although
technically available to the public, was not found by a higher number of users before the
hyperlink was published, e.g. if the content is uploaded to a one-click hosting service (also
called cyber-locker or sharehoster) and the hyperlink sent to the individual user is
afterwards published on the Internet, the provision of a hyperlink may well be regarded as a
communication to a new public in the sense of Svensson. For so-called “frames” by which a
website uses a link to incorporate parts of a targeted website into a frame of its own service,
additional criteria may become relevant, especially where the incorporation is effected in a
way that substitutes the visit of the original website entirely, in particular if the user is no
longer aware that he is linked to another website ("embedding"). Under such circumstances,
the fact that the content was already available to the public is still true; however, it can
hardly be argued that such uses of third-party content would not be an appropriation.
The delineation of such forms of framing and linking is complex and admittedly, it would not
be easy to find an appropriate legal regulation at this stage of the technical and legal
development. Since the question of whether frames should be qualified as communication
to the public is currently pending before the CJEU in the case Bestwater International (C-
348/13), it seems advisable to wait for the CJEU's judgment. In case a legislative initiative
                                                                                              8
proves to be appropriate, Recital 23 of the Information Society Directive might be amended
with a list of criteria. Such an approach would still leave room for further clarifications by
case law with regard to new types of hyperlinks. By contrast, any static rule in the regulatory
part of a Directive would be at risk to be outdated before its implementation in the Member
States.

12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a
    work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
    memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
    subject to the authorisation of the right holder?

According to Art. 2 of the Information Society Directive, temporary reproductions are as a
matter of principle already subject to the right holder’s authorisation. However, Art. 5
provides for an exemption of temporary acts of reproduction, which are an integral and
essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable lawful usage.
Recital 33 specifies that temporary reproductions, which are necessary for browsing or
caching, should be exempt from the reproduction right. Therefore, under the current rules,
the mere viewing of a website does not require the authorisation of the right holder. This
solution is in line with the general conception of copyright law according to which mere
consumption (like reading a book, hearing music or viewing a painting) is free. This
conception should be upheld in future legislative instruments irrespective of the technology
that applies.

Question 13 addresses specific experiences of stakeholders.

14. What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of
    previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content)
    concerned.

With a view to a possible legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content, the Commission should bear in mind that a right holder’s response to a
liberal approach might be an application of technical measures to avoid the allowed resale.
If the exhaustion approach applied in the offline world shall be mirrored in the online world,
the legislation should provide for certain flanking measures, for instance similar to those in
Art. 6 para. 4 of the Information Society Directive, however, taking into account the
circumstances in question and the evidence accumulated in the meantime on the
effectiveness of such measures.




                                                                                             9
C. Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
    licensing of works and other subject matter?

16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

18. What incentives for registration by right holders could be envisaged?

Although Art. 5 para. 2 of the Berne Convention provides that the enjoyment and the
exercise of the rights under the Convention shall not be subject to any formality, the
European legislator should not disregard registration systems as a possible political choice.
Art. 5 para. 2 is only applicable to rights covered by the Convention, special agreements
supplementing the Convention and other treaties referring to the Berne Convention. Also,
the Convention is silent on the protection in the country of origin, see Art. 5 para. 3.
Therefore, even under the Berne Convention, there is still some room for manoeuvre.

Registration systems could serve as a source of information through which third parties
could find information about the protected works, the scope and term of protection, the
identity and contact information of right holders, and – depending on the concrete design of
the registration system – about the terms under which the works may be used by potential
licensees and users. The creation of a EU-wide registration system could be built in such a
way as to provide for the possibility of recordals of transactions, e.g. along the lines of the
Community Trademark, and thereby enable use of copyright assets as collateral for
financing, with significant benefits in terms of access to financing. Also, a registration system
would allow for the establishment of a similar system as in the case of Community Design:
After a first – much shorter – protection period, the right holder could be required to
register before enjoying the full term of protection. Such an approach could be of particular
interest for works of a functional or technical nature. As such, works with short-term
economic interest would fall into the public domain much earlier.

A registration system would entail costs for right holders. During any further consideration
of a registration system, care for authors who might not have sufficient capacity to bear
costs must be borne in mind. However, a registration would give evidence of the economic
interests in the further exploitation of a work; compared to the expected earnings, these
costs would be insignificant for copyright industries. Beyond that, a registration system could
be accompanied by special incentives, e.g. higher amounts of damages, longer terms of
protection etc.

D. How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

Question 19 addresses specific experiences of stakeholders.


                                                                                              10
E. Term of protection – is it appropriate?

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?

Economists are sceptical about the idea that an expansion of the copyright term increases
creativity. The effects may even be adverse. An overlong copyright term may limit, rather
than encourage, a work's dissemination, impact and influence. It can be burdensome to find
out the right holder´s name and address and to obtain the rights to use older contents. As
such, an overlong term of protection may impede the creation of new works. Economists are
also sceptical about an undifferentiated regime of copyright terms (see the joint position
paper “The Proposed Directive for a Copyright Term Extension, A Backward-Looking
Package”, http://www.cippm.org.uk/downloads/Term%20Statement%2027_10_08.pdf). It
may be justified for some works of quality to accept duration of copyright protection for fifty
or seventy years after the death of the author. But for the bulk of minor works of a
functional or technical nature, which today are also covered by copyright, such long terms of
protection risk being inefficient. The legislator should therefore refrain from further
extensions for copyrights or neighbouring rights. In contrast, one should consider whether
the term of protection can be reduced for categories of works, which typically go out of use
after a shorter period of time, e.g. software.




                                                                                            11
III.   LIMITATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS IN THE SINGLE MARKET

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided
   in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a
   higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

The optional nature of Art. 5 para. 2 and 3 of the Information Society Directive has
prevented the substantial harmonisation of the Member State's copyright limitations and
exceptions. Even some of the core limitations, e.g. the right of reprographic reproduction
and the private use exception in Art. 5 para. 2 lit. a) and b), have not been implemented by
all Member States. Therefore, if a lawyer reproduces an article from a law review by a
reprographic photocopier, this is covered by the implementation of Art. 5 para. 2 lit. a) in
Germany and France but not in the UK. The use for reporting current events by press and
other media in Art. 5 para. 3 lit. c) provides another example for highly divergent national
legislation. A report to the Commission of 2007 by Guibault, Westkamp, Rieber-Mohn,
Hugenholtz et al. contains a detailed analysis of the implementation of the Directive,
concluding that harmonisation for limitations and exceptions has hardly been achieved due
to their optional nature and their broad and categorical terms. This picture has not changed
substantially ever since. The problems arising from this heterogeneity obviously thwart a
comprehensive implementation of the Internal Market. This is true for physical goods, but
also increasingly affects the online markets. Therefore, limitations and exceptions – being
the most important tool for balancing all interests involved – should be mandatory for
Member States to a large degree.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
    catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree
    of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by
    national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
    Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
    open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
    disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of
    the Internal Market.

One major difficulty with the current closed list of limitations and exceptions in Art. 5 of the
Information Society Directive is its lack of flexibility. The fast developing media services and
technologies require a more flexible regulatory approach, which allows for prompt
adjustment of copyright rules to new legitimate uses of protected materials. The legislative
process, especially in the complex EU setting, is not well suited for quick response to the

                                                                                             12
specific needs of user groups. Legislative instruments are the outcome of long-winded
consultations with stakeholders and interest groups. The issue of orphan works has, for
instance, shown how burdensome such a process can be. The process to pass the Directive
2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on certain
permitted uses of orphan works (“Orphan works Directive”) took more than three years,
and the rules are not yet implemented in all Member States. Beyond that, it is questionable,
whether a patchwork approach with special Directives for concerns of limited range would
provide an appropriate legal framework. Against this background, the further alignment of
the limitations and exceptions to newly emerging concerns should primarily be allocated to
the courts. Courts are better suited to advance legal development based on specific use
cases. This does, of course, not exclude the possibility of condensing established case law
into codified law at a later stage. However, judicial development of new copyright
limitations and exceptions should be guided by a list of general criteria which define the
pre-conditions and limits of the courts’ authority to recognise new limitations and
exceptions. The three step test in Art. 5 para. 5 of the Information Society Directive could
serve this concern, if it was interpreted as an opening clause (see Declaration on a balanced
interpretation              of           the            Three             Step            test,
http://www.ip.mpg.de/files/pdf2/declaration_three_step_test_final_english1.pdf). Beyond
that, section 107 of the US Copyright Act (“Fair use”), could be used as a starting point for a
more liberal approach. However, it should be borne in mind that broad fair use exceptions,
as blanket clauses in general, come with the inherent risk of legal uncertainty. Only big
players, such as service providers for instance, may have the necessary financial resources
for long-winded court procedures. At the same time, those service providers may capitalise
the time prior to a final decision to establish their services in the market. Experience from
previous years has shown that these challenges of the fair use approach are not a mere
academic concern.

Therefore, the EU copyright system as a matter of principle should stick to its current
approach providing a list of specific statutory limitations and exceptions. However, this list
should be supplemented with sufficient flexibility to enable courts to develop tailor-made
solutions for newly emerging legitimate uses. At a later stage, established judge-made rules
based on legal practice, could, where appropriate, be modified and codified, notably by
establishing the requirement of a fair compensation. Such a new European approach would
combine flexibility with legal certainty.

26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
    a problem?

The territoriality of limitations and exceptions poses a significant legal problem in the
context of the pan-European exploitation of works. As mentioned in relation to questions
21/22, usage of protected subject matter may be legal in one Member State, but illegal in
another and thus require the authorisation of right holders in the latter. This imposes
transaction costs on users and may frustrate the establishment of pan-European services.
Moreover, the fragmentation of limitations and exceptions discriminates users vis-á-vis right
holders: the most important exclusive rights in the field of copyright are fully harmonized by
Art. 2 to 4 of the Information Society Directive. Therefore right holders can rely on almost
                                                                                            13
identical rules in the 28 Member States of the EU. By contrast, service providers, but also
creative users of protected material, are under a duty to manage 28 different legal regimes
with significant differences. This problem can only be mitigated by a higher level of
harmonisation of limitations and exceptions (see the Commission's Reflection Document
“Creative content in a European digital single market: challenges for the future”, 22 October
2009, p. 15). With a higher level of harmonisation, the European legislator could also
consider establishing the “country of origin principle” with regard to limitations and
exceptions. Such an approach could either be implemented in Art. 3 of the Directive
2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal
aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce (“E-Commerce
Directive”), in the Internal Market and its appendix or in a new provision of the Information
Society Directive.

27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have
    cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed, when
    such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Cross-border effects may only occur if the European legislator mitigates the territoriality
principle for limitations and exceptions, e.g. by introducing a country of origin approach.
Under this assumption, it would be consequent – and convenient for right holders and users
– that a compensation regime was administered centrally in one country. This requires
appropriate statutory rules for collecting societies and their suitable organisation.
Ultimately, the scope of the Directive on the collective management of copyright and related
rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses in the internal
market (text currently agreed by Parliament and Council negotiators) might need to be
extended in later revisions. In case of an alteration of the current compensation regime it
should be ensured, however, that the total amount paid to right holders would not decrease
or increase (subject to adjustments for other reasons, e.g. the implementation of more
mandatory exceptions and limitations with compensation requirement could increase the
total amount paid to right holders).

It should be noted, however, that problems of cross-border effects of limitations, exceptions
and collection of compensation under the current regime may occur as well. In the case
Stichting de Thuiscopie v. Opus (C-462/09) the CJEU invited the national courts to solve these
problems by interpretation of the national implementation rules of the Information Society
Directive. This suggests indeed a need for action.

Questions 28-63 address experiences of parties privileged by specific limitations and
exceptions.




                                                                                              14
IV.    PRIVATE COPYING AND REPROGRAPHY

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
    private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

Case law shows that problems related to Art. 5 para. 2 lit. a) and b) of the Information
Society Directive primarily arise from the unclear contours of the required “fair
compensation”; not even the CJEU provided for sufficiently clear guidelines. In addition, the
previously explained criticism of the optional nature of Art. 5 para. 2 and 3 (see comments
to question 22) should be taken into account. A truly Single Market may only be established
if the exceptions for private copying and reprography (amongst others) are altered into
mandatory provisions and if the compensation systems in the Member States are
compatible, notably if they lead to comparable revenues for the different groups of right
holders.

Beyond that, however, it is questionable to what extent copyright law should continue to
treat digital technologies differently today. Copies and reproduction increasingly – and
beyond mere private use in terms of Art. 5 para. 2 lit. b) – are no longer effected on paper;
notably companies base their activities (e.g. archives) on digital data storage. It is hardly
comprehensible that copyright law, without differentiation, should enable right holders to
prevent that. Rather, copyright law should ensure adequate compensation of right holders,
and it may narrow down the scope of a technology-neutral exception to a degree that
avoids harm to right holders – but copyright law should not produce effects that impede
ordinary contemporary business activities.

On the other hand, the ever increasing complexity of copying and reproduction technologies
entails an incremental need for specialised intermediaries. They play a very important role in
developing new business models for the use of works. This ultimately serves those right
holders who are not themselves in the position to develop such platforms – of course under
the pre-condition of their adequate compensation. Individual licensing hardly ever provides
a convincing alternative today. The overly complicated clearing of rights makes legal
certainty impossible. Legal certainty, however, is the pre-condition for the functioning of the
copyright related markets. It only may be ensured by copyright law itself; copyright law
therefore has to define the allowed activities of intermediaries and to provide for clear
contours of an appropriate compensation system.

Related to compensation, two further aspects should be considered. Firstly, individual
licensing of intermediaries – which is the basic requirement to establish copyright compliant
services under the current EU copyright regime – may benefit those right holders who are in
the position of bargaining higher licensing fees, compared to a collective compensation
system. These are, however, not the original right holders – the creators of the work – if
they entirely depend only on their contractual partners. By contrast, the creators benefit
from a collective compensation system – under the condition that copyright law safeguards
an indispensable right to partake in the revenues.



                                                                                            15
Secondly, intermediaries play an important role as to the collection of remuneration for uses
of works. With the decreasing relevance of data carriers (like blank CDs etc.) it is no longer
realistic to believe that end-users may be charged directly through levies. Instead, forward-
looking compensation systems are geared towards intermediaries – for both, the copyright
relevant uses of works by the intermediaries themselves (related to their services) and
copyright relevant activities of end-users (as clients of the intermediaries). The elaboration
of modalities for the re-compensation of intermediaries through end-users (e.g. by an extra
charge on flat-rates) should be left to the dynamics of the market forces.

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service
    that has been licensed by right holders, and where the harm to the right holder is
    minimal, be subject to private copying levies?

In the current system, Art. 5 para. 2 lit. b) of the Information Society Directive interacts with
Art. 6 para. 4 subpara. 1 resp. 2. According to these provisions, Member States are not only
free to implement a limitation for digital copies for private purposes; they are also not
obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that right holders make available to the
beneficiary of Art. 5 para. 2 lit. b) the means of benefiting from that particular exception in
case of technological copy protection systems. Member States are solely obliged to ensure
fair compensation – if they establish the limitation in national law. In that respect, they also
have to take account of the application (or non-application) of technological measures in
terms of Art. 6 para. 3.

In view of that, question 65 addresses three different issues. Firstly, the reference to
“minimal harm” of the right holder gives reason for discussion. In fact, if the argument of
(lacking) – actual – harm of the right holder would play a role to determine compensation,
this would constitute a paradigm shift. It is true that the CJEU carved out the criterion of
“harm” as justification for “fair compensation” notably stipulated in Art. 5 para. 2 lit. b) (see
primarily the case of Padawan, C-467/08, paras. 39 and 40). It did, however, not provide a
case-by-case analysis, but rather explained the purpose of the stipulated compensation in
general. It is inherent to collective compensation systems that they do not provide for
individual, but rather for rough justice. Therefore, if a new approach should be established
according to which the criterion of actual harm would play a role – which doubtlessly would
be worth discussing –, this could hardly be limited to one particular limitation like Art. 5
para. 2 lit. b).

Secondly, question 65 focuses on business models by which the right holder has licensed a
service. This means that an intermediary – presumably – is paying a license fee to the right
holder for providing his service. This does not mean, however, that end-users – who may
access digital content via that service, possibly freely,– would pay (on a contractual basis) as
well. Since two different forms of uses of works are involved, the compensation for one of
them does not include a compensation for the other one per se. Therefore, it is justified
under the current regime that private copying levies apply to such users as well (see CJEU
case VG Wort v. Kyocera, C-457/11 to C-460/11). If a – new – approach should be established
according to which levies to certain private users would not be imposed, this would again
require a general discussion beyond Art. 5 para. 2 lit. b.
                                                                                              16
Lastly, related to the interaction with technical measures, it is currently up to the national
legislation to prevent double compensation – notably to the detriment of end-users –, on
the one hand based on collective systems, on the other on individual licensing fees. It might
be desirable to provide for more guidance for compelling solutions to this challenge at the
level of EU law.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
    services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on
    different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on
    the one hand and right holders’ revenue on the other?

This question may hardly be answered in the abstract. Answers on the one hand depend on
the design of the services respective to their business models. On the other hand, various
different levy systems co-exist in the Member States.

Generally, the message in the answer to question 64 should be stressed once more: Online
services will increasingly require a shift from levy systems directly charging end-users to
settings in which the service provider (intermediary) is liable for both, the compensation of
his own use of works and the one of the end-user. The revenue of the right holder should
not change overall (subject to adjustments for other reasons), but the efficiency of collective
compensation systems could be enhanced substantially.

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
    subject to levies?

More transparency as a matter of principle would not be detrimental to the credibility of
copyright law. In the current system, it would certainly be of interest for consumers to know
which amount included in the sales price for blank devices (like CDs, DVDs, USB-sticks, but
also smart phones etc.) – depending on their capacity – is conveyed to collective
compensation systems. In the online world, a service provider could be compelled to provide
similar information, according to which a differentiation of the price for his service as such
and compensation for copyright law, would be possible.

Even more important with a view to the social acceptance of costs produced by copyright
law would be the information about the partition of revenues amongst different groups of
right holders. Numerous studies show that consumers are sensitive for the argument of
justice; a great majority particularly does not want to harm individual creators (see the
Report of the EU Observatory, “European Citizens and Intellectual Property: Perception,
Awareness and Behaviour”, OHIM, November 2013). Based on information about the
partition of revenues, it would be very easy to show consumers how by behaving legally they
may contribute to the advancement of creativity. Pre-condition, however, would be that fair
partitioning is imposed by EU law (see also questions 72-74).

Questions 68-71 address specific experiences of stakeholders.



                                                                                            17
 V.    FAIR REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS AND PERFORMERS

72. What is the best mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive
    an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

The principles of copyright contract law should ensure that exclusive rights may only be
transferred or licensed to the extent that they are explicitly mentioned in the contract.
Judges should have the legal means to narrow the scope of abusive buy-out clauses by
contract interpretation. Also, the author should have certain revocation rights if the
conditions for the exploitation of his work change (in case of an overly broad transfer of
rights e.g. if newly emerging technological possibilities are not appropriately applied by his
contractual partner).

In addition, the EU should consider implementing legal remedies for authors allowing them
to claim for an equitable and fair compensation from their counterparts in copyright
contracts. However, one should not be over-optimistic about the effects of such legal
remedies. If works are hardly profitable, there is no justification for additional revenues
beyond the agreed reward. Moreover, copyright contract principles should seek for a
balanced partition of the economic risk; certain profits of exploiters are required to
counterbalance flops and successes. The possibility of judicial overriding of contracts should
therefore be the exception only applicable in excessive cases.

73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
    contracts)?

The harmonisation of copyright contract law in the EU would resolve one of the most
important impediments for the EU-wide marketing of copyright protected works. Under the
current national regimes with highly divergent rules, parties cannot rely that a transfer or
license of copyrights under the law of one Member State has the same effects in another
Member State (e.g. in Germany or Austria contractual transfers are ex lege prohibited). The
Commission has announced on several occasions that copyright contract law could be one of
the next steps towards a truly harmonised copyright regime in Europe. Therefore, the
copyright community expects the Commission to initiate a more concrete dialogue on
copyright contracts. The “Licences for Europe” process is not yet sufficient to solve the
problem.

74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
    address the shortcomings you identify?

It would hardly be feasible, as a short term solution, to establish a directly applicable EU
contract law for copyright and neighbouring right contracts; the interfaces with general
principles of law – governed by substantially different concepts of contract law in the
Member States – are by far too numerous. Therefore, directly applicable EU contract law
(related to whatever subject matter) for the time being only may provide a further (“29 th”)
legal regime which may be chosen as an alternative to the remaining national contract laws.
Further reaching steps – in particular replacing national law – would require an antecedent,
                                                                                           18
largely exhaustive harmonisation of general issues of contract law in the Member States. An
alternative legal regime, however, would not help, but complicate the situation because the
transparency regarding the applicable law for third parties would decrease.

However, the heterogeneity of national contract laws in general does not exclude working
towards greater harmonisation related to specific issues of copyright contract law; consumer
protection provides for a good example of a successful interaction between EU law and
national contract laws; numerous Directives led to a substantive increase of the level of
consumer protection in the Internal Market. Related to copyright law, a number of issues
could be addressed such as the transferability of the exclusive right (currently excluded in
certain Member States), certain requirements to be observed in a transfer or licence
contract (e.g. written form, specification of exclusive rights etc.), consequences of exclusivity
or non-exclusivity of a licence, third-party effects of licences, permissibility of sub-licensing
etc. Furthermore, guidelines for the interpretation of contracts, for the determination of fair
and equitable remuneration or other uncertainties in legal practice might help.

With a view to such harmonisation, the EU should follow a holistic approach, encompassing
all categories of works. Particularities, however, might also be addressed where necessary.
In that respect, differentiations within copyright contract law according to certain criteria –
e.g. mandatory rules with regard to publishing contracts for scientific works – could and
should be aligned with the substantive copyright law. In fact, notably (mandatory)
exceptions and limitations provide for an additional layer to balance the interests of
different categories of right holders.




                                                                                              19
VI.    RESPECT FOR RIGHTS

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
    infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights (“Enforcement Directive”) provides for a high
level of law enforcement against commercial and private copyright infringers. Whereas it
may be questionable whether the current regime is sufficiently deterrent regarding
commercial infringers, enforcement tools against private infringers require more delicate
consideration. In fact, a strengthened enforcement increasingly risks undermining the
acceptance of copyright in society. Overly strict enforcement measures entail weakened
compliance with copyright principles and, as such, may result in adverse effects for authors
and right holders. The European legislator should therefore be aware that exceeding law
enforcement measures against private parties – e.g. double and treble damages as
implemented in some Member States or liability rules for the expenses caused by cease-and-
desist-letters – are not free of social costs. All attempts to amplify law enforcement in the
field of copyright will be followed by strong public outcry, especially from Internet users who
are still alert after the ACTA debate.

Therefore changes of the law enforcement regime should only be taken carefully and with a
balanced approach Stricter law enforcement measures should specifically address large scale
commercial infringers. But what is more, enforcement measures should be balanced with
clearly defined defendant's rights. Particularly, stronger law enforcement measures against
large scale infringers could be combined with efficient rules against the abuse of law
enforcement measures. Beyond that, caps for damages and expenses for private infringers
could be considered. In the special field of the Internet, a political trade-off with user groups
should be sought. In this respect, it should be recalled that all law enforcement measures
are subject to the proportionality principle as laid down in Art. 3 para. 2 of the Enforcement
Directive.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
    involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
    payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
    infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to
    foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

The Enforcement Directive has not harmonised the rules on third party liability in the
European Union. Although it is true that the E-Commerce Directive exempts certain Internet
service providers from liability and precludes national courts from issuing injunctions which
require those providers to install systems for general filtering indiscriminately to all users
(see CJEU, case C-70/2010, Scarlett v SABAM), the requirements for injunctions and damages
in cases of specific monitored infringements have not been regulated at a Union level until
today. This absence of European principles has led to significant differences in Member
States’ laws. Today, this fragmentation poses a serious impediment for intermediaries with
pan-European services. It is burdensome and costly for intermediaries to verify all the
                                                                                           20
different liability regimes within the European Union. Therefore, the Commission should
consider closing this gap on the next occasion.

77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
    between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
    protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Art. 8 para. 3 lit. e) of the Enforcement Directive provides that the right of information shall
be without prejudice to statutory provisions which govern the processing of personal data.
Yet this provision has not resulted in a strong data protection regime, since Internet service
providers can be forced to disclose the names and addresses of private users in case of
alleged copyright infringement. Also, there is no guarantee that right holders may use only
legally obtained information about the user's conduct when approaching the competent
judicial authorities in proceedings under Art. 8. Giving the fundamental character of the right
of privacy, the European legislator should establish more efficient safeguards for the
protection of personal data in infringement proceedings. The jurisdiction of the CJEU in the
case Promusicae (C-275/06) does not provide sufficient protection of the right of privacy
since it leaves too much discretion to the Member States.




                                                                                             21
VII.   A SINGLE EU COPYRIGHT TITLE

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
    establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU,
    as well as a single framework for enforcement?

The establishment of a single EU Copyright Title should be pursued as a mid-term objective
by the European institutions. The current approach of harmonisation by specific Directives
with many optional provisions (notably related to limitations), minimum protection
requirements and open categorical terms has not proved to countervail a great number of
differences in Member States' copyright laws. This results in numerous legal frictions for
cross-border services, which could be cleared most efficiently by a unified EU copyright
system. Art. 118 TFEU provides a sufficient legislative competence for the Union to act.

79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
    level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term
    project?

The drafting and adoption of a single EU Copyright Title is certainly not a short-term project
but will need some years of preparation. In the meantime, the European institutions might
have to react to urgent challenges by adapting the current legal regime. Notably an interim
revision of the Information Society Directive and the Enforcement Directive might be
unavoidable. Such amendments, however, should not predetermine the greater picture of a
future EU Copyright Title.




                                                                                           22
