This consultation is addressed to different categories of  stakeholders.  To
the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of  respondents
most likely to be concerned by them  (annotation  in  brackets,  before  the
actual question). Respondents should nevertheless  feel  free  to  reply  to
any/all of the questions. Also, please note that, apart  from  the  question
concerning the identification of the respondent, none of  the  questions  is
obligatory. Replies containing answers only to part of  the  questions  will
be also accepted.


You are requested to provide your answers directly within this  consultation
document. For the “Yes/No/No opinion”  questions  please  put  the  selected
answer in bold and underline it so it is easy for us to see your selection.


In your answers to the questions, you are invited to refer to the  situation
in EU Member States. You are also invited in particular to  indicate,  where
relevant, what would be the impact of options you put forward  in  terms  of
costs, opportunities and revenues.


The public consultation is available in English. Responses may, however,  be
sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU.


Confidentiality


The contributions received in this  round  of  consultation  as  well  as  a
summary report presenting the responses  in  a  statistical  and  aggregated
form will be published on the website of DG MARKT.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36(a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have  you  experienced  specific
problems when trying  to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or  other  materials
held in your collection?

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


Public Libraries in the UK can currently  purchase  hard  copy  editions  of
trade publisher output but  are  currently  largely  unable  to  license  or
purchase digital copies to lend  owing  to  publisher  fears  that  free  e-
lending would be detrimental to their commercial interests.  For  the  first
time, libraries ability to provide a wide range of popular titles for  their
customers across a range of formats is severely limited. At best,  only  15%
of bestselling e-titles are available for us to  purchase.  The  danger  for
libraries is that as the e-book market grows and hard copy  sales  diminish,
our niche position in  book  lending  becomes  increasingly  precarious  and
peripheral,  such  that  our  role  here  becomes  largely  an  irrelevance.
However, libraries do need to be seen as active partners in  developing  the
e-book market and providing access and support to all  including  those  who
may be effectively economically  disqualified  or  who  are  technologically
challenged.


Following the government commissioned Sieghart Review  into  e-lending,  the
Publishers Association with the Society of  Chief  Librarians  are  carrying
out 4 e-lending pilots to test the effect of  different  e-lending  business
models.  While  any  positive  signs  that  e-lending  is  being   seriously
considered are welcome,  the  practical  outcome  is  that  any  significant
developments in libraries’ ability to provide  a  viable  e-lending  service
are still well over a year away. In any case, there  is  no  guarantee  that
all trade publishers will ultimately agree  to  make  their  digital  titles
available to libraries.


Also, at present, there is no consensus among those who will sell to  us  on
how  and  on  what  terms  digital  product  should  be  made  available  to
libraries. So publishers  such  as  Bloomsbury  tend  to  charge  twice  the
hardback cover price, Harper Collins and Fourth  Estate  charge  a  hardback
price for a license for 26 downloads (in effect at least twice the cost  per
loan of a hard copy book over its lifetime), while others charge a  hardback
or a paperback price for unlimited downloads. These are made available on  a
one copy one user basis - only a few publishers  offer  simultaneous  multi-
user access for a subscription fee.





Libraries are also faced with the problem that digital formats and  delivery
mechanisms are not fully standardised such that once an agreement  has  been
entered  into  with  an  e-books  aggregator  (such  as   Overdrive),   then
‘purchased’  digital  content  is  not  transferrable  to  other  aggregator
platforms. In effect, this ties libraries in to  long-term  subscription  to
aggregator services  if  e-content  is  not  to  be  lost.  There  are  also
technological (or commercial) issues surrounding compatibility  of  download
devices – the most popular e-reader the Kindle does not allow  e-lending  as
well as purchase because  Amazon  treat  it  as  a  proprietary  product  to
encourage e-book purchase from Amazon.

37 If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
To bring clarity to the legal position, we would ask for the EU  to  confirm
whether the principle of exhaustion applies to sales  of  digital  materials
or not.  We would also recommend a change to the EU copyright  framework  to
give libraries a right  to  acquire  and  to  lend  e-books.   Without  this
libraries will have no choice but to rely on licensing  solutions  and  some
publishers could continue  not  to  make  their  output  available  at  all.
Libraries would then  continue  to  be  unable  to  provide  a  commensurate
digital service to supplement their provision of hard copy publications.  An
updated, fairer copyright framework would enshrine  the  right  to  purchase
and e-lend whilst at the same time  ensuring  an  adequate  remuneration  to
authors and other rights  holders.  Any  change  here  should  therefore  be
subject to the publishers’ ability to  protect  their  commercial  interests
through appropriate charging mechanisms. For example,  licensing  agreements
for making digital titles available for a set  number  of  years  or  a  set
number of issues would be appropriate – as long as charges are not set at  a
disproportionately higher rate compared  with  physical  book  lending.  The
limitation of library budgets should not be under-estimated  when  it  comes
to evaluating the commercial implications for publishers  –  a  single  copy
single user model intrinsically prevents unlimited  access.  Thus,  a  large
library authority with a population of  1.2  million  will  most  frequently
only be able to afford to provide a single copy of  most  books.  For  those
unwilling to be put on a waiting list for popular  tiles,  links  to  online
bookseller sites will provide an alternative. In addition,  while  it  would
be counter-productive for popular books  not  to  be  available  for  remote
access, some research material could be made available on  library  premises
only.

Public  Lending  Right  if  extended  to  digital  as  well  as  hard   copy
publication will be able to help protect the interests of authors.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).

38[In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do  you
see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,  including
providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

The answer to question  36  shows  show  how  different  the  management  of
physical and online collections has to be. At present publishers decide  the
limitations of our collection policy, aggregators circumscribe the means  of
long-term provision of e-book content even if it has been  ‘purchased’,  and
hardware/online bookstore providers decide whether  or  not  e-lending  fits
with their business model. The question of whether the physical  and  online
should be not be the same is entirely different. Ideally,  there  should  be
no difference – albeit that industry standardisation,  business  models  and
working practices will need to change and develop  for  the  two  to  become
practically closer.


39[In particular if you are a right holder:]  What  difference  do  you  see
between libraries’ traditional activities such as  on-premises  consultation
or public  lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

[Open question]

Remote access is integral to the concept of  digital  access  and  e-lending
should be no exception. It is  essential  for  public  libraries  to  be  an
integral part of a  networked  society  and  to  provide  a  wide  range  of
information online. If this is restricted unnecessarily,  then  our  digital
offer will be severely  diminished  and  as  a  result  disregarded.  Remote
access e-lending also supports social inclusion policies and our  commitment
to supporting  the  whole  of  our  communities  in  accessing  the  digital
revolution. It should be noted that  the  Review  led  by  William  Sieghart
recommended in March 2013 that public libraries  should  be  able  to  offer
remote e-lending service to their readers, with a full range  of  publishing
being  available,  this  recommendation  being  accepted  by   the   British
government.


There may be exceptions to this general rule in order to encourage  physical
library visits and to limit access to information that  otherwise  would  be
impossible for producers to provide cost effectively.  For  example,  family
history information for genealogists has  been  provided  on  library  sites
only and it is envisaged that the new, free access to  research  periodicals
via public libraries will operate in the same way. However, there  has  also
been a tradition in the UK for online information to  be  provided  remotely
via national agreements on  pricing  models  with  publishers  and  database
producers, which individual library authorities can then take up.
