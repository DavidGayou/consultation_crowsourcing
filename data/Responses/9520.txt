PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:

Name:
Literar-Mechana is a copyright collecting society. Business activities are focused on the administration of rights in literary works. The members of Literar-Mechana are 17.000 authors of all sorts of literature, journalists, film script writers, authors of scientific works, and publishers. Among the rights transferred to Literar-Mechana by the rightsholders are, in particular, those of public recitation and performance, distribution by cable, use of works in school books, and the licensing of sound and picture/sound-carriers as well as that of handling claims to remuneration for reprographic reproduction of protected works and for the sale of blank tapes. Literar-Mechana is operated with the appropriate license, issued by "Aufsichtsbehörde für Verwertungsgesellschaften", the state authority that authorizes and supervises Austrian collecting societies. 
In the interests of transparency, organisations (including, for example, NGOs, trade associations and commercial enterprises) are invited to provide the public with relevant information about themselves by registering in the Interest Representative Register and subscribing to its Code of Conduct.

RIGHTS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET
* The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.  
The last five years we have not received any specific enquiries regarding multi-territorial licensing. It seems to us that in the field of text and film such requests are made only occasionally. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. If you have identified problems in the answer to the question above  -  what would be the best way to tackle them?
We like to emphasize that when an author creates a work, he has exclusive rights over it, without borders. He can then, in principle, licence the exploitation of the work without borders too.
Written text: In the print sector, it is usual practice for authors to assign their rights for the whole world to the publisher who distributes the book; one in some cases the rights are limited to one territory  -  but not out of copyright, but mainly tax-reasons. In Austria, the e-book market has not yet grown to a consolidated form, the main focus of sales of books and literary works is still on the print areas. This fact must not be neglected. Austrian Publishers are presently spending considerable amounts of money on the development of online platforms in order to help the e-book market gain in momentum.  
Generally speaking, in respect of the type of rights administered by Literar-Mechana, no particular further problems have been identified regarding multi-territory licensing. In addition we are convinced that the problems of multi-territorial needs of users are best solved by way of individual agreements or voluntary transfer of rights to collecting societies. Models for multi-territorial licencing in the field of orphan woks or out-of-commerce works and their use by libraries and archives, on the one hand, and by blind and partially sighted persons, on the other hand, are being either on their way or already used in the German speaking area.
Audiovisual literary works: In the EU's audiovisual sector, it is usual practice for authors to assign their rights for the whole world to the producer who finances the film. The reality of the European film and audiovisual sector is that it is fragmented into several markets based on languages and types of exploitation of the works. Indeed, most audiovisual media services, including online, target specific markets. These services do not need and therefore do not request multi-territorial licences.
Anyway, Literar-Mechana fully supports the submission of SAA (Society of Audiovisual Authors), Brussels, which emphasizes that the lack of a harmonised framework for audiovisual authors' remuneration makes it impossible for their CMOs to offer DSPs pan-European licences. There is therefore a need to provide audiovisual authors with a harmonised guarantee of remuneration for the online exploitation of their works that can be exercised by their CMOs. This should take the form of an unwaivable and inalienable right to remuneration. 
Audiovisual authors wish their works to be widely accessible in Europe as long as all the necessary authorisations have been regularly acquired with the producers. In practice, there is no distributor in Europe that is able to exploit audiovisual works in all countries for all modes of exploitation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
Literar-Mechana administer rights in the field of certain secondary uses of already published works and we are supported by the Austrian national legislation, for example in the form of a legal licences (public performing right), remuneration rights (schoolbook, reprography, private copy) or the extension of licensing agreements concluded on the basis of exclusive rights to include works of non-mandating authors and publishers (cable tv, schoolbook). Those rights are by law limited to national territories, the exception may be the licensing of the use of orphan works or our-of-commerce works, which may be extended to cover all EU Member States. 
It is up to the rightsholder to limit the scope of the mandate granted to Literar-Mechana, including limitations on the basis of territoriality. Literar-Mechana would respect such limitation of the mandate. Not least due to the fact that this is required by the Collective Administration Directive. If a rightholder opts for the possibility to administer his/her copyrights himself/herself, the collecting society is not permitted to hand out a licence.
We also refer to our answers to Q 4.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including marketled solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
Generelly speaking, user needs being as they presently are, Literar-Mechanas activities are focused on licencing in Austria. Rights for foreign authors and publishers are generally administered through the network of bilateral agreements. That this is typical of collecting societies and an appropriate practice, too, was not least pointed out to by EU Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston. In her Opinion (case C-351/12), typically in the EU, CMOs operate (whether by virtue of a statutory or de facto monopoly) within the territory of a single Member State and may be required to accept as members any rightholder resident or established within that State. In such cases, they monitor and grant licences to users within the same Member State. A user may obtain a licence for a repertoire managed by a CMO established in another Member State by means of reciprocal arrangements between CMOs, each of them acting on behalf of the other(s) within its own territory.
We cannot but stress that collective administration is the most suited way by which rights can be obtained "in bundles", in one place and at reasonable costs. A prerequisite for this is the form of a monopoly, which guarantees functionality of the organisation and serves user needs, both at the same time.
Written text: In the text sector current legislation is of no hindrance to the development of multi-territorial solutions. This is also confirmed in documents from the European Commission (EC). Commercial users can generally ask for permission to use a work directly from the publisher or author and obtain it on a contractual and up to worldwide basis. Literar-Mechana administers rights for secondary uses.  
And in Austria, this possibility is generally made use of. Offers by Austrian publishers on the E-book market have multiplied. Some one third of publishing houses in Austria release new books in both printed and electronic versions at the same time so that actually most of the newly published books (fiction and audience-related works) appear in both print and E-book form. Nevertheless, in Austria, the e-book market has not yet grown to a consolidated form, the main focus of sales of books and literary works is still on the print areas. This fact must not be neglected.
Whereas, a study commissioned by the Austrian Publishers' Association showed that in the book trade more than half of the publishers (51.3 %) expect losses in sales due  to illegal copying. Also, they regard piracy as the highest risk where distribution of own E-books is concerned. Austrian legislation provides no de facto protection from infringement of immaterial rights in Internet contents since data protection is higher valued than rights protection. Here it should be possible to enhance the commitment of national Internet providers (please see details in our response to Q 75-78). 
Audiovisual literary works: film is an art form and an economic product at the same time. Economic reasons and legal framework excludes the possibility to offer downloads to consumers immediately after the release of a film. No DVD use or download is permitted until six months after the first cinema showing. This provision protects the interest of cinemas and their operators. Similar bans exist for pay-TV and video-on-demand use. Another obstacle which Austrian productions are to face before being net-distributed  -  and one which is unknown to American or German films  -  are the production costs of a copyable digital copy. If for every acquired copy of an particular film there are thousands of illegal copies a decent  ecenomic use of this production becomes impossible. 
In January 2014 the Austrian collecting society of film producers (VAM) revealed plans to make those titles of Austria's highly varied movie repertoire to which copyright regulations or other contractual restrictions no longer apply visible on all the relevant online platforms for the German-speaking or international users, in order to heighten the awareness for their accessibility over the Internet. 
However, Literar-Mechana fully supports the submission of SAA (Society of Audiovisual Authors), Brussels, which stressed that European legislation is needed to ensure that audiovisual authors are remunerated for the online distribution of their works, independently of the country of production and exploitation.
Generally speaking, legislative actions which help to protect rightholders, ensure authors to be remunerated for the online-distribution and help to prosecute the massive infringements of rights on the Internet would, in our opinion, increase the probability that rightholders become more willing to licence contents on the Internet. 
The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions 
* The act of "making available"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Is the scope of the "making available" right in cross-border situations  -  i.e. when content is disseminated across borders  -  sufficiently clear?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X  NO  -  Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
In this context Literar-Mechana wants to point out that all issues which relate to International Law can and should be dealt with by International Law. Other sources, and the Info-SocDir in particular, is unsuited for such purposes.
The scope of the "making available"-right is  -  from our point of view  -  sufficiently clear. Following the "lex loci protectionis" approach, a work should be licensed for each country use. 


However, Literar-Mechana fully supports the submission of SAA (Society of Audiovisual Authors), Brussels, which emphazises that the making available right itself should be clarified by introducing an unwaivable right of authors to remuneration for their making available right, even when exclusive rights have been transferred, so that authors are guaranteed a financial reward proportional to the real exploitation of their works. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the "making available" right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
There is no practical problem relating to the territorial scope of the making available right as presented in above answer to question 8. We would like to reiterate that Private International Law related issues cannot be solved by dealing with the InfoSoc Directive.
2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
This involves two separate rights, which according to International Conventions and the European as well as national laws are vested in the rightholder in the form of his right of interdiction. The practice of successfully handling several licences that one and the same exploitation process might afford has caused no problem in the past, as the simultaneous collection of payments for broadcasting rights and fees from mechanic licences clearly shows.  And with the "making available right" it's all the same.
It is a principle of the Copyright Law that those who created a work and are entitled to use it may exploit each of their rights separately. This applies to digital rights not less than to rights in analogous copying processes of the past. Rightholders represented by Literar-Mechana clearly opt for the maintenance of this principle. 
3. Linking and browsing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the public  -  or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
The fact that there are different ways of linking contents - like deep-linking, digital indexing, referring, embedding, framing, accessing, etc  -  should be taken into consideration when answering this question. Hyperlinking is an integral part of "normal" Internet operations and certainly not under question in this context. Thinking of "embedding" or "framing", however, we find that the rights of rightholders are definitely affected, since copyright protected works are being integrated in a foreign homepage/text.
We understand the purpose of the question as being that of providing relevant user access to copyright works. There are licensing mechanisms in place to enable legal user access, so there is no reason to exempt such an act of (hyper)linking to a copyright work or other subject matter from the requirement of rightholder authorisation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the user's computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO  -  Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
Pure viewing does not need the authorisation of the rightsholder. Reproductions that are both temporary and incidental to an authorised act should not require additional consent from the copyright holder. This does not mean that all "cache" memory copies are to be considered "temporary" or strictly "incidental" ones. The facts of the case need to be analysed and that is best left to the courts. 
Technological development has had the effect that copyright content is increasingly viewed or listened to ("streamed") through computer browsers rather than by the making of downloaded copies. Streaming services are one variety of "on-demand" service, which is specifically referred to in Recital 10 to Directive 2001/29/EC as requiring protection. Taking the e-book-branche as an example new business models like Skoobe.de only offers access to the works. 
If streaming were not subject to rightsholder authorisation, this anomaly would exist in the online environment generally, where the problem of piracy is notorious. The end user must therefore be obliged to obtain a licence to access the underlying work. 
4. Download to own digital content
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
To extend the principle of exhaustion also to online authorisation is, in our opinion, entirely out of question. The right to make available constitutes one part of the right to communicate to the public which is not exhausted when a work has been placed on the market. The European Court of Justice has made this clear in several decisions. In the Oracle databank case, for instance, the European Court of Justice limited the applicability of the decision exactly to the scope in which the Software Directive applies. 
Every E-book that is sold constitutes a new copy which entitles the rightholder to remuneration. This would mean that within short the number of copies available in the markets would have multiplied, and this without benefits to the rightholders. Any other interpretation would mean to expropriate the owner's right in his property in the Internet and to completely ruin the E-book and online markets while destroying an chance for returns from Internet uses. The obligation to delete the original does not seem sufficient for the rightsholders.
* Registration of works and other subject matter 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES, if made voluntary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. Possible advantages of registration, provided it is established on a voluntary basis, include the identification and proof of rights and the facilitation of copyright licensing. However, authors and publishers cannot be required or expected to monitor notifications in the EU and its Member States. 
Besides, setting up such a registration system would be extremely costly, time consuming and would likely never be reliable since it would constantly have to be kept up-to-date. The system is likely to be of advantage to owners of „big" rights only while the owners of "small" rights would be able to afford neither registration nor further monitoring. 
The book branche also make use of an highy established international system for the identification of a book (ISBN), of works (ISTC) and of rightholders (ISNI). Setting up a further register would be useless.
The copyright societies are already collecting societies in large amounts data and comprehensive manner, independent from the selling data or viewing rate. Each year, 7.3 million borrowings are registered and connected to 1.4 million enrolled works in Literar-Mechana alone. Some 60,000 TV and radio broadcasts are entered in the records, stating exact times of the beginning and end. Annually, about 16,000 scientific articles and publications are dealt with in terms of range of circulation. 
* How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?
Identifiers and databases are crucial for the efficiency and transparency of CMO operations. There is a need for CMOs to be able to use such standards to optimise their distribution activities, as required under the EU CRM Directive. 
The Commission should increase efforts to make more stakeholders and users (such as broadcasting organisations) willing to base their operations on international standards (such as ISAN or IDA). 



* Term of protection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO  -  Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
The question of the term of protection touches upon the philosophical justifications of copyright law. The question of a shorter copyright term poses significant challenges. 
To reduce protection periods would, in the opinion of Literar-Mechana, affect copyright owners in a negative way and curtail their right of exclusive exploitation of own works to a large extent. The protection period of 70 years post mortem auctoris has became a standard and is recognised in most parts of the world. This particularly applies to the holders of rights in works of fiction or poetry. It frequently happens that authors do not get much attention until after their death (like, for instance, Georg Trakl, Franz Kafka, Sándor Marai, Stieg Larsson, Vincent van Gogh).  
In other cases, publications disappear from the market altogether after the period of their protection has expired, due to a lack of interest in any form of prolonged professional exploitation. To reduce protection periods would mean to strengthen online platforms that are run by companies with monopolistic business interests and specialised in using works the rights of which have expired, free of charge and without investing in the work as such or in the author. In a small country like Austria this step would inevitably mean that authors and publishers are economially weakened, as they are deprived of their specific Unique Selling Propositions and readers. 
Several arguments in favour of an extension are contained in the respective Recitals of Directives 2011/77/EU, 2006/116/EC and 93/98/EEC and in the Commission's Impact Assessment.

* LIMITATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS IN THE SINGLE MARKET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
The European Union model is based on the various legal and other models and traditions of its Member States. They vary substantially and encompass those of civil and common law countries. This poses challenges to the European Union but it also represents its strength. 
There is nothing to indicate that more mandatory exceptions and limitations would have led to a better result than the pragmatic approach chosen by the EU, based on optional exceptions and limitations, combined with the development of practical solutions on a case-by-case basis to enhance harmonisation, when required and appropriate. 
All needs of users have been satisfactorily met on the basis of international and national laws. Now under discussion in panel meetings of libraries, Literar-Mechana and rightholders are the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding concerning out-of-commerce works whereas the directive on orphan works is just about to be implemented and licencing of the use of text excerpts for Intranet purposes within business companies is soon to come. Also under way are constructive negotiations with providers of E-learning platforms, publishing houses and Literar-Mechana about the best possible way of integrating them into the Austrian Copyright Law.    
Moreover, copyright legislation remains but one of several elements in the package that makes up the framework for the creative industries on a national basis. The mix of elements is carefully chosen to address national requirements and traditions. Flexibility can only be built on general principles, which leaves implementation to the Member States and the parties concerned. In the field of copyright, exceptions and limitations in national legislation are subject to compliance with the three-step test of the Berne Convention, reiterated in EUCD Article 5.5, and adapted to the special needs and legal and other traditions of the individual Member State. In the EU, this general principle is combined with a mandatory and several optional exceptions and limitations. We do not see how more detailed norms on a Community level could serve the purpose of improved access to copyright works or enhanced competitiveness in a changing technological and media environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain by referring to specific cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
In accordance with our response to Q 21, we do not see any particular issue with the optionality of exceptions and limitations in the EU Directives. There does not seem to be a need for existing exceptions to be made mandatory. Flexibility is important to ensure that the copyright framework is fit to the need of the individual Member State. Those needs may vary from one Member State to the other.
In our opinion there is no need for a fundamental and wide-ranging reform of the European Copyright Law. In their totality, the existing regulations and therein contained exceptions and limitations meet all the requirements for solutions that serve the current needs of national and multinational users, be it on the basis of contractual agreements between users and rightholders or on that of agreements between collecting societies. 
In numerous decisions of great significance the European Court of Justice has provided reliable guidelines for the interpretation of EU Directives, particularly if not only of the Info-SocDir. Many more proceedings are pending. We definitely think that the results of these decisions should be accepted and made part of the national practice before heading for a wide-ranging reform of the Copyright. 
In our point of view a system based on exceptions and limitions only has advantages campared to a Fair Use system: in the US, where the fair use doctrine applies, the courts have establied the principles and built a substantial binding case law over the last 200 years, which now allows better choices for users and yield legal certainty to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the legal uncertainty is not always there, since although general principles are publicly available, the consumers and citizies do not read those 200 years long case law each time they would like to use a work without authorisation of rightsholders to analyse whether their ise would be considered „fair use". 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Rather than considering whether to remove or add to the current exceptions and limitations focus should be on the implementation of the existing ones and stakeholder solutions developed on the basis of them. Examples of such stakeholder-driven solutions, which still need to be fully implemented are the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
The optionality of exceptions and limitations in the EUCD provides for a sufficient degree of flexibility. All needs of users have been satisfactorily met on the basis of international and national laws.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute a problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
The territoriality of limitations and exceptions does not constitute particular problems and allows for respect of Member Sates'legal and culturald specificities. 
User requests are in general confined to uses and users within the territory of the headquarters; demands for cross-border or multi-territory licensing are limited and can be satisfactorily addressed on the basis of the current models of operation. 
Some models in the German speaking countries as to usage in internal networks are in development: nonetheless, some clarification of the territorial scope of certain limitations may be appropriate. Internal networks are not always confined to territorial borders. It may therefore be appropriate to clarify that limitations referred to above apply to the complete internal network covered by an agreement with the CMO, and for the specific uses and users authorised by it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to have cross-border effect, how should the question of "fair compensation" be addressed, when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

With respect to rights administered by the local RRO, in situations as described in Q26, remuneration must be paid by the organism that signs the agreement which is authorised, and the remuneration should be collected by the RRO granting the authorisation (covering usage in internal networks of foreign subsidiaries as well). 
Besides, fair compensation be due in the place where the end user benefits from the exception, as is the case, for example, with the private copying exception (levies are due in the country in which the `harm' to the rightholder arises, i.e. in the country in which the end user who bought the product resides according to the Opus ruling of the CJUE). In addition, it is crucial that remuneration be provided to the rightholders in the country where they reside, which is possible thanks to reciprocal agreements between collective management organisations.
Access to content in libraries and archives
* Preservation an archiving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
No problems can be idendified. Quite generally speaking we wish to emphasise that Austria has a long tradition of unanimously agreed solutions, based on negotiations and partnership. This way of conflict handling seems by all means preferable to a unified EU law.  
Besides, InfoSoc-Dir already allows the digitisation for preservation purposes. The Austrian Coypright act already provides for a respective exemption in Prov 42 (7). 
Now under discussion in panel meetings of libraries, Literar-Mechana and rightholders are the presentations copies for the libraries and using possibilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
No problems have been encountered. Quite generally speaking we wish to emphasise that Austria has a long tradition of unanimously agreed solutions, based on negotiations and partnership. This way of conflict handling seems by all means preferable to a unified EU law.  
* Off-premises access to library collections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in question?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research and private study?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Q 32 - 33: Problem-solving depends on the type and character of the problem. Without specifying the problems the question becomes too imprecise to provide an appropriate answer. However, in general, problems are best solved through stakeholder dialogues. 
Organisations representing libraries, archives, authors, publishers and CMOs have a proven track record in developing solutions for libraries and archives through stakeholder dialogues. Examples are principles for rights clearance and registries of orphan works and out-of-commerce works; model licensing agreements for the making available of out-of-commerce works in closed and open networks; the Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works by libraries. Literar-Mechana takes part in all national stakeholder discussions and supports a reasonable implementation in national law.

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
The main challenge is the implementation of solutions already developed and made available.


* E-lending
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x YES  -  Please explain with specific examples

□ NO OPINION
E-lending from libraries can and should, nonetheless, take place, on the basis of con - tractual arrangements with copyright holders or their representatives. Arrangements already exist in several EU Member States. Various models are being explored and the main chal - lenge now is to conclude on the range of models that best serve the assortment of purposes. 
For this reason Austrian publishing houses enter in contract with DiviBib, the e-book-portal of EKZ-Library Service. That organism buys e-books for e-lending, both for German and for Austrian libraries. As a principal, by one licence only one-e-lending is permitted. Libraries enforce business models with flat fees. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
All needs of users have been satisfactorily met on the basis of national laws. Problems have not been encountered. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between libraries' traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?
While in the analogue environment lending and on-premises consultation is not a part of the publisher's or author's business model, e-lending is. As selling access to copyright works, rather than physical copies, is an essential part of the business model in the digital environment, library e-lending will more easily conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholder. Physical copies are being made available in locations they never did before. Also, it may no longer be seen to represent a special case, and thus easily conflict with all three criteria of the three-step test in international conventions that EU Member States are party to. 
In any event, access to E-books is possible from almost everywhere (at least country-wise) by acts of purchase, which means that the task of libraries is more one of channelling products on the market, although accessibility to E-books is usually less costly by way of borrowing than through purchase. 
E-lending is a system which works well. Taking City of Vienna libraries alone, the number of E-lended books accounts already to half a million. Launched in 2010, the digital media service for online users meanwhile includes about 30,000 electronic media. Every month 600 new titles are added to the electronic catalogue. Not long ago, a streaming service was installed that allows the use of digital audio books via iPhone and iPad. Apps for the use in android devices are to follow soon

* Mass digitisation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO OPINION
Now under discussion in panel meetings of libraries, Literar-Mechana and rightholders are the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding concerning out-of-commerce works whereas the directive on orphan works is just about to be implemented and licencing of the use of text excerpts for Intranet purposes within business companies is soon to come. 

The signatories to the EC facilitated MoU on Key principles on the digitisation and making available of out-of-commerce works agreed to call "on the European Commission, to the extent required to ensure legal certainty in a cross-border context, to consider the type of legislation to be enacted to ensure that publicly accessible cultural institutions and collective management organisations which enter into a licence in good faith applying these key principles are legally protected with regard to licensed uses of works of rightholders who have been presumed to be within the scope of the licence." This part of the MoU has not yet been completed.
Whether also national legislation is required depends on and can only be answered when the EC has made known its proposed solution for cross-border accessibility.  
B. Teaching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
Following to the Austrian Copyright Law it is allowed to copy in the amount of the class; when the school is not following even indirect commercial purposes, the organism is also allowed to make copies on digital carriers. Under way are constructive negotiations with providers of E-learning platforms, publishing houses and Literar-Mechana about the best possible way of extending the right to copy to the making available right for internal purposes. We are convinced the process will reach to an end and the limitations and exceptions of Art 5 (3) a InfoSocDir can be used and are sufficient as solid basis. Material published for educational purposes is not allowed to be copied. 
We understand the exception in Article 5(3)(a) as being a narrow exception to the exclusive rights, aimed at enabling exactly what it reads: to illustrate; which is far from being the same as planned producing of teaching material. This understanding of the concept is in accordance with its wording as well as of the opinions expressed by the foremost experts on it. Teaching material in whatever format, including multiple copying for classroom use, cannot and is not destined to be made under this exception, as it would definitely undermine the normal exploitation of these works. To this day, this has been part of the common understanding, nevertheless we want to make it clear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Clarification on Community level that "illustration for teaching" does not comprise the reproduction, making available and distribution of teaching material, such as in the form of arranged, planned or structured multiple copies for classroom use, compilations, e-reserves and the sort would be appropriate. Such access to works is offered by authors and publishers directly, or through rights administration by RROs and other CMOs. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Scientific and research communities already make extensive use of individual licensing schemes offered by publishers. Under way are constructive negotiations with providers of E-learning platforms, publishing houses and Literar-Mechana about the best possible way of extending the right to copy to the making available right for internal purposes. 
We are convinced the process will reach to an end and the limitations and exceptions of Art 5 (3) a InfoSocDir can be used and are sufficient as solid basis. Material published for educational purposes is not allowed to be copied. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what conditions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Individual and collective rights management schemes would be appropriate and welcome. Entering into individual and collective licensing schemes offered to educational establishments by rightholders and the responsible RRO is what provides the broadest and most adequate legal access to intellectual property to the teaching and research communities. 
In a fast changing world, where technologies move with an unprecedented speed, regulations do not have the ability to offer the required flexibility. Licensing agreements do. They offer comprehensive tailor-made solutions to access scientific and literary works to meet the needs of educational institutions. This is the safest, simplest, fastest, most innovative, most convenient and most cost efficient way to seamless access to high quality teaching material from multiple authors and publishers. What's more, flourishing local cultural industries and a healthy educational system with broad access to local resources contributes significantly to the nation's economy and employment.

Q 47- 49: All needs of users have been satisfactorily met on the basis of national laws. Problems have not been encountered. The use of copyright material for research purposes is commonly comprised in the licences offered by the publishers. 
In Austria certain uses of copyright material in relation to research are authorised through statutory limitations with remuneration to authors and publishers (see Prov 42 (2) Austrian Coypright Act. Those mechanisms can be evaluated as best practice.
* Disabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content, including across borders, arising from Member States' implementation of this exception?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in special formats across the EU?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across borders?

52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How successful are they?
Exceptions and limitations in favour of persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled, exist in all EU Member States. Also, RROs administer statutory provisions or offer licensing agreements to facilitate access to copyright published works for those user groups. 
The main challenge is linked to the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. The WIPO Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled, will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the cross-border exchange of such copies. It will, however, take time for the Treaty to come into force and be implemented in national legislation. Also, it may not alone solve all challenges.   
The Austrian, German and Swiss RROs, Literar-Mechana, VG Wort and Prolitteris, administer statutory licences and have developed solutions for certain cross-border issues regarding material in the German language. Thus, there exist solutions in the market place, as well as initiatives and pilots that can be built further on. Their success in the EU is dependent on the willingness of the EC and the EU Member States to invest in them and also support financially the development of the required networks that the stakeholders stand ready to establish and maintain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Q 58-63: From Literar-Mechana's point of view it is completely unclear what the meaning of User-generated Content is. A clear definition is missing.
From the viewpoint of rightholders a significant aspect of copyright protection is not only unauthorized usability of own works for economic purposes, but also the issue of personal rights. It is of high interest to know, and have control of, the (political, social, economic) context in which the own work is used, and to procure that the own work continues to exist in its original version and without unauthorised alterations.  
In Austria, the problem of who owns the copyright in a work is generally solved easily and without delay. There are eight collecting societies where necessary information can be obtained and assistance is provided in the search for the respective rightholder. There are many cases, especially in the field of literature, where no fee at all is charged for a licence to use a work in a particular way. What is also striking with UGC is the claim of some users to create UGC content without seeking the permission of the authors of the pre-existing works, but do ask for recognition of their rights on the new works.
In other cases, specific exceptions  -  like, for instance, in the case of quotation  -  enable users to use copyrighted works even without a licence. The alternative for those who wish to spare the time and trouble to ask for a licence is to use material that is not protected by copyrights or was published under a Creative Commons licence that permits "adaptations and arrangements". 
PRIVATE COPYING AND REPROGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the private copying and reprography exceptions in the digital environment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
There is a need for clarification that, in respect of text and image levies, "rightholders" eligible for "fair compensation" comprise both authors and publishers.  
The exemptions in Articles 5.2.a and 5.2.b were already interpreted in several of the directives issued by the European Court of Justice. Numerous cases are still pending before the Court. There is other way than to wait for the decisions and, when available, make them applicable in the national jurisdiction. 
Rightholders have already responded to the specifications of the European Court of Justice. Parts of the payers are little willing to act accordingly. This means that rightholders will have to try to enforce their right  -  which has already been confirmed in European Court of Justice proceedings  -  in, even more, costly lawsuits, and this vis-à-vis market players with monopolistic claims, who prolong proceedings in order to escape the liability to pay.  
Otherwise, there is no need to change articles 5.2 (a) and 5.2 (b) of the EUCD. In particular, it must continue to be a requirement that certain exceptions are only permissible if fair compensation is provided to the rightholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that has been licenced by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□  NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
The CJEU decided in the VG WORT case (C-457/11-C460/11) that a possible consent by the copyright holder to the copying of his work or other protected material in the context of the exceptions or limitations provided for in EUCD Article 5.2 and 5.3 has no effect on fair remuneration payable under the exception. This means that remuneration paid to the author or publisher under a licence does not preclude from receiving the fair compensation for the exception or limitation. Such copies may therefore be covered by the levies, if provided for in national legislation. 
Whereas, the question is not very clear, since the concept of `minimal harm' is confused with the question of application of levies when a service is licensed. Therefore this answer will focus on contractual authorisations' impact on the application of private copying, which was also addressed by Mr Vitorino's report, y stating in the first Recommendation (in Part 1 "New Business Models, Licensed Services and the Private Copying Exception") that copies made by end-users for private purposes from a licensed service do not cause any harm (therefore not requiring the corresponding remuneration from private copying levies), Mr Vitorino basically suggests eliminating private copying levies, notably for so called "new business models in the digital environment". 
This represents a gross misconception of the private copying system. Practically, digital service providers that offer e.g. a download service through a licence they receive from rightholders for that download service are different than e.g. manufacturers of devices who are responsible for the payment of the levies (which they will pass on to consumers, who are actually making private copies) for the subsequent private copies of those downloads that are made by consumers. Therefore, what is licensed by a service is different from what is subject to private copy levies. Licensed services receive an authorisation for the exploitation of works based on the specificities of each business model, while the remuneration for private copying is organised through the levy-based system to guarantee that consumers are able to make private copies (as an exception to copyright), whatever the service's business model is. The CJEU also clearly dismissed Mr Vitorino's analysis in this respect by ruling that:
"Where a Member State has decided, pursuant to a provision in Article 5(2) and (3) of Directive 2001/29, to exclude, from the material scope of that provision, any right for the rightholders to authorise reproduction of their protected works or other subject-matter, any authorising act the rightholders may adopt is devoid of legal effects under the law of that State. Consequently, such an act has no effect on the harm caused to the rightholders due to the introduction of the relevant measure depriving them of that right, and cannot therefore have any bearing on the fair compensation owed, whether it is provided for on a compulsory or an optional basis, under the relevant provision of that directive."
Licensing is seen [by Mr Vitorino] as a way of eradicating private copying levies, which is contrary to the model applied today in most EU countries where the systems are complementary. By adopting such a position, Mr Vitorino  - and this questionnaire by suggesting such a solution - goes back in time to when the very principle of the private copying exception in the digital era was challenged by those who called for the implementation of technical protection measures (TPM) instead. This was not the solution ultimately chosen in Europe under the 2001 Copyright Directive.
Such a proposition would:
- deprive consumers of their ability to legally make copies for private purposes unless such copies have been authorised by rightholders;
- involve the re-introduction of technological protection measures which consumers have massively rejected in the past. Here again the CJEU recently ruled that the possibility of applying technological measures does not necessarily mean that the private copying remuneration is not applicable;
- require to negotiate the remuneration for private copying (which normally falls under an "exception" that cannot be negotiated) in the purchase price of the digital content, compelling the rightholders to very difficult negotiations with companies benefitting from a huge bargaining power and leading to an increase of the prices to the detriment of consumers. In any case, higher prices are difficult to achieve because of the availability of content illegally online, for free. 
From the viewpoint of the Austrian book trade this is but a fictitious debate: a study launched by the Austrian Association of Publishers showed that 20 % of the publishers use no copy protection method at all. Little more than 65% protect their products by means of watermarks, a method that produces little more than a psychological barrier. Even with them, copies for the private use are still possible.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders' revenue on the other?
Private copying and reprography remuneration schemes are fully compatible with the development of new business models, products and services related to digital content. The emergence of new business models, as well as of the consumer devices, has exponentially grown over the past years, without being affected by private copying remuneration schemes.
The market penetration of new devices and services, such as smart phones, tablets, cloud, etc. has not been prevented by the existence of private copying remuneration schemes. On the contrary, those markets have grown exponentially over the last years. A recent study on the economic effects of private copying levies indicates that, if private copying or reprography remuneration is removed, device manufacturers' revenues would also decrease in the long term since the incentive to invest in new content would fall. Indeed, private copying compensation is an essential part of copyright income for authors and publishers deriving from the digital market. The private copying and reprography remuneration represents on average 5% of the European authors' and publishers revenues, although with notable differences between countries. In France, one of the most important markets, revenues deriving from private copying in 2011 amounted up to 192,4 million EUR, around 43% of which was for authors (e.g. for music, audiovisual, visual art, literary authors). This means more works, jobs and growth for the whole creative chain in Europe. 
Member States where private copying and reprography compensation is provided should extend the scope of levies to the services that allow individual consumers to copy their copyright content for private purposes on their devices. In this respect, the CJEU in its Padawan ruling several times mentions that private copying could be made not only by "digital reproduction equipment, devices and media but also by copying services". Depriving authors and publishers from this income would seriously harm their earnings and would take away one of their well-established direct revenue streams on the basis of ill-founded assumptions. 
In Austria where levies exist, it would be appropriate that consideration be given to whether new possibilities of remuneration for the authors and publishers need to be introduced in view of the increasing use of cloud services in the form of streaming, which does not result in permanent storage. Nevertheless, Cloud services are various and they are not homogeneous. It is therefore necessary to analyse these services on a case-by-case basis before determining the legal regime applicable to them. But, where authors and publishers are remunerated for certain uses on the basis of copyright levies, the device and storage medium remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in connection with online services (e.g. cloud computing). That is, for example, the case if works are downloaded from a cloud portal and stored on a PC or storage medium or even if they are only stored in the Cloud. Literar-mechana also believes that the application of levies to certain online services is justified and does not think that it would hinder the development and functioning of new business models. 
One of the reasons being that, just like the prices of products across Europe do not vary in proportion to the levy rates, the prices of online services/new business models are most probably also unaffected by the levy rates. 
In the past, this „remuneration system" has formed the basis for numerous Austrian business models. It is a system that both rightholders and consumers can well cope with, and one that requires no monitoring at all.  
Opposition on the equipment trade side against the levy systems is hardly justifiable: In Austria, the respective revenues amount to a few percent of annual sales in electronics stores and are hardly significant, if compared to the turnovers achieved by international companies and measured in billions. Changes in the system and even a transfer of the liability to pay levies from the company that imports a device to the distributor would inevitably lead to an increase in administration costs. There would be less money left for rightholders.

 - □ NO OPINION
Private copy: The current system functions perfectly and does not lead to any undue payments. Undue payments are avoided by a smart reimbursement scheme which allows differentiating between private and commercial users. About one third of all blank media in Austria (including hard discs) are used by commercial entities. Cross-border transactions are no issue since any importer and direct seller of blank media in or to Austria has to pay the levy. The importer or direct seller may obtain reimbursement of a foreign levy from that Member State, in accordance with the Amazon ruling. Due to their permanent increase, direct sellers should be subject to better control and enforcement by the collecting societies, in order to fight abuse and circumvention of the private copying regimes. 
Reprography: In respect of text and image levies, the refund of device and storage medium remuneration in the event of export takes place through Literar-Mechana quick and without problems in the vast majority of cases. On the other hand, there are substantial problems linked to vendors of devices based in another EU Member State refusing to pay the levy. That led to cost-intensiv proceedings in Austria  -  proceedings which are delayed by the vendor in any instance. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
Private copy: see our answer at Q 68.
Reprography: In respect of text and image levies, the question is irrelevant, as noted also in the report from the EC-appointed mediator António Vitorino. Unlike the scope of the private copying exception under EUCD Art 5.2(b), which is limited to reproductions that serve a specific purpose ("for private use") regardless of the type of device and method, the reprography exception under EUCD Art 5.2(a) covers reproductions on a specific medium (paper), using a specific method ("any kind of photographic technique"), regardless of its purpose, which may be for professional, educational, private and other uses. This means that the reprography levies cover both private and professional uses.
Consequently, when it comes to analysing the impact of reprography levies, it is not relevant to make a distinction between private and professional uses, since both of them are subject to the payment of a levy. Against this background, it is also unnecessary to distinguish between sales of devices in the private and business sectors. The point is that copies are permitted by law in both the private and business spheres. The  -  unified  -  device and storage medium remuneration can therefore be justified both for sales to private persons and sales to business end users.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70. Where such undue payments arise, what percentage of trade do they affect? To what extent could a priori exemptions and/or ex post reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States help to remedy the situation?
Private copy: see our answer to question 68.
In the field of reprography we refer to our response to question 69, which, in short, states that, under EUCD Article 5.2(a), text and image levies also covers professional uses. Q 70 therefore becomes irrelevant in relation to text and image levies. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?
A main problem is the tendency to mix private copying levies and reprography levies, and to argue the reprography levy as if it were identical to private copy levies. This is not the case; the two levy schemes are different (see question 69). The EU could contribute to clarification through sensitising EC officials and EU policy makers and institutions that reprography and private levies are different, and ensure consistency in their dealing with the two different levy schemes. 
Also, as mentioned under Q 68, it should be considered to what extent the handling of cases of export could be facilitated by a central European agency, and the obligation for exporters to pay the levy according to the rules of the country of destination should be regulated.

Generally speaking the Austrian publishing houses try their best to have an amicable adjustment with their athours. In other words, contract-based copyright protection is a system that is "rooted in everyday life". 
To be emphasised here is the strong will to cooperate by which the interest groups in the Austrian book trade  -  i.e. authors and publishers  -  on the one hand, and collecting societies, on the other hand, are led: For many decades they have joined forces to promote copyright protection and strengthen its legislative basis. There is no desire to have EU regulations govern the contractual framework of copyright or lay down preconditions.
Audiovisual literary works: For audiovisual authors it sees to be somehow more difficult. Especially through the contractual practices of broadcasting organisations audiovisual authors are forced, because of their weak bargaining position, to assign all their rights and receive a one-off fee with no further payments linked to the exploitation of the work, except for collectively managed rights such as cable retransmission and private copying. Therefore Literar-Mechana fully supports the submission of SAA (Society of Audiovisual Authors) who proposes to by-pass these unfair contractual practices and to develop a sustainable remuneration system which would secure audiovisual authors' remuneration for their making available right.
Generally speaking the distribution models of the collecting societies ensure that collected monies are properly channelled to the various groups of rightholders. 
VI. RESPECT FOR RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
A right that cannot be enforced deteriorates into a right that exists on paper only. The Internet is no parallel environment to the real world, and a state which regards the rule of law as the prevailing principle must provide for the possibility to assess, and implement, one's right to property. 
The scope of the question and clarifications of the civil enforcement system in the EU should not be limited to infringements committed `with a commercial purpose'. All infringements should be punished. The only difference being that sanctions will be larger for commercial purpose infringements.
Wider legal access to works can only be achieved through appropriate mechanisms which include direct licensing by authors and publishers and collective management of rights, combined with financial incentives, protection against infringement and copyright enforcement, including efficient combating of piracy and other forms of unauthorised reproduction. CMOs play an indispensable role in assisting authors and publishers to enable wider legal access to their works and in awareness raising and enforcement of rights.
Illegal copies exist of about 60% of the best-selling buch.de E-books. According to the Gutenberg 3.4 Ebook Piracy Report there are already ten illegal books to every legally purchased copy. „All you can read" is the slogan one of big Internet portals is using since October 2013. It offers a quarterly 10-euro flatrate fee for books  -  obviously with much success. Download figures have gone down, though. Still, the number of illegally accessed books in October alone amounted to more tan 1.8 millions. In fact illegal Internet portals like "TorBoox" and others are growing rapidly. They offer almost 45,000 titles, many of them best-sellers on the current lists. 
A study launched in 2005 with LEK Consulting by the Motion Picture Association of America showed that piracy-caused losses in Austria amounted to 16.5 million euros in the studied period. This figure is here exemplified by a number of Austrian films and their illegal distribution via kino.to or movie2k.to (kino.to went offline in June 2011): Wüstenblume: 101,000 calls;  Das weiße Band: 35,700 calls, Hexe Lilli 2: 109,000 calls (movie2k.to plus kinox.to), Die unabsichtliche Entführung der Frau Elfriede Ott: 35,021 calls (presently available on movie2k.to). During the first days after Michael Haneke's film „Amour" had been screened in Cannes in 2012, more than 80,000 copies were illegally drawn over the Internet and viewed in illegal downloads.  
However, anti-piracy measures by the legislation do show results: In 2010 Sweden examined the Internet traffic over a period of nine months, starting before, and ending, after a law amendment for the improvement of prosecution or Internet copyright infringements became effective. When the reformed law became applicable, the number of physical sales of music went up by 27 % and that of digital music sales by 48 %.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?
Collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to address copyright infringement and enforcement issues is welcome. The Commission could facilitate initiatives in this respect through financial contributions to awareness-raising campaigns. The use of filtering technologies by ISPs and others as well as systems to inform about authorised use (e.g. through search engines using the ACAP) are highly welcome and should be encouraged. These are mechanisms which help in enforcing contractual terms and preventing the networks from being used to infringe intellectual property. 
The Commission should also encourage the investment in new business models. The establishment of a sustainable legal offer, reflecting the cultural diversity of the European written sector, can only take place in an environment ensuring the full respect of copyright and, therefore, the  -  financial  -  independence of creators. Against this background, we request that the Commission maintains a stable and predictable legal framework, promoting its rationale and its enforcement by all players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved between the right to have one's copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of private life and protection of personal data?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO  -  Please explain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
The right balance of protection of copyright with other fundamental rights, such as privacy and protection of personal data, needs to be found on the basis of the principle of proportionality, in the discretion of Member States (see the case LSG-Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten GmbH v Tele2 Telecommunication GmbH (C-557/07)). 
A first and essential step in the right direction would be to clarify the role of Internet service providers in this context. To limit efforts to the issue of whether or not commercial purposes are aimed at, will not satisfy the needs of rightholders. In a so quickly changing environment it would be extremely difficult to tie rights protection to the issue of commercial or non-commercial purposes. 
A SINGLE EU COPYRIGHT TITLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X NO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ NO OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
In respect of the copyright legal framework, the EU should continue to pursue a pragmatic approach. Rather than emphasising on a single EU Copyright Title, the focus should be on the adoption of an overall intellectual property (IP) strategy. 
On the world stage, Austria has positioned itself as a country of arts and culture and, guided by the self-imposed image, claims a role of international importance which, by far, outranges its size in terms of geographical extension, economy and number of inhabitants. Nevertheless this definition as a nation deeply rooted in culture is of political and social relevance and of particular affect on tourism or Austria's representation in the international community of nations. 
If this well-established role and successful concept be maintained into future times, Austria must ensure the proper conditions under which the present and coming generations of artists are able to live and work, and provide them with a setting that secures their existence as creators of works of art. Unfortunately, lacking understanding for the idea of the artist's intellectual property, an ignorant position vis-à-vis the laws and their application as well as the influence of new technologies have caused a situation in which the described core conditions for artistic activities are no longer given. We are convinced that a national copyright law, shaped to the particular needs of the Austrian scene (a small country with a long cultural tradition) is the only solution to the problem. 
In 2008 about 10% of Austrian businesses were part of the country's creative industries. In that year the creative industries ensured employment of about 127,000 people in some 36,100 businesses.The 2008 revenues generated by companies in the creative industries amounted to 18.5 billion approximately, with gross value added amounting to about 7.2 billion euros. This corresponds to about 2.6 % of turnovers, and 3.5 % of added value, in the Austrian economy as a whole.    
Work on a single EU Copyright Title would require substantial resources and unnecessarily distract focus from the important work on an overall EU IP strategy. Also, it is difficult to see how it could be established on the basis of Article 118 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU). The different traditions and systems, which include both common and civil law practices benefit from being maintained. Even if sufficient unanimity should be reached amongst EU Member States as to the nature of EU copyright legislation, it is difficult to see that an overarching EU Copyright Title is required.
In our opinion there is no need for a single Copyright Law. In their totality, the existing regulations and therein contained exceptions and limitations meet all the requirements for solutions that serve the current needs of national and multinational users, be it on the basis of contractual agreements between users and rightholders or on that of agreements between collecting societies.
