Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright and rules
67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject to levies?
More transparency for consumers is often recommended, but in practice consumers are already faced with a vast amount of information when making their purchase. There is already a huge amount of existing information on receipts, invoices, manuals, contracts etc. Providing even more data on receipts and invoices will not educate consumers, but rather create an information overload.
71. If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved? [Open question] 

A. The current levy system in Europe is applied in an arbitrary manner, divorced from any substantiated economic data and as a result difficult to square predictability and the rule of law. 

This is clearly illustrated by massive divergence of tariffs across Europe and the significant increase in claims. For example the difference in tariff on a single device across the EU can vary anywhere between 1% - 10% of the purchase price, as documented by WIPO's International survey on private copying. Across the Single Market, levies collected per capita vary immensely are for instance over one hundred times higher in France than in Romania. This does not provide for a level playing field among business operators on the internal market and puts certain EU-member states' consumers at a disadvantage. 

Even allowing for some differences between consumer behaviors in different Member States, it seems difficult to reconcile these examples with a legally and economically sound application of levies. 
Indeed academic literature on levies acknowledges this arbitrariness, as expressed by Prof. Towse: "the copyright levy [...] has been almost universally opposed by economists on the grounds that its remuneration to creators bears no resemblance to the market value of the works and therefore could not act as a valid incentive to creators". The UK and Ireland have shown that without the exception, rights-holders have not experienced any economic harm. On the contrary, the UK market is one the most developed markets of content in the world. 


B. We believe the best way for copyright policy to promote cultural diversity is to allow digital services to grow and creators to be rewarded through the exercise of their exclusive rights. 

The problem is that the blunt application of levies clearly threatens to undermine the digital growth of the creative sector: efforts to develop new, attractive legal offers are met with calls for the payment of more compensation. This acts as a simple, effective deterrent to the development of new services across the EU.

We stress the benefits that online offerings are yielding for cultural diversity. A broader diversity of creative content is being produced in Europe than ever before. The number of books published in Europe has grown by close to 80% between 1995 and 2011.  The annual release of new music albums has increased significantly since 2000, the share of independently produced records has grown and the number of artists achieving commercial success has also increased.  Between 2005 and 2009, the number of films produced in a year in Europe rose from 890 to just under 1150.  
Revenues are also growing. From 2001 to 2011, all growth in the creative sector was generated by digital (30bn Euros).  
In the music sector, according to PwC (2012), global spending on digital music will surpass psychical distribution in 2015, as is already the case for the UK, the US, Sweden and South Korea.  iTunes reached the milestone of 25 billion songs sold in 2012. Deezer has 30 million users, including 4 million paying subscribers and Spotify over 24 million active users, and 6 million paying subscribers. Contrary to some views, the Internet has not diminished the appetite for paid content, and new online services are reducing piracy.  Between 2001 and 2011, consumer spending on creative content in Europe rose by 25%. 

The current levy system acts as a hindrance to the development of these opportunities. It hinders innovation and is detrimental to creators and EU citizens alike, having become an obstacle to the function of copyright to fund and support creators. Alternative and transparent models must also be explored in terms of providing funding for national cultural purposes.

C. Challenges of the Swedish levy system.

The current Swedish regulation of levies basically gives the collecting body, Copyswede, a right to freely (i.e. at will) impose new levies or raise tariffs. There is no impartial board or agency or governmental body that facilitates negotiations, and Copyswede does not need to motivate any new claims. 

This is a major problem for manufacturers and retailers since they have no other choice than taking the matter to a civil court in order to oppose new claims that are perceived as unfair. Since concerned manufacturers and retailers are typically in a disadvantaged position with regard to knowledge of the levy system and of the relevant regulation, compared to Copyswede, they tend to avoid costly court procedures and accept the economic loss of new levies (or raised levies) even though they are convinced that levies are wrong or misplaced.  

A possible solution would be to oblige Member States that have implemented levy systems to guarantee that an impartial, governmental board or the like, on the grounds of consumer surveys or the equivalent, determines whether or not levies should be imposed or removed and sets out the levy tariffs in accordance with the amount of private copying occurring in the market place.

Yet another possible solution would be to dismantle the device-based levy-system in favor of a State fund system, similar to ones created in Norway or Spain. Such a dismantlement would be justified by objective facts like the high administrative cost of the levy system (a rough estimate for 2012 is an administrative cost of 26 MSEK to collect 86.3MSEK of levies) and the sharp decline of traditional private copying triggered by the functioning of new online media services, where unauthorized private copying is non-existent. 

D. Shift of liability.

Transferring the responsibility of paying private copying levies  -  from manufacturer to retailer  -  would not entail foreseeable positive change, but would have considerable negative consequences for retail companies. 

Today, the situation is that a few global manufacturers are the principal financiers of the levies. If the responsibility of paying private copying levies would be transferred to retail, it would instead incur the administrative burden of paying levies on a very large number of small retail companies. In Sweden (and in the EU) approximately 99 % of all retailers are SMEs who obviously lack the administrative resources that multinational manufacturers can mobilise. 

In addition, the proposal to shift the responsibility of paying private copying levies to retailers would likely have negative consequences on the possibility of maintaining a level playing field among different businesses in the retail sector. The lion's share of retailers would obviously try to follow the rules. However, the difficulty of maintaining effective surveillance of the large number of companies would mean that the requirement to pay private copying levies would not always be observed by less informed SMEs or by rouge traders. As far as Swedish Trade Federation knows, it is mainly (perhaps exclusively) non-European ICT companies that are working for the proposed shift of liability. It is difficult to see how anything other than business strategic considerations and ambition to reduce costs could motivate their advocacy. 

Swedish retail selling electronic goods (the sector of retail that would be most affected by a shift of liability) has for a long time been under extreme competition, diminishing margins and even bankruptcies among the large national retail chains. In this business climate it would be detrimental to many companies if they were to be liable to pay a levy that they would not, due to harsh competition, be able to pass on to consumers.  In addition shifting the current liability regime would increase the overall administrative cost of levies for the European business community as a whole.
