    II.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law1.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management2 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services3; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”4 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the Linked
Content Coalition5.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability6.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

   Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
3
   Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term7
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
         - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
Italian record labels are always engaged in making as much music available to
EU consumers as possible through the most consumer friendly models. With a
huge variety of different services providing over 37 million recordings across
the EU we believe it is arguably the best and most advanced digital content
business in Europe. As part of this, record companies, including the Italian
labels usually grant EU-wide cross-border licenses and indeed in some cases
worldwide licenses. Record companies encourage services to launch as soon
as possible and in as many countries as possible – our business model is to
make our content available to as many customers as possible. Digital music
services are available everywhere in Europe.
As explained during the European Commission’s “Licences for Europe”
initiative and its working groups, over the last years, the music industry has
revolutionized itself under the current framework, and Europe is becoming a
key creative centre for the music business globally. The European digital

music market has grown considerably in the past few years (from €200 million
in 2004 to €1.2 billion in 2012), and increased significantly in its variety.
Digital music services in Europe have achieved incredible scale in a short
period, offering over 37 million tracks to all European consumers, and
repertoire continues to grow. Now there are 267 digital music services
available in Europe, ranging from pay-per-transaction services to subscription
services, including freemium ad-supported services. Five major music services
– iTunes, Deezer, 7Digital, Youtube, MySpace – are already available
everywhere in Europe. Spotify is available in 25 European countries, and other
services are available everywhere or almost everywhere in Europe too:
XBoxMusic is rolling out in all 28 countries, Rara in 20 countries, eMusic in 25
countries, GooglePlay in 15 countries. In fact, many of the leading online and
digital services, such as Spotify, Deezer, Last.FM, 7digital, are European
success stories. These services have developed on the basis of the existing
copyright framework and the multi-territory licences given by the right holders.
Music services are portable across borders, allowing subscribers to streaming
services to travel with full access to their service, and to consult services and
playlists in other countries.
However, despite the progress of new digital service business models, the
biggest obstacle to the development of services online is online piracy. Piracy
makes it extremely difficult for digital music services and start-ups to break
into countries where piracy is prevalent, and to develop their business in those
countries.

3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
Italian record companies are regularly asked and they regularly grant, directly
or via collective management organizations representing their rights, EU-wide
cross-border licences for the rights of sound recordings and in some case
even world-wide licences, either directly or via collective management
organizations representing their rights. However, many services elect to roll
out on a gradual country-by-country basis, in order to adapt to local conditions
and consumers’ needs and preferences. They often, therefore, do not want a
multi-territory licence, although they are also glad to know that when they
expand, licensing is in place to facilitate their work.
Copyright is not an issue. The practice shows that many digital platforms elect
to roll out services on a gradual country by country basis, for commercial
reasons, and to adapt their services to consumers’ needs and tastes in each

                                                                                            6
country. Many non-copyright factors are also involved in the development of
services across borders, and require considerable investment, such as
negotiating deals with local operators, including ISPs, mobile networks,
advertisers, payment providers etc.
Even large companies with significant resources such as Apple and Google
have staggered their roll outs. Like any business, digital services need to
manage their growth, and there are a number of business reasons for this,
which include trying out new business models (which requires time and
considerable resources), high infrastructure costs (setting up local offices,
marketing and communication), and a need for a local presence to provide
locally targeted editorial content in the national language. Furthermore, they
need to set up distribution, reporting and payment systems. A key factor
mentioned for the success of online services is the proximity to local
consumers. Indeed, some services only look to service specific national
audiences (such as BelgianMusic, WIMP, Cubomusica in Italy). A rushed
launch with insufficient local presence and marketing, without testing market
reactions, can severely damage a service or even destroy its chances.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]
If a service chooses to roll-out on a country-by-country basis, as explained in
our response to Q3, this not due to copyright, but to a strategy that reflects the
diversity of European culture and markets. The crucial problem – online piracy
– should be addressed by applying more efficient enforcement measures and
remedies (see our responses to Questions 75 and 76).
In addition, the record industry continues to provide various information tools
which help to raise awareness regarding legal services available across
Europe. During the European Commission’s “Licences for Europe” initiative
IFPI presented its Pro Music website www.pro-music.org which provides up to
date information about legal music services available across Europe, which
helps to navigate through music offers in all countries including Italy.


5.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
Record companies’ objective is to make repertoire available in all markets
where they have rights to do so. There is no reason for record companies to
withhold rights to certain content. The only reason why rights might not be
granted is if the companies do not hold rights in certain countries. The fact that
rights are territorially defined should not be regarded as territorial restrictions.

                                                                                           7
As explained above, Italian companies license rights on a multi-territory,
sometimes worldwide, basis.

6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?

7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
The widespread availability of licensed music content across the EU is already
a reality, no legislative changes are necessary. The music industry is one of
the most advanced digital content businesses in Europe.
The European copyright system is based on rights granted to right holders in
each Member State, but this does not preclude the licensing of rights on a pan-
European basis and the growth of legal services across Europe, as explained
in our response to Question 3. Successful digital music services have been
built on the current EU copyright framework, which shows that the system is
able to foster and support the growth of the digital economy in the EU.
Changing this framework without clear evidence of the need to do so, and
without proof of any actual benefit to the market, would create major
uncertainty and would prejudice the continued growth and viability of digital
services.

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC8 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software9 and databases10.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders11 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies12, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks13. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public14. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online

   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,

matter”.

in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of

country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
approach15)

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief16)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
We are not aware of any reasons why changes would be necessary, and
neither are there any reasons to believe that any changes would have a
positive effect on the market. On the contrary, changes to the territorial scope
of the “making available” right such as a “country of origin” approach, or
“targeting” approach, would negatively affect music rights, both from an
enforcement and a licensing perspective.
As explained in our response to Question 8, there is no need to clarify the
territorial scope of the “making available” right, which is derived from
international treaties as well as European law. The rights of record producers,
including the right of making available, are frequently licensed on a multi-
territory basis, and we have not encountered practical difficulties due to
possible differences existing in national rules on authorship/ownership or
transfer of rights.
As regards enforcement of rights, as a matter of practice, litigation can take
place where the infringing act occurs, i.e. in the country where the server is
located (where the act of uploading takes place), and in every country where
the server / service is accessed by members of the public. In many cases,
national courts confirmed that the act of making available covered both

15
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
16
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

“upstream” and “downstream” activities, confirming that making available
occurs in the country where the server is located, and in every country where
the server/service is accessed. The introduction of either a so-called “country-
of-origin” principle or an “exploitation/targeted public” principle through EU-
wide legislation would be contrary to these principles and would interfere with
the enforcement of producers’ rights, limiting the ability to bring infringement
proceedings against illegal services. This negative effect would be all the more
prejudicial in the absence of availability of cross-border injunctions.
The introduction of a so-called “country-of-origin” principle for online licensing
would lead to forum-shopping for the acquisition of rights, as also concluded
in the Commission’s Study on the Application of the Information Society
Directive (p. 182 of the Study), and would not produce any improvement over
the current situation, where digital services and content are already available
across Europe. The “exploitation/targeted public” principle could be difficult to
define due to the lack of objective criteria to define the concept of
“exploitation” and “the target of that exploitation”, which, in practice, would be
defined on a case-by-case basis, and this could lead to a lot of uncertainty for
both right holders and consumers.
     NO
     NO OPINION

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?
        – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

The market solves the licensing of rights adequately, and it will continue to be
allowed to provide pragmatic solutions.

3.        Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU17 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU18 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why.
The provision of a hyperlink should, al least in certain circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the right holders. This was confirmed by the
CJEU in the Svensson case (C-466/12). The Svensson decision also confirms
that authorisation for linking does not extent to links to copies that have been
made available without the permission of the right holders. For instance,
linking to a copy that was made available by a third party without the consent
of the right holder would clearly violate the right of communication to the
public.
The Svensson decision also means that authorisation for linking does not
extend to links to copies that have been made available without the permission
of the right holders. For instance, linking to a copy that was made available by
a third party without the consent of the right holder would clearly violate the
right of communication to the public.
There have been several cases at national level on the issue of linking and on
the scope of the communication to the public right. These cases should be
taken into account. For instance, in Twentieth Century Fox v Newzbin ([2010]
EWHC 608) the UK High Court considered, in relation to unlicensed index site
“Newzbin”, that the operators of the site made available films to the public
through their index site. The same ruling was given in Paramount Home
Entertainment International Ltd v BSB Ltd [2013] EWHC 3479 (Ch) where the
court applied the findings of “Newzbin” to a number of further websites that
provide links to infringing content hosted by third party websites. In addition to
the provision of links, these websites typically categorise and moderate the
links to content and make it searchable.
One additional criterion taken into account by the court is whether the content
was made available to a “new” public or audience (see above, Newzbin case;
CJEU Premier League C-403/08). Another scenario addressed by German
courts involves unlicensed cyberlockers and referrer sites: The Hamburg High
Court ruled against cyberlocker Rapidshare, in a case initiated by authors’
collecting society GEMA (Hamburg High Court, 14 March 2012, No. 5 U 87/09 –
not repealed by Federal Court of Justice) and found that the making available
of the works in question occurred the moment a link to the work hosted on the
cyberlocker servers was published, for instance, on an external linking site.

An additional example is piracy via BitTorrent where illegal content is accessed
via links that direct users to the location where they can access content. Many
significant pirate services use the aggregation of links to infringing content in
order to operate and generate revenue. In these circumstances the very act of
linking – e.g., linking by someone whose object is to assist in the infringement
of copyright by systematically directing users to infringing copies – should
itself constitute an infringement of copyright.
The CJEU judgement in the Svensson case and other cases at national level
indicate that a broad definition of the communication to the public right should
be maintained. Otherwise right holders may be deprived of remedies against
these forms of piracy.
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
        Comment: the EU Copyright Directive Article 5.1 already provides that no
        authorisation is required for temporary reproduction (a) for transmission
        by an intermediary and (b) for lawful use. Under this clear statement of
        law, protection has been given to the right holders without inhibiting

4.      Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further

                                                                                                13
distribution of that tangible article)19. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)20. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples

14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
In the recorded music sector, the consequences of enabling the resale of
digital content would have disastrous consequences for the entire music
market. Digital files that are transmitted electronically are very different from,
and have different market impacts than, recordings sold in physical formats.
The notion that the exhaustion principle should apply to copies acquired by
means of digital transmissions in the same way that it applies to physical
copies ignores the many differences between the two kinds of copies and
between the two distribution processes.
Looking specifically at the music sector, the resale of used physical recordings
is in the following context: (1) the quality of these deteriorates with time, and
often due to wear and tear or mishandling, (2) purchasing an item at a used
record store requires travelling to the store and searching for a copy of the
phonograph record, and (3) the resale only concerns the original recording, not
copies of that recording21,
These issues do not apply to files that are available and transmitted online.



19
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
20
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
21
   Article 5.2(b) of the 2001 Copyright Directive makes it clear the making of private copies is not allowed for
commercial ends, therefore prohibiting any sale of the copies made.

                                                                                                              14
First, the quality of a digital file is by nature identical to that of the “original”
file, with the result that the file transmitted completely substitutes the original.
Second, because the resale of mp3 files or similar files actually involves the
making and transmission of a new copy, one cannot ensure that the person
who sells the used file is actually surrendering his or her own possession of a
copy. This means that a seller may well retain and continue to use a copy
(quite unlike the situation involving sales of used hard copies) or resell
multiple (unlimited) copies from a single copy. This risk is increased by the fact
that, in response to demands from consumers, music downloading services do
not use any technological protection measures to limit the number of copies
which can be made from an initial download. The application of “forward and
delete” rules would require technical solutions, but we are not aware of such
solutions at this stage that would be effective.
The adoption of “digital exhaustion” would severely affect online services, and
would strongly prejudice right holders who would not share in any of revenues
from sales of copies that have displaced sales of material, and creators would
find it more difficult to make a living and draw revenues from the sale of
original content.
It is worth noting that the consequences of enabling the resale of content by
means of digital transmissions have been analysed by the United States
Copyright Office in its Section 104 Report (2001) and, more recently, by a U.S.
federal court in Capitol Records v. ReDigi (2012), and the conclusions of both
the report and the decision stress the negative impact on the market for
creative works.
As the U.S. Copyright Office concluded in its Report (in language relied upon
by the court in Redigi, this quotation is from the Section 104 Report at pp. 82-
83): “Physical copies of works degrade with time and use, making used copies
less desirable than new ones. Digital information does not degrade, and can be
reproduced perfectly on a recipient’s computer. The ‘used’ copy is just as
desirable as (in fact, is indistinguishable from) a new copy of the same work.
Time, space, effort and cost no longer act as barriers to the movement of
copies, since digital copies can be transmitted nearly instantaneously
anywhere in the world with minimal effort and negligible cost. The need to
transport physical copies of works, which acts as a natural brake on the effect
of resale on the copyright owner’s market, no longer exists in the realm of
digital transmissions. The ability of such ‘used’ copies to compete for market
share with new copies is thus far greater in the digital world.”

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute22. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not

   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered23.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES


Identifiers, and information about ownership and rights are subject to market-
led solutions, on a global level and on a case by case basis, where a business
need arises, therefore the creation of an EU registration system is
unnecessary. A system imposed by legislation carries significant risks for the
market including additional administrative burdens, added infrastructure and IT
costs and potential conflict with existing market solutions.

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed24, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database25 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition26 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the

   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
24
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub27 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The need for identifiers is driven by the market which has provided solutions,
and will continue to do so in order to meet industry demands. In our view, the
European Commission can do two things in the immediate future:
(1) In cases where the foundational work needs to be put into place the
Commission can lead the way, often working with industry and other
stakeholders, such as with the Linked Content Coalition (LCC Framework,
http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org). IFPI supports the valuable work of the
Commission in this area and together with member companies is participating
in the process.
(2) Allow market activity to shape developments around database
interoperability. In some cases, industry alone can drive developments, as
with company databases and data quality improvements. In some instances a
partnership between industry and standards-setting bodies is more
appropriate: for example in the current plans to work with ISO on revising the
ISRC standard.

E.         Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention28 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain
As the representative of the Italian recording industry, our response focuses
on the term of protection for sound recordings.

The EU Term Extension Directive was only recently adopted after lengthy
consideration, and it came into force on the 1st November 2013. We therefore
question whether any re-assessment is appropriate at this stage.
The current EU term of 70 years from publication for performers and producers
in a sound recording was only recently increased to be more in-line with the
international trend. Many countries have 70 years and higher, with the US
having a 95 year term.
The 70-year term reflects the fact that performers are living longer.
Furthermore, the infinite nature of the internet means that a vast array of
repertoire can be made available in a way that was not possible in brick and
mortar stores. This created the opportunity for many performers to have a
second career as their older recordings are rediscovered by consumers. A 70-
year term for sound recordings ensures that artists are protected and can earn
remuneration later in life, which is why artists were such vocal supporters of
the extension to 70 years. Moreover, additional measures provided under the
EU law and national legislation ensure that artists get additional benefits and
remuneration from an extended term of protection.
A longer term of protection also benefits new artists, as income from copyright
is available to be re-invested in discovering, nurturing and promoting new
musical talent in Europe, ensuring continued cultural diversity as well as more
opportunities for young performers.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC29.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law30. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 31, these limitations and
29
   Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases; Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of
computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

   Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member
States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

                                                                                                            18
exceptions are often optional32, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")33.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
The exceptions in the EU Copyright legislation are drafted in a flexible way and
accommodate a large variety of digital uses. There is a degree of variation in
exceptions among the Member States due to their optional character, however,
in most cases these variations are of little or no practical consequence. This is
due to the fact that the main exceptions (for the disabled, libraries, education,

32
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
33
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19
press, quotation) have been implemented in all Member States. Also, many
exceptions (e.g. museums and prisons, repair of equipment, architectural
works, etc) have no cross-border impact.
  NO OPINION


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
As the Commission’s Study on the 2001 Information Society Directive notes,
exceptions are derogations from the rights of creators, and they need to be
applied and interpreted strictly. The potential need for making some or all
exceptions mandatory across Europe should therefore be duly justified and
quantified. The same applies to any further harmonisation. As mentioned under
Question 21, most exceptions are already implemented in all Member States,
and many of them do not even have any cross-border effects.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Existing exceptions already provide a large degree of flexibility and are able to
accommodate new uses online. For the rest, we believe that licensing solutions
are the most flexible and fastest way to accommodate new digital uses,
knowing that many of these uses have a commercial impact.
If any problems arise, the music industry has proven itself open to looking at
ways to ensure that the market can deliver pragmatic solutions for the benefit
of all parties. Before any new exceptions are considered, their necessity
(including why they would be preferable to licensing solutions) should be
proven on the basis of clear evidence and sound economic analysis. This
analysis should, in particular, look at the extent of the perceived need in terms
of quantity of potential users across Europe in relation to the impact on the
market, and for example whether there is any market failure which cannot be
fixed without changes to legislation. To date no such problem has been
identified.
One important example, user-generated content (UGC), has significant
commercial impact and value, and record companies have been licensing UGC
for some time. Record companies license platforms directly. The licences
given by the companies also enable the posting [embedding] of UGC by users
on their own blogs or websites, thereby extending the authorised uses beyond
the platforms themselves. The introduction of a new exception is not
necessary, and would deprive creators of revenues, without bringing any
                                                                                       20
benefit to the end-user. See also our responses to Questions 58-63 on User-
Generated Content.
Record companies also license small-scale users. As part of the “Licences for
Europe” process, IFPI created a new industry-led pan-European licensing
scheme, which will specifically target the needs of small-scale users, including
individuals, small associations and small businesses. The new scheme will
enable those users to obtain one-stop pan-European licences from record
producers collecting societies, allowing them to easily use recordings on their
websites. An exception for small-scale uses online could not be reduced to
non-prejudicial uses because it could not encompass the actual extent and
impact of the uses. Moreover, a use that is small-scale today may become
large-scale tomorrow.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The existing exceptions already provide for a large degree of flexibility.
Member States have room to implement exceptions in a focused manner,
where necessary. The CJEU provides interpretation of the EU-wide concepts.
More flexibility in the form of an open-ended exception would neither provide
legal certainty nor more harmonisation at EU level. We agree with the authors
of the Study On The Application of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and
Related Rights in the Information Society that the introduction of an open
“horizontal” exception or a “fair-use” kind of exception in the Directive
2001/29/EC, which would introduce flexibility to the list of exceptions, would
not be a good option because it will raise more questions and go beyond what
is necessary for “certain limited uses”, which is required under the three-step
test, and would have an adverse impact on the Internal Market because it is an
unfamiliar concept for copyright in most Member States (see pp. 534 – 539). We
think that the three-step test should remain the ultimate safety net for right
holders and it is the precondition for the flexibility of the scope of certain
exceptions listed in Directive 2001/29/EC.
  NO OPINION

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the

     NO OPINION


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Assuming that a particular act has an effect in more than one country and is
subject to an exception that requires compensation, compensation arising
from the harm suffered in each country should be paid to the person or entity
that holds the rights in that particular country, and should be paid by the
person whose acts caused the harm in that country.

A.       Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving34 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions35. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive36.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.       Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these

works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other

29.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
In our view, there is no need for any extension of the existing exceptions. If
problems exist, market-based solutions, such as new licensing schemes,
should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions are flexible and can
be implemented and adapted faster than legislation, and can then continue to
adapt to changing consumer habits and technology.


30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
There is no need for a legislative solution; see our response to Question 29.

31.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the most optimal solution; see our response to Question 29.

2.        Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements

                                                                                           23
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need for new exceptions or limitations, or for any extension of the
existing exceptions. If problems exist, market-based solutions, such as new
licensing schemes should be preferred whenever possible, as these solutions
are flexible and can be implemented and adapted faster than legislation.
Moreover, there is no need for such exceptions and limitations with respect to
music because access to music is already ubiquitous and readily available at
attractive conditions due to developments in the marketplace. The free-to-use
on-demand services (freemium) that are available, such as the ad-supported
versions of Spotify or Deezer, give instant access to all EU consumers to a
catalogue of 37 million tracks from all over Europe, enabling also research and
private study. Any extension of the existing exception in the field of music
regarding the online consultation is therefore unnecessary.


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
No need for a legislative solution; see our response to Question 33.

35.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Licensing is the most optimal solution; see our response to Question 33.




                                                                                          24
3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
     NO
The wide availability of digital music services, including in particular those
operating a “freemium” model means that any exception for e-lending is
unnecessary.
Moreover, e-lending by public institutions could interfere with legitimate music
services that are offered on the marketplace, providing the world repertoire in
various formats and at attractive conditions (including freemium models) and
having made significant investment. Unlicensed e-lending would provide users
with totally substitutable services which would prejudice the exploitation of
producers’ rights and would harm the digital services. Furthermore, unlike
physical copies of works, digital copies do not degrade with time and usage
and can be reproduced perfectly. As such the impact of a potential exception
would have a far greater economic impact than the traditional physical
schemes. These activities should be dealt with by the market place and should
be subject to licenses.
     NO OPINION

37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
As explained above, an exception for e-lending in the field of music would
directly harm the legal market. Any problems arising can, and must be solved
by licensing schemes.
The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?


                                                                                             25
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
It should be noted that when libraries get into the business of making works
available online, they are starting to compete in the areas traditionally
governed by the marketplace, and therefore there is much less justification for
exceptions and limitations.


4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other37. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)38.

40.     [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU

          You will find more information about his MoU on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
38
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             26

This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties. There is no

     NO OPINION

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC39 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?

43.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
There is no need to extend any existing exceptions.
We agree with the conclusions of the authors of the Commission’s Study on
the 2001 Information Society Directive that the exception for teaching and
research (art. 5.3(a)) is formulated openly, i.e. e-learning is included in the
scope of the exception. The Study points out that the issue is that some
implemented national laws show a restrictive transposition and diverging
conditions. We agree with the opinion expressed in the Study that the best
option to address and solve the divergences would be to require Member
States to meet the aims of the exception, especially when it concerns cross-
border teaching and research (pp. 402 – 403 of the Study).

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC41 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 42.

The Marrakesh Treaty43 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics44 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual

44
     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

                                                                                              30
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”45. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs46. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this

recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions47.

Record companies license UGC content to digital platforms. These licences
given to the platforms enable the users to post UGC content on these services,
and avoid the need for these users to seek individual licences. The licenses to
the platforms also enable the posting (embedding) by users of the UGC content
on their own blogs or websites for free. At the same time, the right holders,
including artists, are able to monetise their content.
Today, consumers enjoy creating content with a combination of images, text
and music content, often using somebody else’s pre-existing copyright
protected content. This is usually described as “User Generated Content”. In
practice, the greatest majority of UGC uses significant portions of pre-existing
works which are protected by copyright. For instance, users combine a
wedding video with a music track, or apply new lyrics to a popular music video.

User Generated Content (UGC) accounts for a significant proportion of the
content available on video streaming platforms. The record industry supports
and actively licences UGC platforms that make available new content based on
sound recordings and music videos created by the record labels. These
licences are provided on a cross-border basis. They are granted to the
platforms themselves, thereby avoiding the need for users who post content
including protected material to ask for individual licenses, and give the record
companies the possibility to monetise their content by sharing some of the
proceeds obtained by the licensed platforms from advertisements that appear

alongside the UGC. Today, a platform such as YouTube is an increasingly
important source of digital revenues for our industry, and UGC plays a large
role in this.
The licences given by the companies also enable the posting [embedding] of
UGC by users on their own blogs or websites, thereby extending the
authorised uses beyond the platforms themselves. This enables users who
wish to show their UGC on their own blogs and websites to do so by posting
the UGC on a licensed platform and then “embedding” the video on their blog
or website, which makes it appear that the video is coming from their site
although in fact it is coming from the UGC platform. This is beneficial to the
user, who can take advantage of user-friendly tools generally provided by the
platforms that are probably easier for most people to use than the tools they
would use to put the videos directly on their websites, and because the act of
‘making available’ the UGC – including the underlying right holder’s work –is
covered by the license to the platform. (It is also the method employed by
almost all users.) It is also beneficial to right holders because they are able to
exercise different options to monetise the content and the option to require
that the video be taken down if it is objectionable.
Protected recordings are identified by automatic content recognition
technology (such as YouTube’s Content ID and Audible Magic’s automated
content recognition system) and can be associated with the appropriate right
holder. This identification facilitates remuneration of the relevant right holders,
and enables them to demand, in a very small minority of cases, that particular
UGC – such as those which are offensive, or violate the moral rights of the
performers – be taken down.
In short, the companies are licensing the making available of UGC, providing a
legal environment for consumers, while preserving their right (and therefore
artists’ rights) to be compensated for uses of their copyright material when it
generates revenue for the platforms.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As explained above, the use of UGC is solved by licensing online platforms.
This provides a legal environment for consumers who make UGC available
online, while enabling right holders to monetise their content.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]

UGC is being handled successfully by licensing. On the contrary, some
proposals mentioned, such as an exception for UGC, would be highly
prejudicial.

We support the existing law which makes it clear that a user who uses another
person’s work requires, except in rare and rather narrowly defined cases, the
permission of the copyright holder. There is no reason to change the law in
that respect, especially when the right holders have relied on the law to enter
into licenses that facilitate the dissemination of UGC, while at the same time
respecting the economic and moral rights of creators.




                                                                                       35
In contrast, creating exceptions for UGC, as sometimes suggested, would
render the existing license system meaningless, and would deprive right
holders of the revenues they are currently obtaining. It would also fail to deal
with the issue of moral rights and the need to accommodate mechanisms for
addressing such issues, which are currently managed under the licensing
arrangements in place. The principal beneficiaries of an exception would not
be consumers, for whom nothing would change in comparison to the current
situation, but a number of big platforms which would be able to receive the
proceeds of advertising for UGC without paying any remuneration to the
owners of the content. This would result in a transfer of value from creators to
large technology companies.

We agree with the authors of the recently published Study On The Application
of Directive 2001/29/EC on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information
Society that was prepared for the Commission that there do not appear to be
“sufficient problems in practice to justify” a UGC specific exception (p. 542 of
the Study). They also note that there is reason to believe that another
legislative alternative to introduce more flexibility into the list of exceptions
“will practically give rise to more questions than it will answer and will lead to
increased litigation”, that it could well lead to “unexpected but undesired
results,” and that “it is likely that it would have an adverse impact on the
functioning of the Internal Market” (p. 541 of the Study).

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]

As we have explained, the market is accommodating the use of UGC. Users
who wish to disseminate UGC using pre-existing music may do so by making
their creations available through licensed platforms, which provide the benefit
of remunerating the performers and producers of the underlying works and
respecting the moral rights of the performers and, in relatively infrequent
cases, requiring the takedown of offensive UGC that incorporate pre-existing
recordings.

As mentioned above, if there is a lack of awareness from the consumers on the
existence of licences, this could be improved by better information from the
platforms.

     IV.       Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying48. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.

                                                                                             36
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees4950.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions51 in the digital environment?
          – Please explain
     NO – Please explain
Directive 2001/29/EC provides for clear exceptions for copyright and
reprography. The private copying exception, in particular, makes clear that the
exception is limited to individual, non-commercial uses, in return for fair
compensation. We are not aware of problems and case-law relating to the
actual scope of the exception, except for the issue of legal source, which will
be clarified by the CJEU in the near future.
     NO OPINION

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?52
     YES – Please explain
The music industry’s priority has always been to give licenses whenever
possible. However, today a large number of private copies continue to be made
from CDs or from online sources on digital devices and media such as mobile
phones, smart phones, MP3 players and PCs for reasons such as format
shifting or for the making of copies beyond licensed uses, or as a result of the
mandatory private copying exceptions in some countries, for instance, in
France or Belgium. For these copies, fair compensation must be provided as
foreseen under Article 5(2)b of Directive 2001/29/EC whenever a private
copying exception exists under national law.
The EU 2001/29 Directive provides clear criteria for the application of fair
compensation, some of which have been confirmed by the CJEU. The possible
harm to the right holders is only one of the possible criteria which can be taken

into account to evaluate the level of fair compensation. In this context, harm
includes the missed licensing opportunities for the right holders when copies
cannot be licensed. The Directive also states (Recital 35) that no levies are due
when the prejudice to the right holders would be minimal. There is no need to
clarify these points further in legislation.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
We do not blieve that levies impact the development of new online services,
including cloud services. A large variety of online services, some of which rely
on cloud technology such as Spotify, Deezer, iTunes Match, have developed in
the last years; more services are emerging, and we do not see levies interfering
with such development.
Cloud services in particular, involve for the largest majority the setting up of a
database and the making available of the copies to consumers. These activities
require a license from the right holders, and such licences have been granted
to services such as iTunes Match, AmazonMP3 and Google Play. Copies made
“in the cloud” with such services do not fall under the scope of private copying
and levies.
Conversely, we do not see how a diminution in levies would have any positive
impact on the development of legal services. As explained above, a reduction
of levies would only affect the revenues of the right holders for copies that are
anyway not able to license effectively.
67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?53
     YES – Please explain
The levy amount could appear on the invoice related to the sales of products
subject to levies. For full transparency and to avoid any misunderstandings,
such an indication should only be displayed if it is accompanied by a clear
explanation about the purpose of the levy (i.e. to compensate the right holders
for the copying of their creations). In addition to transparency, an advantage of
the visible levy would be to help enforce the joint liability of manufacturers,
importers and retailers within the sales chain, as each element of the chain
could verify that the levy has been paid upwards.

53
  This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies.

                                                                                                          38

     NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments54.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?
   YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Levies are not an obstacle to the free movement of goods and services. We are
not aware of cases of double payments. This is probably due to the fact that
the different EU countries have systems of exemptions or refund schemes in
the case of export or transit of products subject to levies.
The Opus judgment of the CJEU (case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs
Opus Supplies, 16 June 2011) recently clarified that, in cases of distant sales
occurring from one EU Member State to consumers located in another EU
Member State where a private copying exception and levies are in place, the
distant seller should be liable for the payment of the levy applicable in the
Member State where the consumer is located. Consequently, it is for the State
where right holders suffer from the harm caused by private copying to ensure
the effective recovery of the levy, irrespectively of whether the media retailer is
established in the same State or in another one.
This decision confirmed what is already applying in the offline environment. In
our view the export or exemption schemes can also be applied in the case of
online sales of equipment and devices in order to avoid any possible double
payments.

69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural

71.    If you have identified specific problems with the current functioning of the levy
system, how would these problems best be solved?
[Open question]
The CJEU has already clarified a number of important elements, in particular
the fact that levies are an adequate and legitimate way to compensate right
holders for the private copying of protected works, the application of levies in
the country of establishment of consumers, the liability of manufacturers for
the payment of levies. Another decision is expected shortly on the application
of legal source for the private copying exception. In our view, any further
issues, if they arise, can be solved by clarifications from the CJEU, or by
national legislation.



     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers55 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract56. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic

55
     See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).
56
     See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive 96/9/EC.

                                                                                           40
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The grant of exclusive rights to producers is essential to enable them to take
the significant financial investment risks they make in an industry where there
is no guarantee of success. Furthermore, this gives them the ability to enforce
those rights against infringing parties.
The best measure the EU can take to ensure that authors, producers and
performers are properly remunerated is to tackle piracy. The remuneration of
authors, performers and producers has been devastated by piracy. Sales of
music have halved as a direct consequence. In order to substantially increase
revenue for performers and authors the EU needs to provide adequate
legislation to enable producers and publishers, on behalf of performers and
authors, to fully tackle the piracy which has caused, and continues to cause,
so much damage to the industry.
Contractual freedom of all parties involved is and continues to be the best
mechanism for addressing remuneration of performers. The decline in revenue
over the last few years comes directly from the impact of piracy, not from the
contractual relationship between producer and performer.
The digital market has not offset the decline in physical sales caused by piracy,
so there is no additional revenue in the value chain.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
See the response to Question 72. Existing EU and national law, as well as
judicial precedents already provide protection against unfair contractual
practices. In the music sector the best guarantee for fair contractual practices
is the competitive pressure resulting from the fact that with new digital
production and distribution technologies the barrier to entry to the market is
very low. As a result of this competitive environment, companies that applied
unfair practices would simply disappear, as they wouldn’t be able to sign new
acts or retain old ones.
  NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
We believe that under the prevailing conditions a system that guarantees
contractual freedom is the best means to achieve fairness and fair contractual
practice. We do not believe that detailed rules interfering with the parties’
freedom to contract or introducing artificial restrictions upon the parties will
benefit anyone, as ultimately, they would reduce the production of new creative
content to the detriment of right holders and consumers.



     VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE57 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text58. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose59. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure60. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
The enforcement of IP rights should definitely be made more efficient on
several points. Directive 2004/48/EC was an important first step towards
harmonising measures and procedures for civil enforcement in Europe.
However, with the further rapid development of Internet technology, the
Directive has now become inadequate to address the main forms of copyright
infringement online, which in the majority of cases involve a cross-border
element as internet sites are available in more than one country, and it does
not provide effective remedies for right holders.


57
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.

   You will find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm
59
   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.
60
   This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                           42
IFPI estimates, based on measurement data, that around 25% of internet users
in Europe regularly access unlicensed services offering music content.
Europe’s average matches the global level, although some EU countries have
significantly higher piracy rates. Unlicensed operations act as unfair
competition to legitimate digital services as well as high street music retailers
(many of which are EU-based). EU-based companies such as Deezer, Spotify
and WiMP have led the growth in streaming services in Europe and globally,
but face significant challenges in further expanding their premium offerings
when unlicensed free services are widespread. Piracy also limits consumer
engagement with the many free ad-supported services, limiting the advertising
revenues of legal services and thus harming their commercial viability.
Piracy is widely acknowledged as a dampening force on new services
launching, especially in countries with low enforcement and high piracy. For
example, when iTunes launched in Poland, the late Steve Jobs said that
iTunes’ biggest competitor was piracy rather than other legal services, a
thought        shared         by       other        licensed    companies.
(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3805565.stm).
Digital piracy has both a direct and an indirect negative impact. It directly
impacts sales: the majority of academic and empirical studies conclude that
piracy negatively impacts the demand for licensed content (see, for example,
Smith/Telang’s “Assessing the Academic Literature Regarding the Impact of
Media Piracy on Sales” (2012)). In addition, there is a knock-on impact on the
development of the legitimate online market as a whole and the ability of
record companies to invest in music production and local repertoire, as well as
in new artists. Tera Consultancy’s March 2010 study “Building a Digital
Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU’s Creative Industries”
(“Tera Study”), found that in 2008, the EU’s creative industries that were most
impacted by piracy (film, TV series, recorded music and software) experienced
retail revenue losses of €10 billion and losses of more than 185,000 jobs due to
piracy.
Directive 2004/48/EC needs to be revised to deal with these problems, in
particular with respect to the following aspects:
- Cross-border injunctions should be introduced. Online piracy cases typically
involve a cross-border element with sites and services available in more than
one country, or having connections (e.g. operators, ISPs) with multiple
jurisdictions. Often, right holders are required to take multiple actions against
the same infringing service (e.g. The Pirate Bay), and there is currently no
procedure to enable claims in different countries to be consolidated in one
jurisdiction. One option to remedy this situation is to allow an injunction
against a specific service obtained in one Member State to be enforced in
another Member State, either directly or by way of an expedited procedure.
- Article 8(3) of the Directive 2001/29/EC (which corresponds to Article 11 of the
Directive 2004/48/EE) should be properly implemented in all EU Member States.
Article 8(3) is not properly implemented in countries such as Germany, Poland,
Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Sweden. This article allows in
particular to obtain injunctions to require internet access providers to stop
providing access to infringing websites, and in November 2013 the Advocate
General of the European Court of Justice confirmed that this form of injunction

                                                                               43
is available under Article 8(3) and is not incompatible with fundamental rights.
In countries where Article 8(3) is implemented right holders have been
successful in obtaining injunctions against access providers (e.g. UK, Italy,
Ireland, Belgium, Finland and Denmark). However, in many countries these
procedures take significant time and right holders incur high costs in pursuing
the cases with infringing websites and services remaining accessible in the
meantime, causing significant harm to the right holders. We therefore believe
that the current legislative framework could be improved in national
jurisdictions by providing for faster and more efficient procedures, ideally
enabling right holders to obtain injunctions in respect of several sites in one
action. It is currently not possible to obtain such a relief in all countries where
Article 8(3) is implemented. Also, the EU legislative framework should take into
account the cross-border nature of online piracy. For instance, there should be
regulation to allow an injunction against services/intermediaries obtained in
one Member State to be enforced against other services/intermediaries in
another Member State, either directly or by way of an expedited court
procedure.


- Provisions on injunctive relief should be improved in order to cover
subsequent IP/DNS addresses of infringing websites. For instance, The Pirate
Bay has changed domain names and registrations and IP addresses a number
of times over the course of 2013 in ongoing efforts to circumvent the block in
certain countries where the orders obtained did not cover changes of domain
or IP addresses for the sites.. It should also be guaranteed that obtaining a
catalogue-wide injunctive relief is for current and future catalogue is not
rendered unreasonably onerous or practically unworkable due to the number
of infringements that must be proved by a right holder in order to obtain such
relief.
- Provisions on damages as provided in the Directive 2004/48/EE should be
improved to achieve their purpose: (i) right holders have to be adequately
compensated for the loss suffered, and (ii) infringers (and other potential
infringers) have to be deterred by applying sufficiently significant damages.

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]

The current legal framework is not clear enough in allowing for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries. The recording industry believes that all

                                                                                      44
intermediaries such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc. in the digital economy
have a responsibility to cooperate in order to support legitimate digital
commerce and fight piracy. We therefore suggest improving the following
measures:

- Cooperation required from all intermediaries. All intermediaries in the online
environment (search engines, advertisers and payment providers) should
contribute to curb piracy online. The EU legislative framework should consider
that all intermediaries play an important role when it comes to online piracy,
which means they bear certain responsibilities in tackling the problem.
Examples of what this should include are as follows: (a) search engines should
stop directing consumers to infringing content or services but in any event
should change their prioritisation criteria (by promoting legal services and
significantly demoting pirate sites where a reasonable volume of infringement
notices are sent); (b) advertisers/ad networks should stop serving
advertisements to infringing sites that make substantial sums from unlicensed
content; (c) payment providers should be required to stop providing payment
services to illegal sites and services; and (d) App stores should remove Apps
which are designed to facilitate piracy.

- Protection against liability only for truly neutral intermediaries. Protection
against liability under the E-Commerce safe harbour regime should only apply
to “truly neutral intermediaries”. The most serious problem right holders
encounter with notice and action is that many of the platforms and services
seeking to take advantage of the safe harbours in Article 14 are not properly
within the definition of hosting service providers, nor are they true
intermediaries (e.g. unlicensed locker services and BitTorrent sites). Many of
these services are structurally infringing sites, enabling the wide dissemination
of unauthorised content, and whose business model depends on right holders
not being able to locate and notify infringing URLs fast enough before they are
re-posted. However, according to ECJ case law and the EU legislative
framework, protection against liability can only granted to “merely technical,
automatic and passive” services. This should therefore be clarified further.

- Requirement for ISPs to keep public databases updated. ISPs should be
required to keep public databases (e.g. Domain Tools, RIPE) updated to allow
right holders to identify which ISP is providing internet service. The vast bulk
of the online piracy problem originates from sites and services for which there
is no identified corporate entity or individual against whom civil litigation can
be taken. The difficulties which right holders face – beyond the above
mentioned lack of a legal method to obtain the details – are (1) incorrect or fake
details, or even no details displayed on public databases such as the RIPE
database or Domain Tools, and (2) incorrect or fake details held by ISPs. In
addition, sites move from one ISP to another very quickly in order to evade
enforcement. Unless ISPs are required to keep public databases accurate and
up to date, right holders are deprived of any means of identifying the persons
responsible for the infringing services.



                                                                               45
77. Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection
of private life and protection of personal data?
  YES – Please explain
The balance between copyright enforcement and protection of private life and
personal data has extensively been addressed in case law (e.g. Promusicae)
and in underlying legislation.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

   78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
   of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
   EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO


We do not see what benefits a single EU Copyright Title would provide, and
how it could be put in practice. A single EU Title makes sense in the field of
rights which are obtained on the basis of a registration (such as patents or
trademarks). The very nature of those industrial property rights is different
from copyright, as their protection itself depends on the registration system,
which includes the examination of the subject matter (e.g. a sign, or an
invention) to be protected. For these rights, a single title is an alternative to
long and expensive multiple registration procedures in individual Member
States.
Copyright is inherently different as its existence is not based on a registration
procedure and arises from the mere creation of a work. If a single EU copyright
title was introduced as an optional system to be applied on the top of national
copyright systems, we do not think that it would be adopted, because it would
duplicate the protection which already exists at national level and across
Europe. On the other hand, if such a title was mandatory, this would require a


                                                                                           46
full harmonisation of copyright throughout the EU, which is neither necessary
nor achievable.


   79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
       current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
       longer term project?
[Open question]
The core legal framework underlying the online music market, in particular
Directive 2001/29/EC which sets out the necessary rights and the protection of
technology in the digital environment, is generally satisfactory, and is
sufficiently harmonised at EU level. It provides an acceptable degree of legal
certainty as well as flexibility for the future. Efforts should concentrate on the
proper implementation and enforcement of this vital framework.




VIII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]

One area in which the EU could have an immediate and positive impact on the
copyright sectors would be to introduce a system of tax credits to assist with
the discovery, development and production costs of new artists. A tax credit
system would incentivise companies to take additional risks on new European
talent, would boost cultural diversity, and lead to more investment in talent at a
local level, all the while boosting the European economy. For example, Italy
implemented a tax credit scheme for record companies in 2013.

Another important issue is to extend reduced VAT rates for the cultural sectors
to cover recorded music, which currently does not benefit from the reduced
rates that other sectors do. Additionally, extending the reduced VAT rates to
both online and offline products is important, as the product consumed is the
same: music. Reduced and harmonised VAT rates would lead to more
consumer interest in purchasing music (at lower prices) and would be a way of
promoting Europe’s culture. It would also bring the music sector in line with
other creative and cultural sectors.
