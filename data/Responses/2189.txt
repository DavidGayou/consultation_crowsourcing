   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples

€ NO


€ NO OPINION





   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


X YES


The new directive on collective rights management seeks  to  promote  multi-
territorial  licensing  through  a  ‘passport  system’  that   would   offer
incentives to a small number of (larger) CMO’s  to  offer  multi-territorial
licenses. While the effectiveness of the proposed system is  speculative  at
best,  it  only  applies  to  the  music  sector.  The  problems  of  multi-
territorial licensing however appear everywhere  in  the  creative  economy,
and demand more rigorous solutions. For  example,  the  1993  Satellite  and
Cable Directive’s ‘country of uplink’ rule could be  extended  to  apply  to
content services offered online.  A content  provider  wishing  to  offer  a
service to multiple countries in the EU would then need a license only  from
the MS where the provider is operating or duly established.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

X NO

The 1993 Satellite and Cable Directive’s ‘country of uplink’ rule  could  be
extended to apply to content services offered  online.  A  content  provider
wishing to offer a service to multiple countries in the EU would  then  need
a license only  from  the  MS  where  the  provider  is  operating  or  duly
established.




   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[1])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed

€ NO OPINION





  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


X YES


The Information Society Directive harmonizes the two main  economic  rights:
the rights of reproduction and of communication to the public.  Both  rights
are defined in very broad  terms  and  therefore  tend  to  overlap  in  the
digital environment these rights. This  has  led  to  legal  insecurity  for
right holders and users, and has made copyright clearance for  digital  uses
even more cumbersome and less transparent.


The  problem  of  overlapping  rights  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact   that
reproduction rights and communication rights are often managed by  different
CBO’s. As a result  content  providers,  such  as  digital  broadcasters  or
online content providers, are compelled  to  accept  multiple  licenses  for
what are effectively unitary acts  of  usage.  The  existing  limitation  on
transient and incidental copying only partly removes this overlap.


We therefore propose to revise the Information Society Directive  to  better
align the right of reproduction with  the  right  of  communication  to  the
public. Given that the right of making available was especially tailored  to
serve  as  the  primary  economic  right  involved  in   acts   of   digital
transmission,  it  would  make  sense  for  the  scope  of  the   right   of
reproduction to  be  reduced.  This  could  be  achieved  by  replacing  the
currently  technical  notion   of   reproduction   by   a   more   normative
interpretation  that  factors  in  the  economic   impact   of   a   digital
reproduction. If a technical copy has no economic  significance,  it  should
not count as reproduction. Part of this solution could  be  integrating  the
current  exception  for  transient  copying  into  the  definition  of   the
reproduction right.


Recalibration  of  the  reproduction  right  would  be  in  compliance  with
international treaties.  While  the  international  copyright  treaties  (in
particular the Berne Convention) do require contracting  states  to  provide
for a right of  reproduction,  the  treaties  do  not  define  reproduction,
leaving states a broad measure of discretion.


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount

      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

[Open question]

  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


X YES


See answer to Q. 16 (below).


  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


Various EU-funded projects aim at creating databases of reliable metadata
on copyright works. In the UK, the Hargreaves review recommended that
governments support creation of a digital copyright exchange (now renamed
“the Copyright Hub) designed to facilitate cheaper, faster and more
widespread licensing of “long tail” rights to small-scale rights users. EU
law could provide further incentives to make metadata publicly available,
for example by requiring that CMO’s permit public access to their metadata.
Another regulatory incentive could be to make the legal protection of DRM
conditional upon making metadata available to a designated entity. Yet
another would be a formal requirement for all right holders to submit
copyright metadata to this entity. Note that in the digital environment
such formal requirements would hardly be burdensome, and could probably be
automatically fulfilled.


The Berne Convention prohibits formal requirements, but only if the
enjoyment or exercise of copyright is subjected to formalities. This does
not preclude administrative requirements external to copyright, such as
existing systems of legal deposit. The Convention also does not preclude
subjecting the legal protection of DRM’s to formal requirements. A more
ambitious initiative aimed at the actual (re)introduction of substantive
copyright formalities would, however, require renegotiating the Berne
Convention.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


See answer to Q. 16 (above).


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


See answer to Q. 16 (above).





  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

X NO


Current terms of copyright and neighbouring (related) rights are
unwarranted and disproportionate, and impede economically valuable and
culturally important digital (re)uses of ‘old’ works. Major parts of our
European cultural heritage have been recently digitalized at great public
expense, but are not accessible online to the general public because of
excessive terms of copyright protection. In the EU copyright expires 70
years after the death of the (last surviving) author of a work. For the
neighbouring (related) rights of performing artists, broadcasting
organizations and film producers the  term is 50 years after publication;
the 2011 Term Extension Directive has extended this term for phonorecords
to 70 years. These very long terms entail that many millions of old works –
sometimes created more than a century ago – are still in copyright, and
therefore need to be licensed by cultural heritage institutions. The Orphan
Works Directive requires ‘diligent searches’ for the copyright owners of
old works before these works can be digitized. But for libraries and other
cultural heritage institutions that collect and have digitized vast numbers
of works, this is no viable solution.


Legal scholars and economists agree that these long terms of protection are
disproportionate and unwarranted, and can be easily reduced without
undermining copyright’s economic, social and cultural functions. No author,
artist or record company invests creativity or resources with a view to
recoupment in 50 or 100 years. There are also no compelling social reasons
for having the great-grandchildren of authors or artists benefit from the
copyrights of their ancestors.


Therefore, the Term Directive should be revised to reduce the terms of
copyright and neighbouring rights to more reasonable time-spans.
Calculating the optimal term for copyright or related rights is however
difficult. But other rights of intellectual property are indicative. For
example, the maximum term of protection for patented inventions is 20
years. Industrial designs enjoy protection for a maximum of five times five
years (25 years). Database producers enjoy fifteen years of database right
under the 1996 Database Directive.


Term reduction to life plus 50 years for copyright works, and 50 years for
neighbouring rights would be compatible with international treaties. The
Berne Convention and the TRIPs Agreement (WTO) require a minimum term of
copyright protection of life plus 50 year. The TRIPs Agreement and the 1996
WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty both require minimum terms of 50
years for performers and phonogram producers. TRIPs requires a mere 20
years for broadcasting organisations.




  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

X YES


See answers to Q. 24 and 25  (below).


  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

X YES


See answers to Q. 24 and 25  (below).


  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


See answers to Q. 24 and 25 (below).


  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

X YES


In  a  world  of  exponential  technological  change  the  need   for   more
flexibility  in  EU  copyright  law,  particularly  as   regards   copyright
limitations and exceptions (L&E’s), is self-evident.  At the  same  time  EU
law should be sufficiently predictable  and  harmonizing,  so  as  to  offer
right holders and users across the EU enough  legal  security  and  a  level
playing field.


Copyright laws in  the  Member  States  traditionally  provide  for  ‘closed
lists’ of limitations and  exceptions  that  precisely  enumerate  permitted
uses. Often these rules are connected to specific states of technology,  and
therefore easily outdated. EU law  currently  leaves  Member  States  little
room to update L&E’s in the light  of  new  technological  development.  The
Information Society Directive lists twenty-one L&E’s that Member States  may
provide for (only one of  which  is  mandatory),  but  does  not  allow  any
further exceptions beyond this list. For example, the list does not  mention
user-generated content,  data  mining  or  the  information  location  tools
(search engines). On the other hand, the optional nature  of  the  list  has
left L&E’s largely unharmonized  –  with some MS’s  implementing almost  the
entire list and others only a small number of exceptions. The  Directive  is
therefore both too ‘open’ and too ‘closed’ .


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

We propose amendment of the Information Society Directive, by making a  core
set of limitations and exceptions mandatory for  all  Member  States,  while
allowing the Member States flexibility in applying other L&E’s depending  on
social-cultural circumstances, or in response  to  unforeseen  technological
change.


Mandatory L&E’s would be those that reflect fundamental  information  rights
and  freedoms  (e.g.  for  quotation,  new  reporting,  parody,  information
location, research and data mining, user-generated content), and those  that
have an immediate impact on the workings of the Single Market (e.g.  private
copying and archiving). Some essential L&E’s, such as the  quotation  right,
could additionally be made ‘standard user license-proof’ by  declaring  them
non-overridable by contract.


To avoid  a  flexible  rule  on  L&E’s  from  becoming  too  open-ended  the
Directive should ensure, as it already does, that all L&E’s be subjected  to
the ‘three-step test’ : excepted uses shall apply only  in  certain  special
cases; not conflict with the normal exploitation  of  copyright  works;  and
not unreasonably prejudice the interests of authors and right holders.


A more harmonizing and more flexible approach to L&E’s would  be  compatible
with international  treaties.  Both  the  Berne  Convention  and  the  TRIPs
Agreement  (WTO)  leave  contracting  states  discretion  to   shape   L&E’s
according to their own needs, subject to the application of the  ‘three-step
test’.  An increasing number of WTO members,  such  as  the  United  States,
Singapore and Israel, permit ‘fair use’ – a  more  open  and  flexible  norm
than is proposed here.


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

X YES


See answer to Q. 24 (above).


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

X NO


While a robust copyright regime  naturally  requires  effective  enforcement
remedies, current EU rules on copyright enforcement are sometimes  perceived
as disproportionate or abusive. Injunctions  against  online  intermediaries
occasionally  encroach  on  fundamental  rights  and   freedoms,   and   are
insufficiently harmonized.


With the  widespread  availability  of  broad-band  Internet  in  households
everywhere in Europe, copyright infringement by way of  (peer-to-peer)  file
sharing has  taken  on  epidemic  proportions.  Despite  increased,  and  on
occasion  draconian,  civil  and  criminal  enforcement,   this   mass-scale
infringement has not disappeared, nor is  it  expected  to  subside  in  the
foreseeable  future.  With  content  owners  realizing  that   ‘suing   your
customers’ is not good for business, and providers of file sharing  services
elusive,  the  focus  of  copyright  enforcement  has  shifted   to   online
intermediaries, such as Internet access  providers  and  content  platforms.
Whereas the 2000 E-Commerce Directive has created ‘safe harbours’ for  these
intermediaries, these immunities do not rule  out  injunctive  relief.  What
form of injunctive  relief  is  granted  however  is  largely  left  to  the
national courts. This has led to legal uncertainty  and  disharmony  between
the MS’s.  Courts  in  some  MS’s  allow  far-reaching  injunctions  forcing
intermediaries, for instance, to disclose personal subscriber data or  block
access to designated IP addresses or  domains.  Courts  in  other  MS’s,  by
contrast, are more reluctant to  grant  injunctive  relief  against  neutral
intermediaries. The EU Court of Justice  has  declared  the  most  egregious
injunctions, such as a court order obliging wholesale filtering of  incoming
Internet traffic, incompatible with  fundamental  freedoms  protected  under
the EU Charter, but has left it to the MS’s  to  permit  or  prohibit  court
orders to  disclose  personal  data  of  allegedly  infringing  subscribers.
Clearly, there  is  a  need  for  harmonization  of  copyright  remedies  in
accordance with the rules of the Charter.


More generally, EU  copyright  enforcement  rules  are  often  perceived  as
disproportionate. The current EU rule that  attorney’s  fees  may  be  fully
recovered by copyright owners prevailing  in  court  proceedings,  has  made
many defendants risk-averse and has opened the door for businesses based  on
copyright infringement blackmail (‘copyright trolls’).


We  therefore  propose  revising  the  E-Commerce  Directive  and   the   IP
Enforcement Directive by (1) harmonizing  the  rules  on  injunctive  relief
against intermediaries in accordance with the EU Charter, (2)  relaxing  the
rule of recovery of  attorney’s  fees,  and  (3)  making  abusive  copyright
enforcement strategies (troll behaviour) unlawful.


These amendments  are  compatible  with  international  treaty  obligations,
notably the TRIPs Agreement’s chapter on IP enforcement.



  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

X YES


See answer to Q. 79 (below).

  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

Despite more than two decades of  harmonization  in  the  EU,  copyright  in
Europe remains in essence national law. Each Member State still has its  own
law on copyright and neighbouring (related)  rights  that  applies  strictly
within its own territory. This territorial fragmentation critically  impedes
the establishment of a fully functioning Single Market for creative  content
– for two reasons. First, despite  extensive  harmonization  copyright  laws
still vary from one Member State to another. For example, the French law  on
literary property looks, feels and essentially is still very different  from
the copyright law in the United Kingdom or the law  on  author’s  rights  in
Germany. This perpetuates legal uncertainty  in  cross-border  transactions,
harmonization  notwithstanding.  Second,  making  a  work  available  online
affects as many copyright laws as there are countries where the posted  work
can be accessed. With copyrights regularly  ‘split  up’  between  nationally
operating right  holders  and  CMO’s,  territoriality  severely  complicates
online licensing and entails massive transactions  costs.  Most  likely  the
territorial nature of copyright within the EU has  seriously  inhibited  the
growth of the creative economy in the EU, as compared to the  United  States
where copyright holders and users have to deal with only a single  (federal)
copyright law.

While promoting multi-territorial licensing  may  somewhat  alleviate  these
problems, a more ambitious solution -  and a  logical  next  step  now  that
harmonization is almost complete –  would be true unification  of  copyright
by way of a European Copyright Law  (Regulation)  replacing  national  laws.
Article 118 of the  TFEU,  introduced  by  the  Lisbon  Reform  Treaty,  has
created a specific competence for  the  European  legislature  to  establish
intellectual property rights with direct Union-wide effect.

The advantages of unification  are  undeniable.  A  European  Copyright  Law
would establish a truly unified legal framework, replacing  a  multitude  of
concurring, and sometimes conflicting, national copyright rules. A  European
Copyright Law would have immediate Union-wide effect, thereby  automatically
creating a Single Market for copyrights and related rights, both online  and
offline.  A  European  Copyright  Law  would  enhance  legal  security   and
transparency,  for  right  owners  and  users  alike,  and  greatly   reduce
transaction costs in cross-border trade.  Unification  by  regulation  could
also help to restore the asymmetry that is inherent in the  current  acquis,
which mandates basic economic rights, but  merely  permits  limitations  and
exceptions.

A copyright unification initiative would admittedly  be  a  project  of  the
long term, possibly requiring ten years or more. But this is  no  reason  to
postpone it. If the creative sector in the EU  is compete on  equal  footing
with competitors in the United States and  elsewhere,  a  unified  copyright
framework is inevitably required.



  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

The Information Society  Directive  obliges  the  MS’s  to  protect  digital
rights  management  systems  (DRMs)  against  acts  of   circumvention   and
facilitating circumvention. These  rules  are  generally  perceived  as  too
complex, overprotective and are also widely ignored in practice.
When introduced in 2001 these rules were already controversial  given  their
potential of impeding technological and scientific progress.  The  EU  rules
go much further than similar rules  in  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  by
providing an absolute ban  on  acts  of  circumvention,  even  if  done  for
legitimate purposes  such  as  sampling  a  DRM-protected  work  for  public
library purchase, or in the context of encryption  research.  The  EU  rules
are notoriously complex and opaque, and have been implemented  by  the  MS’s
in diverse ways.  On  the  ground  the  rules  are  generally  ignored.  For
example, software devices that allow users to remove the content  scrambling
system (CSS) on DVD’s is widely available  on  the  Internet  and  routinely
applied – with right  owners  rarely  invoking  anti-circumvention  laws  in
court.

We therefore propose to simplify the rules  on  protection  of  DRM  of  the
Information Society Directive. Anti-circumvention  protection  should  apply
at most in cases where circumvention  is  directly  connected  to  copyright
infringement. Circumvention should always be allowed where this is done  for
legitimate purposes.

Simplification  of  DRM  protection  can  be   done   in   compliance   with
international treaty obligations. The WIPO Copyright  Treaty  and  the  WIPO
Performance and Phonograms Treaty (both of  1996)  merely  require  adequate
legal protection against circumvention – not against  circumvention-enabling
devices, and allow broad exceptions in line with copyright L&E’s.
