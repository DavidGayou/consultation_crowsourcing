I.    Introduction
A.      Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which
rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and
data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in
making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not
reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed
or on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into
account in the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in
the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works" 7 and "Content Online" 8 . These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the
online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the
value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions
elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright
in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green
Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions
on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF:


Name: Europeana Foundation
We are answering on behalf of the Europeana Foundation and the Europeana Network.
The Europeana Network is an open forum for experts across Europe, from content
providers and aggregators to providers of technical, legal and strategic knowledge
and the creative industries.
This consultation offers a unique opportunity to provide input into a discussion that
will shape the future rules by which cultural heritage institutions in Europe will have
to play. It is clear that the current rules limit what we can achieve by leveraging digital
technologies. We hope that our response to the consultation will contribute to a
meaningful conversation on how to craft copyright rules that ensure that Europeana
and the Network can fulfill their objectives in the digital environment.
This response has been drawn up in consultation with the organisations represented
on Europeana Foundation Board and has been further approved through a
consultation with the Europeana Network. Three organisations have requested us to
add the following statements to our response:
•   The Federation of European publishers (FEP) which is a member of the Europeana
    Foundation board and a member of the network has participated in the drafting
    process. The FEP does not support the answers provided in this document (with
    the exception of the answer to question 19). The position of the FEP with regards
    to the other questions can be found in the submission of the FEP.
•   The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL), which is a member of the
    Europeana Foundation Board, has been asked to participate in the drafting
    process of this response. The CENL has provided its own position to the
    consultation which, due to the nature of CENL’s membership, differs to the
    Europeana submission on several points.
•   International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations (IFRRO) is a
    member of the Europeana network. IFRRO does not support the answers provided
    in this document (with the exception of the answer to question 19). The position of

II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.       Why is it not possible to access many online content
         services from anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of
the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management 10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe” 12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability,
i.e. the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and
access to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not
all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service
is available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they
can only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in
another Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

B.       Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of
         what needs to be authorised (or not) in digital
         transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment
is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that
are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software17 and
databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission
– e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.



1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court
of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting”
of a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act

subject matter”.

(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the
online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in
a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
   content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


   YES


   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
   required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin"
   approach23)

   No, it is not. With limited resources available within Cultural Heritage Organisations
   to spend on rights clearance, the only acceptable way to provide more clarity with
   regards to the scope of the 'making available' right would be to apply a country of
   origin principle.
   Europeana's mission is to provide access to cultural heritage throughout the EU. In
   the majority of cases, works are made available to Europeana without territorial
   restrictions. There is substantial uncertainty among Europeana's data providers
   about the scope of the 'making available' right when making works in their
   collection available to audiences in all of Europe. This is especially pronounced in
   the case of audiovisual collections.
   An approach based on targeted audiences would create increased burdens since
   dissemination through Europeana is explicitly targeted at users in all member
   states. Applying a targeted approach would therefore undermine the very objective
   of Europeana as making cultural heritage collections available to audiences in
   other member states would be penalised by additional rights clearance
   requirements.

   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and

licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to
another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several
cases are pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the
provision of a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making
available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
    protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
    subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
     YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
     specific circumstances, and why

     NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under
     specific     circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of
     communication to the public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a
     copyright exception)
     No, it should not. Linking to online resources does not constitute an act of making
     available. Requiring authorisation to link to works that are available online would
     undermine the fundamental principles of the internet. This is especially true for
     Europeana whose primary service is to provide links to works contained on the
     websites of other cultural heritage organisations. Requiring authorisation from
     rights holders would introduce significant legal uncertainty.

     No, it should not. Requiring the authorisation of the rights holder for viewing and
     reading content that is already available online does not make sense. It creates

     internet which is to make information and culture accessible.

4.       Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the
further distribution of that tangible article) 27 . The issue that arises here is whether this
principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to
distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult
questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-
sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred
to as the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in
contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).

C.      Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a
        good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification
    and licensing of works and other subject matter?


     YES


     NO
     NO OPINION




16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
     [Open question]
     A registration system would increase the amount of information about rights
     holders available to all types of users including cultural heritage institutions. This
     will make it easier for users to check the copyright status of a work and obtain
     permission for use from the rights holders.
     One of the biggest problems facing cultural heritage institutions attempting to
     make their collections available online is the lack of comprehensive, easily (ideally

29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

     automatic) accessible information about the copyright status of works, and the
     identity and location of rights holders. Introducing a registration system at a
     European level would be a first step in ensuring that such information is more
     readily available in the future. Europeana is working with its data providers to
     open up public domain works from their collections and, by providing more legal
     certainty, a registration system would increase the re-use potential of such works.
     An effective and useful registration system needs to record transfers of rights
     throughout the duration of the copyright protection of the registered works and be
     transparent and easy to use. All types of rights holders (including individual
     creators) should be able to register their works, and it should include information
     on works that are out of copyright or available under open licences in order to
     create more legal certainty for users of such works.
     To fully realise the above advantages, a registration system would need to be
     mandatory. However a mandatory registration a system cannot be implemented
     without changes to international agreements.




17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
     [Open question]
     A registration system;
•    would require extra effort from rights holders registering their works.
•    would require regulation, administration and monitoring which would require
     additional funding most likely from rights holders registering their works, which
     will create extra costs.
•    would need to be mandatory, which requires changes to international agreements
     that the EU has signed up to.
•    will not be able to retroactively solve the existing problem with orphan works and
     mass digitisation (see more about this in reaction to questions 40 and 41).

D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of
        identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are

specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 32 should, once operational,
provide a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works
worldwide. The Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the
expression and management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It
includes the development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data
model for all types of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take
such identification systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling
automated licensing across different sectors.

19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
    content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
    ownership and permissions databases?


     [Open question]


     The European Union must ensure: (1) that identifiers as well as rights ownership
     and permission databases are based on open standards, available to all content
     creators and that they can be read by all market participants free of charge; (2)
     that all identifiers as well as rights ownership and permission databases are
     interoperable and work across all of Europe (and beyond).
     Any system that is developed must be developed in a true multi-stakeholder
     approach (e.g. not only by rights holders and intermediaries) and should be
     reflective of work already undertaken. Rights ownership and permission
     databases in particular must be publicly accessible via machine readable
     interfaces. They must also include the ability to store information on out-of-
     copyright works, works in the public domain and openly licensed works.
     Europeana has developed an open and flexible system that focuses on providing
     interoperable ownership and permission information for works that are made
     available by more than 2,000 providing institutions throughout, and beyond, the
     EU.




E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne

   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international
agreements, providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication.
Performers and producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an
extended term of protection.

20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
    environment?


        YES – Please explain
        ……………………………………………………………………………………………….
        ……………………………………………………………………………………………….


        NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
        No, from the perspective of Europeana and the cultural heritage institutions
        contributing to Europeana, the current terms of copyright protection (including
        neighbouring rights protection) are too long. Cultural heritage institutions hold
        large collections of works that are still under copyright (or where the copyright
        status is unclear) but that are not exploited commercially anymore.
        There are barriers to the incentive to digitise and make available online the large
        collections of works that are no longer commercially exploited but are or may still
        be protected by copyright. The rights holders lack the economic incentive to
        recover the costs of digitising an out-of-commerce work. In contrast, the cultural
        heritage institution, incentivised by their own public mission, are confronted with
        the additional cost of rights clearance without the promise of economic return.
        The term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark contrast with the
        comparatively short commercial life of the large majority of in-copyright works. As
        a result, the length of copyright protection prevents cultural heritage institutions
        digitising and making available in-copyright works and thus from effectively
        fulfilling their public mission.
        One of the outcomes of this is the existence of the so-called ‘20th century black
        hole’ when it comes to online availability of copyrighted works[1]. There are
        significantly fewer works from the mid to late 20th century available on Europeana
        than works from the centuries before (many of which are clearly in the public
        domain) or from the 21st century (many of which are still available commercially):

source: Europeana Collections and Data Analysis, Strategy and Plan, July 2012


The same effect has been observed in other studies dealing with commercial
availability on amazon.com[2].
Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of works that are in
copyright but out of commercial exploitation and will thus reduce the scope of the
problems outlined above. Given this, the term of copyright protection should be
reduced to the minimum requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of
the creator plus 50 years)[3].
In addition there are also problems with the recent extension of the protection of
sound recordings that affect cultural heritage organisations. The directive
extending the term of protection of the rights of performers and phonogram
producers on music recordings within the EU was clearly drafted with the
recording industry and musicians in mind. However, the wording of the directive
makes it clear that it applies to all types of sound recordings, including
broadcasts and wildlife sounds. The directive does not give any guidance on how
the 'use it or lose it' rule and other provisions should be applied to non-
commercial archival recordings.
In addition, Baltic sound and audiovisual archives have also been concerned with
the problem of applying the copyright term directive to sound recordings made
before 1991, before these countries regained their independence. It has been
difficult to determine the current owners of such recordings, and the extension
means that we have to live with this problem far into the future.

III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

States at the time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).

   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database
Directive, (iii) Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21. Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
    provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


    YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


    Yes. For a pan-European core service such as Europeana, this creates an uneven
    playing field. Cultural Heritage Organisations should be able to enjoy the same
    exceptions in all member states.
    The transition to digital services enables cultural heritage institutions to
    collaborate across borders and make their collections available across all of
    Europe and this needs to be mirrored by harmonising the exceptions benefitting
    these institutions. Without such harmonisation, cultural heritage institutions in
    some member states are disadvantaged vis-a-vis their partners in others[4].
    Cultural heritage institutions are increasingly working together on digitisation
    projects - as specifically recommended in the 'New Renaissance' report on
    bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online[5]. The fact that the exceptions
    benefitting publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives have not been
    implemented (uniformly) in all member states creates unnecessary uncertainties
    and disadvantages institutions in some member states vis-a-vis institutions in
    others. This lack of harmonisation introduces unnecessary friction costs for
    institutions engaging in cross-border collaborations like Europeana.

22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need
    for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


   YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


   Yes. All existing and additional exceptions should be made mandatory and
   harmonised to the fullest extent possible (including being broadened in line with
   our response to the relevant questions below).
   All the exceptions provided by the EU copyright directives are drafted on the
   basis that they do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and,
   therefore, do not unreasonably prejudice rights holders. Making them mandatory
   in all member states should have no negative effect on rights holders, and in
   many cases this will substantially benefit citizens and other public policy
   objectives such as access to knowledge and culture or inclusive education.
   For Europeana, who have the objective of making knowledge and culture available
   to users across all of Europe, it is not acceptable that citizens in some member
   states enjoy a lesser level of access to the collections of Cultural Heritage
   Organisations. This uneven implementation of exceptions and limitations of the
   copyright directive becomes more pressing as more and more activities of
   cultural heritage institutions are taking place online.

23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
    existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


   [Open question]


   Yes. There is a need for additional exceptions and limitations. Cultural heritage
   institutions need to be enabled to make out-of-commerce works in their
   collections available online for non-commercial purposes. As outlined in the
   answer to question 34, this does not require a new exception or limitation but can
   be achieved by expanding the scope of the existing provision in article 5(3)n of
   the directive.
   We also see a need for new exceptions that enable certain forms of usage by the
   general public that allow citizens and researchers to fully leverage the online
   access to protected works provided by Europeana and its partners. New
   exceptions should be added that allow non-commercial sharing of protected
   works by individuals, as well as for text and data mining (see our answer to Q55).

   There is a need to introduce an open-ended norm to all new exceptions and
   limitations (see answer to Q24).
24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
    degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and
    exceptions?


   YES – Please explain why


   Yes. There is a need for more flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for
   limitations and exceptions[6]. The exceptions and limitations in the 2001
   Copyright Directive were not drafted in a technologically neutral manner which is
   problematic in times of accelerated technological progress.
   By definition, exception and limitations that apply to specific uses cannot ensure
   that as of yet unknown forms of use are covered by them. Technological
   innovation can be expected to lead to new forms of use in the near future and
   Europe’s copyright framework must be flexible enough to deal with such
   developments.
   The current discussion about text and data mining is a good example of this.
   European researchers have to deal with legal uncertainties about the status of text
   and data mining activities because the copyright directive fails to address this
   form of use that was (relatively) unknown when it was adopted. An open norm
   would provide more certainty on the legal aspects of activities like text and data
   mining without having to undertake legislative changes (which take years to
   implement).
   A greater degree of flexibility is also desirable when we compare other countries
   that have a more flexible approach to exceptions and limitations. US cultural
   heritage institutions contributing to the Digital Public Library of America (the US
   equivalent of Europeana) have far greater flexibility when making decisions on
   which collections to digitise and to make available. While European institutions
   primarily focus on material that is out of copyright, US institutions can leverage
   the built-in flexibility of the fair use doctrine when making decisions on which
   parts of their collections to offer online. From the perspective of Europeana and
   its contributing partners, this constitutes a clear competitive disadvantage. This is
   also true for the end-users: citizens, researchers and educations in the US
   currently have far better access to their recent (20th century) culture than
   European citizens (even though Europe has had a head start when it comes to
   publicly funded digitisation projects).

25. If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
    interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
    interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use
    or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would
    be the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its
    possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.


    [Open question]


    The best approach would be one that provides built-in flexibility in reaction to new
    technological developments or new forms of use. An open norm such as fair use
    fits this description.
    It should be implemented EU-wide (see also answer to Question 22) and in
    addition to (existing) targeted exceptions and limitations. As long as an open
    norm is implemented EU-wide, its effect on the functioning of the single market
    would be minimal while it can be expected to improve the competitive position of
    European market actors vis-a-vis market participants in other jurisdictions that
    have an open norm.

    a problem?

A.      Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow
acts of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other
subject matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception
or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

     1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the
number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal
status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available
web content) is often uncertain.


28. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works
    or other subject matter in your collection?
     (b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with
     the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the
     preservation exception?


     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.


     Whilst the consultation document limits itself to activities of libraries and
     archives, the questions in this section are equally relevant for museums and other
     cultural heritage institutions. In fact, the relevant exceptions and limitations
     explicitly apply to ‘publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments or
     museums, or […] archives’. The 2012 Orphan Works directive clarifies this to
     include 'film or audio heritage institutions and public-service broadcasting
     organisations'. In line with this, the following answers (28-35 and 39-41) should be

41
   Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
42
   Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

read as applying to all cultural heritage institutions falling within this scope and
not only to libraries and archives.
Europeana does not have a collection of its own and does not fall within the scope
of the reproduction exception. However, it is essential for the functioning of
Europeana that the contributing organisations can digitise all works in their
collections regardless of their copyright status. Institutions increasingly digitise
works in their collections not only to prevent harm to the work, but to be able to
better fulfill their missions. Digital copies of cultural heritage works provide many
advantages such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to access and
having lower storage costs. The current national implementations of the exception
contained in article 5(2)n do not allow cultural heritage institutions to structurally
create digital copies of works in their collection. This is highly detrimental in an
environment where, as the 'New Renaissance' report[7] puts it, 'digitisation is
more than a technical option, it is a moral obligation'.
In addition, recital 40 of the directive which states that 'Such an exception or
limitation should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of
protected works or other subject-matter' is highly problematic. As online
dissemination of works becomes more and more important for cultural heritage
institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way is simply
anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using digitised works in a
meaningful way. From the perspective of Europeana, which was set up by the
European Commission as a platform for online delivery of cultural heritage
objects, such a limitation is highly problematic.
Also, technological measures and their relationship with the           exceptions
benefitting cultural heritage institutions are highly problematic: often CDs and
DVDs are protected by technological measures, the removal of which would
require the cooperation of the producer. Art. 6 of the Infosoc Directive provides
that technological protection measures are protected per se, independently on the
scope of protection, entrusting to voluntary agreements or to subsidiary
interventions of member states the adoption of appropriate measures to ensure
that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content.

29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

    [Open question]


   The best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article 5(2)c of the
   copyright directive, so that it allows cultural heritage institutions to make
   reproductions of all works in their collection as long as these are not intended for
   direct commercial advantage. In line with our answer to question 22, this
   exception should be made mandatory for all member states.
   Also Art. 6 of the InfoSoc directive should be revised in order to enforce
   exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate utilisations of protected
   works, regardless of format or mode of dissemination.




30. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
    elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
    under which conditions?


   [Open question]


   The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(2)c
   of the copyright directive. Instead of only allowing specific acts of reproduction, it
   should allow all acts of reproduction necessary for publicly accessible libraries,
   educational establishments or museums, or by archives to achieve aims related to
   their public-interest missions. This should include reproductions made as part of
   mass digitisation efforts, back-up copies and reproductions for format shifting.
   Reproductions should be limited to internal use which is not for direct commercial
   or economic advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations
   allowed for by the directive (such as the broadened version of the exception
   foreseen in article 5(3)n that we propose in answer to question 34). Reproductions
   would explicitly be allowed for the purposes of increasing the operational
   efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions. The exception should
   only apply to works that are part of the permanent collection of an institution and
   not to works that have been loaned from other institutions (such as interlibrary
   loans or loans from museum exhibitions).
   Broadening the scope of the extension along these lines mirrors the
   recommendations made as part of the European Commission commissioned
   'Study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in
   the information society' from December 2013[8].
   Also Art. 6 of the InfoSoc directive should be revised in order to enforce
   exceptions and limitations and to ensure legitimate use of protected works,
   regardless of format or mode of dissemination.

    2. Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than
agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online
access to collections.


32. (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
    to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts
    thereof) for purposes of research and private study?
    (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
    problems when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other
    subject-matter held in the collections of institutions such as universities and
    national libraries when you are not on the premises of the institutions in
    question?
    (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
    institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access,
    including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their
    collections, for purposes of research and private study?


    [Open question]

    As an aggregator, Europeana does not have a collection of its own and and as a
    result does not engage in direct negotiations with rights holders to provide
    remote access. From the perspective of Europeana, this question fails to address
    the most urgent issue confronting cultural heritage institutions today: providing
    online access to works in their collection.
    Among the existing exceptions allowed by the InfoSoc directive, the exception for
    the consultation of works and other subject-matter via dedicated terminals on the

   premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study
   comes closest to a mechanism that could enable such uses.
   From our perspective as well as the perspective of publicly available libraries,
   archives and museums and the perspective of their patrons (end-
   users/consumers), the existing exception that allows institutions to make works in
   their collections available ‘for the purpose of research or private study, to
   individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises’ (article
   5(3)n) is extremely limited and not in line with the technological possibilities and
   the legitimate expectations of users anymore. Especially in the light of extremely
   fast development of mobile devices and services the dedicated terminal approach
   is no longer realistic.
   Limiting the availability of digitised works to dedicated terminals on the premises
   of cultural heritage institutions prevents them from reaching citizens that cannot
   travel to the premises (for example because they are disabled or because they
   lack the economic means to do so). Furthermore, it is out of line with the
   legitimate expectation of users that have been shaped by universal online
   accessibility of other services. Europe's citizens and researchers would greatly
   benefit from online access to the collections of Europe's publicly funded
   institutions. In fact, enabling such access is the very purpose of Europeana.
   For publicly funded cultural heritage institutions to fully participate in the digital
   public space they must be enabled to offer online services that are available from
   everywhere and by anyone seeking ‘to participate in the cultural life of the
   community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its
   benefits’, as enshrined by article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights. Online universal access to the collections of publicly accessible libraries,
   museums and archives can play an important role in realising this objective. This
   objective has been recognised by the European legislator a number of times and it
   is time that the European copyright rules are adapted to facilitate this objective.




33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

   [Open question]


   The best solution would be to broaden the existing exception in article 5(3)n of the
   copyright directive and make it mandatory, so that it allows institutions to make
   available digital copies of out-of-commerce works in their collections via
   electronic networks such as the internet for non-commercial and educational
   purposes.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
    elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and
    under which conditions?

    [Open question]


    The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in article 5(3)n
    of the copyright directive. Instead of limiting the 'making available' to dedicated
    terminals on the premises of the institutions, it should also apply to making the
    works available online via public networks such as the internet. The scope of the
    exception should further be expanded to not only include ‘the purpose of research
    or private study’ by ‘individual members of the public’ but should apply to all non-
    commercial uses (including education).
    Furthermore, It seems reasonable to limit the scope of the exception to ‘works and
    other subject-matter not subject to purchase or licensing terms’ as long as they
    are still commercially available. This should be combined with an opt-out clause
    that would allow rights holders to either prevent the making available of their
    works or to negotiate licensing terms with the institutions (either on an individual
    basis or collectively).
    These conditions are crucial to ensure that the new broadened exception meets
    the requirements of the three-step test. Limiting the scope of the exception to
    publicly accessible cultural heritage institutions and to out-of-commerce works
    and works that are not subject to licensing terms should satisfy the 'certain
    special cases' criterion and cannot, by definition, be in conflict with the 'normal
    exploitation' of the works in question. The fact that the exception would be limited
    to non-commercial uses of the works made available and that authors can decide
    to opt-out of the exception would further ensure that 'the legitimate interests of
    the author' are not necessarily prejudiced.
    In fact, many authors would benefit from improving online access to out-of-
    commerce works because works that they have created are kept available via
    cultural heritage institutions (and are available to them to build upon or to do
    research). As a result, citizens also greatly benefit, because they are granted
    access to works that wouldn't be available through market players.
    This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendations made in the
    'New Renaissance' report. The report recommended that 'National governments
    and the European Commission should promote solutions for the digitisation of
    and cross-border access to out of distribution works' and that 'For cultural
    institutions collective licensing solutions and a window of opportunity should be
    backed by legislation, to digitise and bring out of distribution works online, if
    rights holders and commercial providers do not do so’[9].

    3. E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.


36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems when
    trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending),
    including across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
     (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific
     problems when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-
     lending), including across borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
     (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
     libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including
     across borders?

     YES – Please explain with specific examples


     While Europeana does not currently engage in e-lending of books or other types
     of works, we think that this is an important question which will become relevant
     for Europeana in the future: as more and more cultural goods are published in
     electronic form (either digital only or in addition to traditional forms of
     publication), cultural heritage institutions, and especially libraries, are faced with
     specific problems related to integrating such works into their collections and
     services. As the share and relevance of born-digital works increases, digital
     aggregators such as Europeana will want to provide access to such works.
     At the moment, libraries are facing a number of problems when attempting to
     negotiate agreements to facilitate electronic lending. These include:
•   Denial of sales of electronic books to libraries by publishers;
•   Removal of content that was available for e-lending without informing the library;
•   The use of multiple licences and different models creating lack of clarity on the
     condition of access to the content for users;
•   A deterioration of registered users’ rights (crossing a border with a borrowed book
    was not a problem. Trans-border online access to an electronic copy offered by a
    library is often impossible as the result of restrictive licensing conditions).

    More generally, the question is if it is necessary and desirable to negotiate
    agreements to enable electronic lending. Contrary to what is stated in the
    introduction to this question, there is considerable uncertainty about the status of
    e-lending under EU law. The directive on rental and lending does not explicitly
    exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its scope and some libraries
    argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft decision by the ECJ,
    they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download. In the
    Netherlands, the Association of Public Libraries (Vereniging van Openbare
    Bibliotheken) has brought the matter before the courts. They started a test case
    against the collective management organisation in charge of the lending right
    arguing that they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download.
    It should also be noted that the copyright implications of digital reproductions of
    loaned museum objects are unclear, especially if the lending takes place across
    borders. From the perspective of the museum, this subject requires additional
    clarification.


    NO


    NO OPINION




37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

    [Open question]


    The best solution for the problem would be to create legal certainty by
    unambiguously including the right to e-lending in the EU acquis. While the lending
    of analogue works is currently being enabled by directive 2006/115 e-lending,
    which is most often considered as an act of making available, it would probably
    need to be regulated via an (additional) exception in the InfoSoc directive.
    In line with our answers to the issues of online availability and reproductions
    given above, we consider it necessary that e-lending is covered by a mandatory
    exception that is harmonised across the EU. Since e-lending must be available for
    all books (commercially available or not), it should be treated separately from the
    general exception for making works available online that we argue for in response
    to question 34. Instead, a new exception should be created specifically for e-
    lending. This exception could take the form of a statutory licence with fair
    compensation for authors.
    Given the fact that e-books are generally not sold but licensed, there are a number
    of additional issues that would need to be addressed:
•   All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be available to libraries for
    acquisition and access;
•   All e-book titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;
•   Publishers should be required to deliver e-books in interoperable formats;

•   Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books to
    users only for limited periods of time.
•   It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously;
•   Registered users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by
    way of remote access via authentication systems.
    Given that many e-book vendors currently employ technical measures that restrict
    certain forms of use, the proposed introduction of an exception for e-lending
    reinforces the need to revise Art. 6 of the InfoSoc in order to enforce exceptions
    and limitations and to ensure legitimate uses of protected works, regardless of
    format or mode of dissemination.




The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
    management of physical and online collections, including providing access to
    your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

    [Open question]


    From the perspective of an online aggregator of cultural heritage collections,
    there are enormous differences between physical and online collections. These
    differences are so fundamental that it does not makes sense to compare the two.
    The ability to offer access to their collections online frees cultural heritage
    institutions from many of the constraints imposed on them by the properties of
    analogue media and their physical infrastructure (such as buildings). Being able
    to offer access to collections online means that, in theory, access can be provided
    to full collections independent of the location of the viewer or the time of the day.
    This has the potential to radically improve the ability of publicly funded cultural
    heritage institutions to carry out their public mission to provide access to
    knowledge and culture.
    Unfortunately, this enormous potential is currently being held back by copyright
    rules which unnecessarily restrict how cultural heritage institutions can exercise
    their mission in the online environment. Under the current EU copyright rules,
    cultural heritage institutions are dependent on permission from rights holders in
    order to make protected works in their collection available online. As we have
    argued above, this makes no sense in situations where the majority of works held
    by these institutions are not even commercially available.
    With regards to the above, the 'study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC on
    copyright and related rights in the information society' that was commissioned by
    the European Commission and published in December 2013 contains an
    interesting observation. At the end of the section discussing inter alia the
    exceptions benefitting cultural heritage institutions, the authors observe that:


    "The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the
    collection, [...] the making available for consultation is increasingly requested to
    apply at distance and online; and the lending is shifting to cover the online

                                              34

    transmission of digital items. The exception-by-exception reasoning, which is the
    model of the InfoSoc Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is time to
    look at different uses that some categories of users (libraries or educational
    institutions) or some objectives (access to culture and knowledge or education)
    would be privileged to undertake under a limitation of copyright. [...] the space of
    non-infringing uses could be defined by their objective and some general
    conditions, including a more open requirement that the use does not exceed what
    is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this study has not made.
    It could make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and
    understandable for users and copyright owners alike. If the requirements for each
    exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not sacrifice the high level of
    protection of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted."


    From the perspective of Europeana, such an approach would have many benefits.
    It would create room for rethinking Europe's rich tradition of providing access to
    knowledge and culture through public institutions and it would enable Europeana
    and its partners to fully leverage the possibilities offered by digitisation and near
    universal connectivity.

   4. Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the
public. Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20th
century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly
addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key
principles on the digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works
which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate

mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements
between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies
representing authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books
that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised
and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by
Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the
largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of
representation of a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences
granted)45.

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
    digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
    necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the
    2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting
    societies) have a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works can be
    accessed across the EU?


     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved


     From the perspective of Europeana and the cultural heritage institutions
     contributing to Europeana, this question (and the following) is too limited. Given
     this, we believe that this question cannot be answered in a meaningful way by
     focusing on the application of the 2011 MoU alone.
     The issue of mass digitisation is far broader than what can be addressed with the
     2011 MoU and the 2012 Orphan Works directive (the other relevant European
     policy instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitisation of
     collections and the subsequent making available of digitised works require a
     comprehensive approach that cannot be based on the principles of a due
     diligence search and voluntary licensing agreements. If we want to enable
     European cultural heritage institutions to transfer their collections into the digital
     age (as expressed by the very existence of Europeana) we need a far more
     comprehensive approach.
     Both the 2012 directive on certain permitted uses of orphan works and the 2011
     MoU on out-of-commerce works are insufficient to address the copyright issues
     arising from mass digitisation projects. In addition, the extremely slow uptake of
     the MoU (according to the 2013 'study on the application of directive 2001/29/EC
     on copyright and related rights in the information society' there is one single
     project that is 'inspired' by the MoU) clearly illustrates that the MoU is not a
     suitable mechanism for enabling mass digitisation on a large scale.

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .

   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

    The Orphan Works directive is equally ill-suited to enable mass digitisation
    projects. While it will enable publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives
    to make orphan works available after a due diligence search has been carried out
    for specific works, the requirement of carrying out due diligence searches makes
    it effectively unusable for mass digitisation projects as this would require huge
    additional investments in both time and money.
    With regards to making the results of mass digitisation projects available online,
    the inadequacies of both the Orphan Works directive as well as the MoU can be
    addressed by an extension of the scope of the exception created by article 5(3)n
    of the copyright directive as outlined in the answer to question 34 above. Doing
    this would provide Europe's cultural heritage institutions a clear legal framework
    for operating in the digital environment that would allow them to to achieve aims
    related to their public interest missions.
    This approach would mean that mass digitisation and the resulting online
    activities of cultural heritage institutions are covered by two targeted exceptions:
    an exception covering the making of reproductions (an expanded version of the
    current exception defined in 5(2)c) of all works in their collections and an
    exception covering the making available of out-of-commerce works (an expanded
    version of the current exception defined in 5(3)n).

41. Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
    other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
    archives)?


    YES – Please explain


    This is certainly necessary. The public has a right to obtain online access to the
    collections of all publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives across
    Europe (see article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). There is no
    good reason for limiting mechanisms that create such access to certain types of
    content. One of the main goals of Europeana is to integrate collections of different
    types and to create links between cultural heritage objects held by a wide range of
    institutions.
    The approach proposed in reaction to questions 40 and 34 above would cover all
    types of works and other subject matter that are held by these institutions.

B.         Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC 46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

        One of the main intended uses of the content that is made available via Europeana
        is use in educational settings. Europeana is involved in a number of project that

   resources, and Europeana is working on a licence that allows for educational re-
   use.
   At present, article 5(3)a of the InfoSoc directive allows Member States to provide
   for exceptions or limitations to the rights of reproduction and communication to
   the public when a work is use[d] for the sole purpose of illustration by
   teaching…as long as the source, including the author’s name is indicated, unless
   this turns out to be impossible and to the extent justified by the non-commercial
   purpose to be achieved. The current exception for teaching in EU law is written in
   a rather broad and open way but none of the EU countries have implemented it as
   broadly as allowed by the Copyright Directive.
   Because of the narrow implementations of the broad exception provided in the
   directive, permitted use of works in education differ between member states. This
   presents special difficulties for the providers of online open courses and other
   open educational resources and service that can be access by citizens of various
   EU      countries,   for    example     by    the    recently  launched    portal
   http://openeducationeuropa.eu
   The challenges are especially problematic for the development of resources
   developed in the Lifelong Learning Programme and the new Erasmus+
   programme, where the audience is always cross-border and therefore multiple
   copyright laws apply. Educators and developers of open educational materials are
   less likely to publish and share their resources because they are not able to
   properly assess the legal consequences in other member states. This stands in
   the way of the implementation of the policies from Opening Up Education
   programme of the European Commission[13].

43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

   [Open question]


   The problem would best be solved by making a broad educational exception
   mandatory for all EU countries. This mandatory educational exception should
   cover all uses of all types of works for illustration of teaching, regardless of the
   institution. It is important to stress that uses of multimedia works (such as
   audiovisual material) should be expressly included.
   If implemented broadly into the national laws, the exception allows for use of any
   copyrighted material, including text, film, multimedia for illustration of teaching in
   classrooms and also in online courses. It should also allow for using copyrighted

    works in teaching compilations, whether analogue or digital. Such uses should
    not require a licence, especially if they are Open Educational Resources.
    It is important that educational use is clearly defined, so that the creators of
    (open) educational resources know what their rights are.

D.      Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC 48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).



50. (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
    persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to
    content, including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
    this exception?

E.         Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the
use of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories
or in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception
for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and
data mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear,
in particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or
not to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access”
to content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by

     For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
    experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining
    methods, including across borders?
     (b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles,
     linked to copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining
     methods, including across borders?
     (c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
     resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected
     content, including across borders?

     YES – Please explain


     Europeana does not currently provide text and data mining (TDM) services to the
     end user. However, it is technically possible to mine the metadata contained in
     Europeana via our API. That this is possible is due to a drive by Europeana to
     convince content providers to commit to making their metadata available under a
     CC0 public domain dedication. Europeana has now turned its attention to helping
     to realise the value of Europe’s digitised heritage by facilitating direct access to
     this content for researchers (Europeana Cloud) and the creative industries
     (Europeana Creative) in order to foster innovation. It is becoming increasingly
     clear that the ability to deploy TDM across this content will be an important factor
     in the success of such initiatives.
     At the same time much of our cultural heritage content is being enhanced in a
     manner which will be of value to researchers who are interested in applying TDM
     e.g. The Europeana Newspapers project enhances digitised historical
     newspapers, applying technologies such as optical character recognition and
     named entity recognition. The project has interviewed several researchers who
     have expressed how valuable it would be to mine such a corpus.

54. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

    [Open question]


    Although the vast majority of content aggregated by Europeana is public domain
    or, if not, open access, a huge amount of heterogeneity exists across the licences
    under which this content is made available. Even if the licence information is
    made available in the metadata (and often it is not) the mixture of licence
    conditions is not conducive to the application of TDM.




55. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
    elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?


    [Open question]


    A legislative solution granting an exception for the purpose of text and data
    mining would help to open up and realise the value of investment in digitised
    cultural heritage. Such an exception should allow for copies of content to be made
    in order to extract facts and data. It should not attempt to distinguish between
    commercial and non-commercial use.

57. Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use

    [Open question]
    Currently public domain cultural heritage content is distributed across countries
    and institutions. An infrastructure which allows end users to directly access and
    download the aggregated cultural content might help facilitate text and data
    mining

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works
with videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence
schemes concluded between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions
to ease user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems

     users publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other

     NO


53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

IV. Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for
such purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through
use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for
rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be
claimed by rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already
covers copies made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of
double payments whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence
fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.


64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
    the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
    a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the
    rightholder is minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59

     YES – Please explain


     NO – Please explain


     NO OPINION




66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services
    (e.g. services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have
    copies on different devices) impact the development and functioning of new
    business models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for
    products subject to levies?60


     YES – Please explain


     NO – Please explain

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same
time, many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante

reduce the number of undue payments61.

68. Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
    undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles
    to the free movement of goods or services?


     YES – Please specify the type of transaction and indicate the percentage of the undue
     payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement
     schemes could help to remedy the situation.


     NO – Please explain

V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately
remunerated, in particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that
the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole
value chain. Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to
terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not
suffice to improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary. .

72. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
    combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate
    remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

        [Open question] ………………………………………………… …………………………..
        ………………………………………………………………………………………………….



73. Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
    contracts)?

        NO – Please explain why

    address the shortcomings you identify?

VI. Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE 64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text 65 . Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought
by the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement
of copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the
infringed content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to
clarify the role of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be
clarification of the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75. Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
    infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?


     YES – Please explain


     NO – Please explain


     NO OPINION




76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
    involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising
    brokers, payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting
    online copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures
    would be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

VII.      A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright
debate for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that
the same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation
while allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.


78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as
    a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to
    copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


    YES


    NO


    NO OPINION




79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
    current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a
    longer term project?
