DIGITAL INTEROPERABILITY FORUM (DIF) RESPONSE TO COPYRIGHT
CONSULTATION
Transparency Register No. 77946677931-57

The Digital Interoperability Forum (DIF)1 represents major players involved in the pay TV
value chain on EU technology policy issues. DIF members2 represent all parts of the
broadcasting, communications and multimedia paid-for content value chain, including
transmission, hardware, software, middleware, platform operation and content provision.
DIF members have a strong interest in the continuing success of digital TV and information
society services in Europe and are actively involved in the provision of hybrid services and
products3.



7. Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including marketled
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?


NO DIF considers that the cross-border availability of content is a commercial issue; with the
existence of a viable market being a key criterion determining what and how much content
is available. Contrary to the views expressed by some stakeholders any alleged
shortcomings in cross-border availability of content is not a consequence of the lack of
technological interoperability, i.e., between devices, platforms, etc. Where content is
available on device A in one country but not in another is not attributable to insoluble
technological barriers but the result of commercial decisions take by rights holders. In the
circumstances there would appear to be no case for EU intervention – whether legislative or
non-legislative.

DIF welcomes the acknowledgement that sufficient protection must be afforded to rights
holders. However, it is not evident that there is insufficient protection available from the EU

aquis and which would deter rights holders from making content available on a cross-border
basis if sufficient demand existed.


19. What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?

DIF members have many years of experience in identifying and obtaining the rights required
for their services, resulting in the delivery of a vast, diverse and growing range of innovate
services to customers. They also have substantial experience in working in standards and
specifications groups such as DVB on the development of metadata specifications, content
referencing standards, etc. Many such standards exist. It can be tempting to argue that the
mere existence of multiple technologies demands that there must be a lack of
interoperability which must be addressed. DIF considers that this is a somewhat naïve view
that fails to recognise that stakeholders will choose the approach best suited to their needs.

For instance, in the pay TV sector ownerships and permissions are a matter for contracts –
between the rights holder and the broadcaster and the broadcaster (or pay TV operator)
and subscriber. Who owns and who is entitled to what is clear.

Accordingly DIF believes that the EU should not favour or promote any one system over
another. This is a situation in which no-one system of identifiers or database is appropriate
for all sectors. In this context DIF notes that even the Linked Content Coalition approach
which has been supported by the Commission and which emerged from the publishing
sector appears to acknowledge that the applicability of the rights reference model may not
be appropriate to all sectors.

52. What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?

DIF members already provide accessibility features including subtitles, audio description,
adapted devices (including remote controls, variable loudness, EPG fonts and colours, etc.)
and specialised call centre support for those with accessibility requirements.


64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?
YES There is an urgent need for clarity regarding the scope and application of the current
levy system. The system - which was developed to account for offline copying of
unprotected physical works – is out of place in the digital age. It is questionable what role, if
any, private copying levies should play in digital distribution models that incorporate the
cost of private use and copying in the price that consumers pay. DIF encourages the
Commission to look into the levies regime as a priority with a view to phasing out the
current system.

65. Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59

 NO DIF notes the various reports and other studies which have attempted to find a
resolution to the issue of the application of copy levies to digital devices. From these it
would appear that – with the exception of only a few Member States – the imposition of
private copying levies on devices is widespread and does not discriminate between the
actual amounts of copying – or alleged “harm” to the rights holder - which occurs.

Any attempt to introduce some discriminatory approach to the application of levies would
serve only to divert attention from solving the real problem, i.e., the imposition of a tax
(ultimately on consumers although many pay TV operators who provide free devices will
absorb the tax) which has its origins in a totally different era. DIF notes that copyright levies
result effectively in many millions of euro being paid by consumers to rights holders for
content they may not even copy in the devices subject to the levy or for which they have
already paid a fee that covers such private copying activities. Moreover, in an era where
there is a vastly greater amount of content available and many more distribution outlets for
content (compared to when the copyright levy was first applied) the original rationale for a
copyright levy – to reward and support the content industry – no longer exists. It is simply
no longer valid when the content industry has burgeoned on the back of investment by
industry in new devices, distribution platforms, etc., that some sectors of the content
industry should be artificially supported by consumers or device manufacturers and
providers.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
Following from the response to Question 65, DIF considers that the use of levies should not
be extended (and should be repealed). Contractual arrangements underpin many (if not
most) of the circumstances where content is available via the cloud to different devices (see
for example, UltraViolet) in which case the cost of copying the copyright work for private
purposes has already been incorporated into the contractual arrangement. Any levy would
constitute an unjustifiable double payment. There may be circumstances in which such
contractual underpinnings are not in place (e.g., ugc). However, the solution in those cases
does not lie in the widespread application of copyright levies.

67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?60_

YES As a matter of principle the visibility of taxes is a good idea. However, where a device is
not sold (but is rented or provided for free) the tax would not be visible. Such a system has
the potential to be distortionary and thus requires further analysis.
