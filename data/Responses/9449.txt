     Response of the European Magazine Media Association (EMMA) to the
   European Commission consultation on the review of the EU Copyright Rules
                                           5 March 2014



Name: European Magazine Media Association (EMMA)

EMMA, the European Magazine Media Association, is the unique and complete representation of
Europe’s magazine media, which is today enjoyed by millions of European consumers on various
platforms, encompassing both paper and digital formats.

EMMA represents 15,000 publishing houses, publishing 50,000 magazine titles across Europe in print
and digital. EMMA members comprise 24 national associations, 5 international associations, and 23
corporate members.

Type of respondent: Representative of publishers

Introductory comments:

The professional content produced by Europe’s magazine media, as well as providing information on
all topics that are relevant for society, constitutes an important element in the shaping of public
opinion that is essential in a democracy.

This high-value quality content costs a significant amount of money to produce, so effective copyright
protection is key to securing the independent journalism, comment and analysis that are fundamental
elements of any democracy. Publishers must be able to rely on copyright protection to secure
remuneration for their investment and for the sustainable delivery of creative content.

Magazine publishers want to be able to continue providing consumers with innovative, professional
content, but need to be able to continue to monetise content, otherwise current business models will
not be sustainable. They need revenue to be able to produce quality content.

It is key that publishers continue to be able to decide to whom they make their content available and
under what conditions. It should not be the other way around, that people can “free ride” and even
make money off the back of publishers’ content (e.g., like search engines and aggregators).

Magazine publishers believe that current copyright rules are broadly fit for purpose and any further
exceptions to copyright rules should be rejected, as they pose a direct threat to publishers’ economic
sustainability and their ability to develop digital business models.

As the Licences for Europe initiative demonstrated, there are already many licensing options available
and more being developed and the EU is now actively supporting and funding market-led work
making it even easier for people to find out who owns rights, what they are allowed to do with the
content (and at what price).

It is important that the EU does not allow a weakening of copyright law, as doing so would pose a risk
to Europe’s magazine media being able to continue producing the trusted, quality content their readers
enjoy and would therefore threaten media diversity.
                                                                                                    1
    I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market



A.      The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation
of the market through licensing agreements


3.        How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the
type of content concerned.
Magazine publishers generally manage their rights (digital and analogue) on an individual basis
whenever feasible or possible. Sometimes it is decided that an RRO could better manage these rights
collectively.
Magazines are distributed across multiple territories and are available across Europe. No problems
have been identified as regards cross border access to magazines or portabilty in this regard.
Licences are increasingly secured to allow for worldwide dissemination.
Initiatives within the UK such as the Copyright Hub aim to minimise the costs of clearing rights to a
minimum and will further facilitate requests for licences to be considered and for those making
enquiries to receive a clear “Yes” “No” or “Yes if” response.


4.        If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what would
be the best way to tackle them?
We have not identified any particular problems in the magazine sector.


5.       Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions
on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content is not possible
in certain European countries)?
X YES
It is important that rightholders have choices about how to best licence their rights, in order to reach
their primary and secondary markets effectively. It is important that rightholders continue to have the
possibility to decide on which markets their content is made available.
There are not always sound commercial reasons to have content available in all territories or to do so
immediately. Additional considerations include the costs of translation or additional services to attract
an audience in a particular Member State. Furthermore, there are also specific regulations at national
level (e.g., concerning defamation, taxation etc.) that must also be taken into account.
It would be damaging to the creative economy if regulation was imposed as regards how rightholders
might choose to exploit these rights.


7.      Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the
Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


                                                                                                        2
X NO


The current legislative framework does not hinder cross border licensing in the magazine sector. In
fact, to the contrary, the current framework enables publishers to make their content available across
borders as they choose to do so.
While there does not appear to be a large demand for cross-border licensing in the magazine market,
requests can be met via either licensing direct from the publisher, or – for secondary uses - via RROs
(Reproduction Rights Organisations). For example, a press publishing industry led initiative, Press
Database and Licensing Network (PDLN)1 is further facilitating the supply and use of press
information internationally, making licensing of press clippings across borders easier than ever.
We welcome the further development of market led solutions, which offer choice and diversity for
consumers and businesses in the digital environment. It is key for market development that there
continues to be an opportunity to offer choice in how a work is used (be this linked to a time period, to
permit copying, to reuse on other media etc.).



B.         The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions


      1. The act of “making available”


8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when content is
disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
X YES
It is key that acts of “communication to the public” continue to be able to be treated separately from
application of other restricted acts, depending on how a “communication” is received and how the
work received is reused beyond the communication itself. The re-use must continue to be subject to
national rules in the territory where the communication is received and “re-used” as regards the
relevant copyright-restricted acts. Any move towards a country of origin approach should be avoided.


9.      Could a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have an effect
on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether
you are considered to have transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the
enforcement of rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?
X YES
As set out above, we do not think that a clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available”
right is needed. Any clarification introducing a “country of origin” approach to the “making available”
right would have a very negative impact on rightholders by e.g., weakening the possibilities to address
a party based in one territory who has facilitated making a copy of an unauthorised reproduction made
by someone else in another territory.
There is a risk that legislative changes impacting the territorial scope of the “making available” right
could result in a ‘race to the bottom’, whereby people favouring the least amount of copyright
protection establish servers in countries with the weakest copyright laws. This would negatively
impact investment in cultural and creative content and pose a threat to the creative industries.

    2. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


10.    Does the application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online
environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?
x NO


    3. Linking and browsing

11.      Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected
under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?
X YES, in certain specific circumstances

Specifically, as in the Meltwater case2, where a hyperlink is comprised of or includes text protected as
the whole or part of a copyright work, the provision of a hyperlink would involve the reproduction of
the whole or part of a copyright work. In this case, the UK Court of Appeal3 held that users of
Meltwater’s news aggregation service required a licence (from NLA) in order to be able to receive and
read news snippets.

The Copiepresse v Google case in Belgium, where the court considered use of newspaper content on
Google News as infringing copyright, is also of relevance in this regard.


12.      Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of a work
or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory of the
user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

X YES, in certain specific cicumstances

Owners of websites more often than not want citizens to visit their website to read the material
provided, and therefore allow for them to make screen/cache copies of the page when web browsing
via an implied or express licence. Accessing content on a website – which involves making a
temporary copy of a work or other subject matter – should be subject to rightholder authorisation like
accessing a copy of a work or other subject matter e.g., received by email would be. Rightholders
should be able to continue to decide to refuse or charge for a licence e.g., for any commerical use of
the content.

                                                                                                      4
In the Meltwater case, the UK Court of Appeal4 held that users of Meltwater’s news aggregation
service required a licence (from NLA) in order to be able to receive and read news snippets largely on
the ground that making copies, “however temporary, in the end-user’s computer while browsing was
not part of the technological process but generated by the user’s voluntary decision to access the
web-page”.

Furthermore, allowing users to access content via websites which don’t have a licence – and with the
potential for lost revenue that this would entail - would conflict with the “three step test” established
under international and European law5, given the conflict with the normal exploitation of a work and
the unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interest of the rightholders (which Article 5(5) of the
Copyright Directive makes clear should not be the result of the limited exception for certain temporary
copies in Article 5(1)).


      4. Download to own digital content


14.     What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of
previously purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
As regards digital magazine content, which most publishers now offer to their readers as well as – or
as an alternative to – print, a legal framework enabling resale of previously purchased digital content
would pose a major threat to magazine publishing businesses, which already face a multitude of
challenges such as piracy and the detrimental practices of dominant global players.
Such a resale right would certainly undermine the primary market, e.g., by negatively impacting prices
and reducing incentives to invest in magazine content, and result in loss of revenues. The outcome
would ultimately negatively impact media pluralism.
It should remain up to a rightholder to decide on how their content can be used by others.


C.       Registration of works and other subject matter


15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
X NO, except perhaps in the case of a voluntary system
16.      What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
17.      What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
18.      What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


It is for good reason that existing international treaties prohibit formalities such as registration as a
condition for the protection and exercise of rights.

  Copyright Directive Article 5(5)

                                                                                                       5
Therefore, while a voluntary registration system could potentially aid in e.g., identifying rightholders,
any requirement or expectation to be registered in order to be sure of protection of rights would be
detrimental to rightholders. It is of concern that a registration system could be burdensome in terms of
administration, and while it might start off as being voluntary it could ultimately be made compulsory
or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.


D.          How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


19.      What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the content
sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions
databases?

We welcome the EU’s continued support, including funding, for the work of market led initiatives
which aim to develop further internet based solutions for the provision of legal access to and use of
content. A recent example is the Rights Data Integration (RDI) project6 which allows for automated
access to content rights and rights data across the internet. We do not think it would be appropriate for
there to be any legislative intervention however.


E.          Term of protection

20.         Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital environment?
X YES
The current terms of copyright protection are still appropriate. As explained in Directive 2006/116/EC
on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights, this term is sufficient to cover two
generations and provides a high level of protection of copyright and related rights which are
fundamental to intellectual creation. It also importantly underlines that this is intended to “ensure the
maintenance and development of creativity in the interest of authors, cultural industries, consumers
and society as a whole”.


      II.      Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions provided in
the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
X NO
As reflected in the Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC), there is a need for the legal framework to be
“general and flexible” in order to “foster the development of the information society in
Europe7”. Flexibility – in the form of optional limitations and exceptions - is important in order that
the copyright framework can meet the needs of individual member states, taking into account Europe’s
cultural diversity as well as the different legal traditions.


6
  http://www.rdi-project.org This will “demonstrate how supply chain participants can manage and trade rights
for any and all types of usage across any and all types of content (physical, digital or abstract) in any and all
media under any (or no) commercial model, and to support the provision of information to users.”

  Recital 2

                                                                                                                    6
The Copyright Directive recognises the importance of copyright and related rights as they “protect
and stimulate the development and marketing of new products and services and the creation and
exploitation of their creative content8.”
Europe’s creative industries have indeed been able to thrive within the framework of the current
Directive, which also incentivises further investment. The significance of IPR for Europe’s economy
was recently underlined in a study9 by the EC, OHIM and EPO, which revealed that IPR intensive
industries contribute 39% of the EU’s GDP and 26% of the EU’s employment, with 90% of its exports
coming from IP intensive industries.



22.      Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for a higher
level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
X NO
The Copyright Directive underlines that “any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take
as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation”.
Furthermore, it states that “their protection helps to “ensure the maintenance and development of
creativity in the interests of authors, performers, consumers, culture, industry and the public at
large.”
There is no evidence that making exceptions mandatory and having a higher level of
harmonisation would benefit intellectual creation in Europe, to the benefit of the various interests
concerned. Furthermore, the cultural differences across Europe themselves impose different
exceptions.
As set out in the answer to Q 21, we believe that the current system with optional exceptions
remains the right one as it provides the necessary flexibility for creative industries such as
Europe’s hugely diverse magazine media sector to thrive, and to continue to deliver to consumers
across Europe innovative, interesting new offerings on a variety of platforms.



23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
NO
We believe that the focus should be on proper implementation of the current exceptions, rather
than looking to add new exceptions and limitations.
Additional limitations and exceptions would run the risk of further threatening publishers’ economic
sustainability and their ability to continue producing the trusted, quality content their readers
currently enjoy. They would also impact their ability to develop new business models and ultimately
threaten media diversity. We do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to warrant any such
additional limitations and exceptions.
The Licences for Europe initiative has demonstrated that joint stakeholder action to further facilitate
access to copyright protected works across Europe is an important way of achieving outcomes that can
benefit both the creative industries and the European citizens that benefit from their innovation.

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater degree of
flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
X NO
The current framework of limitations and exceptions allows for adequate flexibility. We would oppose
the introduction of a US style “fair use” provision (which relies on litigation and has developed via
case law spanning several decades), which would result in a high level of legal uncertainty if applied
in the EU’s 28 Member States.


26.     Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
X NO
We are not aware of any particular problems for magazine publishers as a result of the territoriality of
limitations and exceptions. As set out in previous questions, the flexibility provided by the Directive,
which allows for the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, is important in order that the copyright
framework can meet the needs of individual member states, taking into account Europe’s cultural
diversity.


A.       Access to content in libraries and archives


1.       Preservation and archiving


28.
(b) Have you experienced problems with the use by libraries, educational establishments, museum
or archives of the preservation exception?
X NO
We are not aware of any specific problems concerning the preservation and archiving exception.
However, there is concern that once works are digitised by libraries etc. there could be pressure to
make these works available to the public, thereby endangering publishers’ commercial offers.




      2. Off-premises access to library collections


32.
(c) Have you negotiated agreements with institutional users that enable those institutions to provide
remote access, including across borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections,
for purposes of research and private study?

We understand that such agreements have been negotiated by publishers e.g. with libraries.
Furthermore, we understand that RROs in different Member States negotiate agreements with
libraries, enabling them to provide remote access to - as well as document delivery of - text and
image works, including across borders.

                                                                                                         8
It is important that rightholders should continue to be able to authorise of off-premises online
consultation of works and make appropriate agreements with libraries/universities (rather than this
being set out in law).


33.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We are not aware of any specific problems, however, there is a concern that where libraries have
digital copies they will want to provide off-premises access which would be detrimental to publishers.
It is important that this sort of remote access is agreed in a licensing agreements – and not in
legislation - and does not prejudice rightholders’ exploitation of their own publications, including
magazine publishers.


34.      If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under which conditions?
We do not believe that a legislative solution is needed.


      3. E – lending


36.
 (c) Have you negotiated agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books or other materials
electronically, including across borders?
X NO
EMMA has never been involved in these sorts of negotiations.



37.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

We are not aware of any specific problems at present as regards magazines. However, the
extension of the current framework to cover digital e-lending poses the risk that such an activity could
prejudice rightholders’ exploitation of their own publications, including magazine publishers. It is
particularly important that terms of any e-lending activities are agreed contractually in advance
between libraries etc. and rightholders.


39.     What difference do you see between libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises
consultation or public lending and activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance)
consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?


Selling access to copyright protected works is part of publishers’ business models and therefore e-
lending by libraries without licence / authorisation is more likely to conflict with the “three step test”
set out in international and European law, in particular insofar as it conflicts with normal exploitation
of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholder.
It is therefore very important as set out above that any such e-lending is agreed contractually by
licence agreements with the rightholder in advance.

                                                                                                        9
      4. Mass digitisation


40.     Would it be necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the
2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
X NO
Mass digitisation of magazine content by libraries and other entities can potentially have a negative
impact on the development of publishers’ digital business models and the possibility for them to
monitise content.
The 2011 MoU did not include magazine publishers, in light of the fact that press archives are not
considered to be “out of commerce”, but an increasingly important source of revenue for publishers.


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for other types
of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
X NO




B.       Teaching
42.
(b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?
X NO
We are not aware of any specific cases of problematic use of magazines for “illustration” for teaching.

43.      If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Licensing agreements are the most pragmatic way forward in addressing problems, rather than e.g.,
legislation. They also help reinforce societal understanding that works have a value and that using
others’ works should therefore need a licence / authorisation.


44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for illustration
for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
Publishers’ individual licensing schemes are used extensively by e.g., the scientific and research
communities (also together with collective licensing schemes offered by RROs), for print as well as
online use.
One outcome of the Licences for Europe (Working Group 2) was the development of a “toolkit”
setting out examples of tools currently available by RROs and other CMOs to legally use copyright
protected text and image works, including for education10.

                                                                                                                   10
46.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
We believe that licensing solutions, both individual licensing schemes by publishers together with
collective management schemes, provide the most suitable, flexible solution in order to provide broad,
tailor-made, legal access to content for teachers and researchers. Legislation on the other hand takes
years to agree and implement and cannot keep pace with fast-changing technologies in the same way
that licensing can.



C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC11 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their national laws
a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open formulation of this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level.

47.
(b) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the way in which works or other subject-
matter are used in the context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
X NO
While there are generally no major problems, for some publishers lack of consistency in provisions on
fair compensation for non-commercial research across the EU has been an issue.


48.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
Licensing – rather a legislative approach - is the most appropriate way forward.


49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for research
purposes? How successful are they?
Publishers offer licensing to allow use of copyright protected material for research purposes - as do
RROs for certain uses of copyright protected works – which is becoming increasingly efficient with
technological developments.


D.         Disabilities
50.
(c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the application of limitations or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication of works published in special formats,
including across borders?
X NO

     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                   11
52.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content? How
successful are they?
As well as the exceptions and limitations currently in place in all EU Member States favouring blind,
visually impaired or otherwise print disabled, coupled with the WIPO (Marrakesh12) Treaty, which can
now be implemented by Member States, RROs also offer licenses to facilitate access to copyright
protected works for these groups. Cross-border licensing agreements are provided by RROs in e.g.,
the UK, Austria and Germany. Stakeholders are also working together at EU- and international level
to enhance access via the respective ETIN (EC-supported) and TIGAR (WIPO-supported) projects13.


E.      Text and data mining


53.
(c) Have you experienced specific problems resulting from the use of text and data mining in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?
X NO
We do not understand there to be any obstacles to using text and data mining methods. During the
‘Licences for Europe’ Working Group 4 (WG4) on text and data mining (TDM) for scientific research
purposes, there was no evidence of market failure. Several participants presented a range of practical
and innovative solutions facilitating effective TDM in this regard, which represent the result of
major investment by the publishing industry and the licensing organisations with whom they work.
Some of these initiatives are already successfully being used by publishers and researchers, while
others are being launched or piloted with a view to being launched in the coming months.

These initiatives include a sample licence clause, presented by the International Association of
Scientific, Technical and Medical publishers (STM), which allows publishers to easily provide a
quick answer to requests made by the scientific community to be able to text and data mine content for
which they have a subscription14.

Other initiatives include PLS Clear, a digital clearing house initiative from the UK’s Publishers
Licensing Society (PLS) developed with the assistance of a group of leading publishers and
researchers, which connects researchers and publishers to further simplify TDM. Crossref’s Prospect
initiative shows that thanks to technical innovations TDM for research for non-commercial purposes is
possible via a click-through licence, and with simultaneous access to cross-publisher content in one
standardized format, as is the Copyright Clearance Centre’s (CCC) pilot TDM service concerning
both subscribed and non-subscribed content for commercial researchers, set for commercial release in
2014. “PDR” licences have also been successfully developed for the pharmaceutical industry for
commercial uses.

54.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
We are not aware of any problems, but we would say that licences are the way forward, as set out
above, rather than introducing a new exception for TDM. One concern for press publishers is that such
an exception could be misused, for example by news aggregators and media monitoring companies in
order to avoid getting a licence for their activities.


56.     If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
Publishers continue to be open to discussing and finding licensing solutions together with the
research community, to facilitate text and data mining with the potential to further research. As set
out in the response to Q53, publishers and researchers are already benefiting from the solutions which
have been developed to date. We welcome these innovative solutions and the continued work in this
field and believe that this non-legislative approach represents the most constructive way forward
for both the researchers and publishers concerned.

It is clearly for the mutual benefit of both publishers of content and miners to find licensing
solutions which permit researchers to mine works and allow them to do so as seamlessly and easily as
possible, while securing the publishers’ investments in their publications.

It is important that potential miners continue to engage with the publishers to achieve the best
outcome for their research, given that the different platforms used by publishers have different
capabilities and given that it is important to avoid any potential disruption or degradation to these
platforms, which is possible when unmanaged mining takes place without publisher support.

It is also important to underline that it is critical for the long-term sustainability of the research and
publishing communities that the end results of any research must not become a substitute for the
published content, which would jeopardise the authoritative content that publishers provide which
helps research to advance. It should remain up to rightholders to decide how their content may or
may not be re-used by others.



57.    Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of text or
data mining methods?
One problematic issue seems to be the fact that many of those researchers that apparently want to carry
out TDM are not in fact approaching publishers or the organisations such as those mentioned in our
response to Q53, in order to try and facilitate the TDM process.


F.      User-generated content


58.
 (c) Have you experienced problems resulting from the way the users are using pre-existing works
or other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the Internet, including across borders?


X NO



                                                                                                       13
To our knowledge, no specific problems have been raised by users in the context of being refused
permission to use press publishers’ content for UGC. In fact, we understand that press publishers
contacted by users who wish to use their content typically provide licences for use of the content
often for free, as long as it is not for commercial exploitation. Publishers also make it easy for readers
to share content, for example via Facebook. In the digital environment, press publishers also started
using more straight forward digital solutions to share their content legally and as widely as possible15.
The perspective of magazine publishers is set out in the joint pledge (6) on behalf of EMMA, ENPA
                                                                                16
and EPC: “User Generated Content: press publishers engaging with their readers ”. UGC in the press-
publishing sector concerns on the one hand what users do with publishers’ content and on the other
how publishers then choose to interact with that content.
More generally speaking, Licences for Europe demonstrated that licensing schemes are increasingly
available, including micro-licences concluded between rightholders and users generating the content17.


59.     (a) Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work you have created
(on the basis of pre-existing works) is properly identified for online use? Are proprietary systems
sufficient in this context?
X NO, we are not aware of specific examples of problems as regards identification of works for online
use – proprietary systems are sufficient in this context.

However, pledge 5 (of the 10 Licences for Europe pledges) on “Enabling the identification of
your work and rights online: an industry roadmap” will help creators – "self-publishers" – be able
to attach a machine-readable identification to their content, in order to facilitate claims and
acknowledgement of authorship and associated rights. This will make it easier to use (and re-use)
content.”

Furthermore, as this pledge explains, “through more national and regional “hub” websites, like the
new industry-led Copyright Hub in the UK, industry will accelerate the development of an efficient
market helping users to get the licences they need”.




60.    (a) Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work
you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
NO


61.        If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
As set out above, magazine publishers use licensing solutions (see further details set out in the
Licences for Europe 10 pledges). We do not perceive UGC as a problem as such. The need for any
legislative action in this field to e.g., introduce an exception, has not been proven.



15
     These solutions include for example the Press Database and Licensing Network (PDLN) (see
http://www.pdln.info), as well as the Copyright Clearance Centre (CCC) (see http://www.copyright.com/rightsphere), both of
which were presented during the L4E process

                                                                                                                       14
It should be noted in light of discussions about what UGC means, that it is important to distinguish
new original work created by a “non-professional” and existing works which such a person either
“copies”, or reuses, or “adapts” for the purposes of publishing a new composite work. It is important
that the public is properly educated about these distinctions.


62.      If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main elements? Which
activities should be covered and under what conditions?
Not applicable

63.         If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
As set out in our response to Question 58, press publishers contacted by users who wish to use their
content typically provide licences for use of the content often for free, as long as it is not for
commercial exploitation.
While we don’t perceive there to be “problems” per se in the area of UGC for the magazine publishing
sector, our pledge “User Generated Content: press publishers engaging with their readers18” contains a
Declaration on improving the user experience. This sets out that press publishers are committed to –
and continue to be committed to - engaging with readers and improving the user experience, including
via the uptake of User Generated Content (UGC) in their online publications and services, giving a
voice to users as well as enhancing their professional content offering. This is very much in the
interests of both publishers and users alike.
In this regard, we declared the importance of the following (see further details in the pledge):

1. Improving the user experience and involvement
2. Improving information about both what users can do with press publishers’ content and what press
publishers can do with users’ content
3. Promoting education about intellectual property rights (IPR)
4. Promoting awareness of the technological possibilities to better identify and protect content
5. Sharing best practices across the sector




     III.      Private copying and reprography


      64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of the
          private copying and reprography exceptions19 in the digital environment?
X NO
It is not necessary to change the provisions of the Copyright Directive (5.2 a and 5.2 b), and it is
important that there continues to be a requirement that certain exceptions are only permissible where
fair compensation is provided to rightholders.

   Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                               15
65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of a service that
has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to
private copying levies?
In the VG WORT case (C-457/11-C460/11) the CJEU held that a possible consent by the copyright
holder to the copying of his work or other protected material in the context of the exceptions or
limitations provided for in the Copyright Directive (Article 5.2 and 5.3) has no effect on fair
remuneration payable under the exception.
Therefore remuneration paid to the author or publisher under a licence does not preclude them from
receiving the fair compensation for the exception or limitation. We understand that such copies may
therefore be covered by the levies, if provided for in national legislation.


66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g. services
based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different devices) impact
the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and rightholders’
revenue on the other?
Where the rightholder is remunerated for certain uses on the basis of copyright levies, the device and
storage medium remuneration is also payable if protected works are copied in connection with online
services (e.g. if works are downloaded from a cloud portal and stored on a PC or storage medium).


67.      Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products subject
to levies?
YES, generally speaking transparency is welcomed.


68.     Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in undue levy
payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods
or services?
X NO

We understand that as regards text and image levies the refund of device and storage medium
remuneration in the event of export is dealt with – without any particular problems arising in most
cases - by the responsible RRO.

This can however be contrasted with the reportedly serious problem of vendors of devices based in
another EU Member State refusing to pay levies20.


69.    What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural persons
for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue
payments? Please explain in detail the example you provide (type of products, type of transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).
We are not in a position to provide a detailed response to this question.

                                                                                                   16
   IV.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers


73.        Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in contracts)?
X NO
We believe that questions relating to fair remuneration should continue to be dealt with at national
level via contracts.


      V.      Respect for rights


75.     Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for infringements
of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
X YES
Civil enforcement needs to become quicker and cheaper, and it should be easier to identify infringers.
More generally, we need to improve the ability to enforce intellectual property rights and avoid third
parties making unlawful gains from copyright

The different possibilities to utilise content on the internet and via tablets make it very easy for third
parties, like aggregators, search engines and pirate sites, to use publishing houses’ creative content for
free, without authorization and remuneration of the publisher.

Infringers make money from advertisements carried on illegal websites and also charge for the
downloading of illegally obtained content. It is important that copyright draws the line between
reference to content and unauthorised re-use.

Aggregators of information and search engines should always ask the consent of publishers to
reproduce their articles. While these operators claim that publishers have the possibility to ask that
their articles are not re-published on their websites, we agree that this form of opt-out seems to be
contrary to the logic of copyright which supposes on the contrary an opt-in.


76.      In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers, payment
service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright infringements with a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?
As mentioned above, enforcement needs to become quicker and cheaper, and it should be easier to
identify infringers. At the same time, publishers provide valuable forums for expression, so a situation
must be avoided whereby a threat of liability will discourage intermediaries from allowing users to
comment online, which encourages the free expression and exchange of opinions that are vital for a
vibrant democracy.

As set out in the current legal framework, if a posting is illegal, it should be taken down, but an
intermediary should not be forced to monitor or even censor posts of users in general. A situation must
be avoided where access providers have unfettered powers to control content.



                                                                                                        17
We welcome however cross industry “follow the money” types of initiatives, which can play an
important role in addressing online copyright infringements.



77.      Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is achieved
between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the protection of
private life and protection of personal data?
X YES
It is important to find the right balance between respect for copyright and other rights as set out above.
The current civil enforcement framework largely finds this balance - and we would not therefore
propose an opening of the Enforcement Directive in this regard - while it is ultimately up to Member
States to implement it as they see fit.


       VI. A single EU Copyright Title


78.     Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means of
establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as
a single framework for enforcement?
X NO


79.      Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the current
level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer term project?
NO
We do not see this as being appropriate either as a next step or in the longer term, in light of our
previous comments relating to the flexibility that is needed, and the cultural differences that should be
respected in different Member States.


  VII.     Other issues


80.     Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for copyright?
Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
Please find annexed a joint press publishers position paper from EMMA and ENPA (the European
Newspaper Publishers’ Association) setting out an overview of the sector’s key concerns in light of
the current review of the copyright framework.




                                                                                                       18
ANNEX
European Commission consultation on the review of EU Copyright rules:
            Position of the European press publishers


ENPA, representing publishers of newspapers and news media in Europe and EMMA, the
European Magazine Media Association, would like to highlight some key concerns in light of
the current Commission consultation on the review of EU Copyright framework.

    Effective copyright protection is key to securing the independent journalism, news
     and analysis that are fundamental elements of any democracy

Press publishers must be able to rely on copyright protection to ensure remuneration for their
significant investment and for the sustainable delivery of the high-value, quality, professional
content they produce for Europe’s consumers and businesses. This content – delivered in
print and on a variety of digital platforms - represents a vital contribution towards building a
better-informed and engaged democratic society.

Press publishers need to be able to continue providing consumers with innovative,
professional content. For this to continue in a sustainable way, publishers need to monetise
content. It is therefore key, more than ever in the digital era, that publishers should
continue to be able to decide on the terms and conditions for managing, distributing
and making available their content.

    Importance of intellectual property rights (IPR) and the current legal framework for
     Europe’s economy and employment

The newspaper and magazine sectors in Europe employ the highest number of journalists
and employ almost 1 million people in local communities, generating around 76 billion Euros
annually, as well as driving employment in related sectors such as advertising, distribution
and printing. Publishers want to be able to continue delivering their readers quality,
professional content on all platforms and to be able to meet their demands.

The substantial investment of publishers in developing new business models to offer content
to consumers in innovative digital formats is based on the existing EU copyright framework,
which carefully balances rights, exceptions and limitations. At a time when the press sector
in Europe is transforming its structures and operations to the digital environment, any re-
opening of the EU Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) would lead to a period of
legal uncertainty that would undermine investments in the publishing sector.

The significance of intellectual property rights (IPR) for Europe’s economy was recently
underlined in a study21 by the OHIM and EPO, in cooperation with the Commission, which
revealed that IPR intensive industries contribute 39% of the EU’s GDP and 26% of the EU’s
employment, with 90% of its exports coming from IP intensive industries.



21
  See report by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the Office of Harmonization for the Internal Market
(OHIM)


                                                                                                           19
It is therefore of vital importance that the crucial decision on the future of a new copyright
framework is taken in full knowledge of the actual economic impact and the necessary
time is taken to analyse the various studies which have been commissioned (some of which
are still pending).

    The current framework of limitations and exceptions provides the flexibility needed
     to take into account Europe’s cultural diversity and different legal traditions

As reflected in the Infosoc Directive, there is a need for the legal framework to be “general
and flexible” in order to “foster the development of the information society in Europe 22”. We
support the flexibility of the current system – with optional limitations and exceptions
– as a balanced solution, which meets the needs of individual Member States. The current
framework takes into account Europe’s cultural diversity and the different legal traditions,
while allowing the press sector, amongst others, to deliver innovative new offerings to
consumers and businesses across Europe on a variety of platforms.

We believe that there is no clear evidence of the need to introduce any new exceptions
and limitations to copyright. As the Commission’s ‘Licences for Europe’ initiative (where
ENPA and EMMA were active participants) demonstrated, licensing mechanisms are
already actively in use on the market23 - with more still being developed as technological
advances are made – to facilitate for example e.g., text and data mining (TDM)24 and user-
generated content (UGC)25. Publishers continue to develop more efficient licensing solutions
together with users.

From the perspective of press publishers, any potential exception for TDM could be misused
by, for example, news aggregators and media monitoring companies in order to avoid the
necessity of licensing their activities. Furthermore, publishers should retain the right to
decide how their content may or may not be re-used by others. It is essential to the long-term
sustainability of the publishing sector that the end results of any research do not become a
substitute for the published content. This would inevitably jeopardise continued investment
by publishers in authoritative content, which in turn helps to promote advances in research.

    Digitisation has not reduced but increased the need for copyright protection
     together with better enforcement

One of the challenges facing newspaper and magazine publishers in the digital environment
is how to ensure that technology companies, news aggregators and other third parties do not
extract the value of their content, without remuneration for those who created or invested in
that content. Effective IPR enforcement mechanisms and procedures are essential to combat
both piracy and parasitism; as well as to ensure that rights holders and society at large can
fully enjoy the benefits of the IP system. It is therefore crucial that copyright draws the line
between reference to content and unauthorised re-use.

In addition, rightholders should continue to be able to authorise and make appropriate
agreements with libraries/universities to allow for off-premises online consultation of
works (rather than this being set out in law). It is furthermore important to avoid any change
to the legal framework to enable the resale of previously purchased digital content (in the
same way as physical content) which would destroy the primary market.

   Conclusion

It is vital for the press sector that the current review of the Infosoc Directive - which has
served as a basis for publishers’ considerable investment in developing innovative digital
offers such as interactive websites, applications for tablets and news services to mobile
devices – does not result in a weakening of the protection of publishers’ content.

The European Commission itself is actively supporting and funding market-led work making it
even easier for people to find out who owns rights, what they are allowed to do with the
content and at what price. We believe that it is important for the EU to encourage the many
market-led initiatives which our industry has heavily invested in, and which are already being
put into practice with success, and allow them to come to fruition before launching into a
legislative process which would risk jeopardising the progress made in the digital economy.

We trust that these considerations will be taken into account when the current copyright
framework is debated within the European Commission.
