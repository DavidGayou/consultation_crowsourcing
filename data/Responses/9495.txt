            I. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

1.           [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which
you live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual


                                                                                                2
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)
  NO
  NO OPINION




2.           [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when
seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).
  NO
  NO OPINION




3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
Within the last few years Copydan Writing has received a few enquiries regarding multi-
territorial licensing, however it is no more than a maximum of 2-3 enquiries per year.
Most requests concerns small periodicals wanting to digitize and make available their old
releases where the rights to digitize and make available has not been part of the parties
contract. The request could also have been made by a library.




4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]




In Copydan Writing’s point of view, based on the number of enquiries received, the multi-
territoriality does not constitute a significant problem. Danish is a small scale language why
the demand for cross-border is next to non.



                                                                                            3
The legal foundation in the general extended collective licence provision (DCA sec 50(2)) to
enter into licenses regarding digitizing and making available old releases of periodicals for the
use in Denmark already exists. Copydan Writing’s licenses are as a result extended to
covering non-represented rightsholders as well as represented rightsholders within a specified
type of use for literary works.

 The enquiries received concerning multi-territorial licenses are often small scale and made by
small periodicals where the editing staff often is voluntary workers. As a result funding
constitutes an even bigger problem than clearing rights.

Copydan Writing can license the mass digitizing and making available for use in Denmark. In
case Copydan Writing should carry mandates from rightsholders for multi-territorial licenses,
then the problem is solely the non-represented rightsholders.



5.             [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights
for all the territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose
territorial restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to
certain content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
  NO OPINION




6.            [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there
reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to
a different website than the one he is trying to access)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
  NO OPINION


7.           Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including
market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of
content services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for
right holders?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION



                                                                                               4
 What should be remembered is that copyright actually gives solutions to a number of
problems that would otherwise be left to law of contracts.

In the above mentioned case concerning periodicals if it instead was a library behind the
project, then a means to solve the cross border problem could be for the European Union to
follow up on the Memorandum of Understanding for Out-of-Commerce Works


8.          Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e.
when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
   YES
   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach)
  NO OPINION


The questions that might arise are best answered through case law in the EU Court of Justice
which will take into regard specificities of different situations which is not suitable for
legislative solution.




9.           [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial
scope of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief)?
  YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
  NO
  NO OPINION
10.          [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application
of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a
download) create problems for you?
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")
  NO
  NO OPINION




11.          Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?


                                                                                                    5
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
  NO OPINION


12.         Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and
in the cache memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)
  NO OPINION




13.          [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions
when trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
  NO
  NO OPINION




14.         [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be
the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously
purchased digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
15.           Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION




16.     What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


                                                                                            6
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?
[Open question]

Under current international copyright legislation, registration cannot be made compulsory or
constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights. A registry could be
established on a voluntary basis.

In relation to works existing prior to the creation of such a system, vast funds would be
required, in order to have a covering registry.

The registry would not be operational before a very large share of the enormous number of
existing works had entered into the system. Even then, the creation of an EU system could
lead to a defacto “formality” for the protection of a work, as users could deny payment for the
use of rights, in cases where works have not been registered or single contributors in a work
has wrongly not been registered. It is not feasible that a system could be accurate and
operational enough to justify the enormous cost of establishing it.



18.    What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

19.         What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in
the content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights
ownership and permissions databases?
[Open question]

It is important to ensure that rightsholders receive remuneration for the use of their works
why identifiers is a useful tool.

As a member of Ifrro (International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations),
Copydan Writing supports the work with identifiers in projects such as ARROW, ISNI and
ISTC.



                                                                                             7
Copydan Writing has developed a rightsholder register as a means to identify rightsholders
and ensure correct distribution when we remunerate rightsholders individually for licensees’
use of their works in regards to the licensees agreement with Copydan Writing.

For copying in the educational sector in the school year 2012/2013 Copydan distributed
remuneration to more than 20,000 Danish rightsholders based on that register.

The EC are already involved in the work and the EC should continue to support the work with
identifiers and transparency by funding, sponsoring or by other means.

20.        Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
  YES – Please explain
  NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
  NO OPINION



   II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.          Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION


22.          Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a
need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
  NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION


Exceptions, in a broad view, damage the cultural production as content creators loose
encouragement to create new works. Exceptions to copyright should only be applied as a
measure of last resort and licensing should be the preferred solution. In different member
states different levels of licensing tools and solutions exist. We think the best approach is to
seek to strengthen licensing solutions though positive and constructive initiatives such as
licensing for Europe. Creating mandatory exceptions on the other hand, would damage
existing licensing models and thus damage the creation of jobs in the creative sector.


23.           Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the
existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

                                                                                              8

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
  NO – Please explain why
  NO OPINION



25.           If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g.
interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives,
interpretations by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair
dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative
advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the
functioning of the Internal Market.
[Open question]


A fair use exception does not fit with the European law tradition. Even in the USA, where
common law is used, significant uncertainties still prevail, especially regarding new forms of
use, even with decades of judgments concerning fair use. Periodic revision would be a
problem as well, as revising the law could disrupt the perceived balance of thousands and
thousands of contract concerning rights. Copydan Writing believes that specific exceptions
combined with flexible licensing solutions will meet the demands of users, rightsholders and
the market better than a general fair use exception.



26.           Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience,
constitute a problem?
  YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
  NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
  NO OPINION
27.          In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were
to have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
  YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….



31.          If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]


Licensing, both individual and collective licensing provides a more flexible solution to both
users and rightsholders. That was also a conclusion in the Commission’s Licences for Europe
project.




32.          (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced
specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you
to provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in

                                                                                           10
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]


Collections in national institutes are often in the national language. Therefore there is no
significant demand for access to Danish collections from other countries. In Denmark, there
are numerous agreements regarding the mass use in libraries and archives. The general ECL
provision in the Danish Copyright Act can be used as the legal foundation for an agreement
between an institutional user and Copydan Writing (or another CMO) for giving access to a
collection or parts thereof.
It is mentioned in the explanatory notes to article 50,2, that the provision can be applied when
wanting to digitize cultural heritage.



33.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


The orphan works directive is being implemented in member states, and relevant stakeholders
have agreed upon key principles on digitizing and making available of out-of-commerce
works in 2011 MoU. There should be a follow up on the cross border availability as regards
the 2011 MoU

(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
  YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
   NO – Please explain
  NO OPINION
With the 2008 amendment to the Danish Copyright Act introducing the general ECL
provision (sec. 50(2)), users such as libraries and collecting societies were enabled to enter
into mass digitization projects. The provision was introduced as a means to help facilitate
digitizing the Danish cultural heritages and mass digitization projects which include orphan
works. Since 2008 Copydan Writing has entered into a number of licenses regarding mass
digitization and making available.
The licenses that are based on the ECL system cover the use of works in Denmark. Such ECL
licenses are limited to national use, because the extended collective licensing (ECL) only
applies within the Danish territory. To be able to give such licenses cross-border effect, it
would require that licenses based on ECL or other forms of collective rights management
issued in one member state to be recognized in other member states.


41.         Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed
for other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’
archives)?

42.            (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:]
Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter

(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain
  NO
  NO OPINION


In Denmark, the system of ECL licensing agreements with schools, universities etc. functions
very well to the benefit for both rightsholders and educational institutions. Licensing means
flexibility and avoidance of uncertainty regarding the understanding of an exception limited to
“illustration” for educational purposes.




                                                                                            13
43.          If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]


In our experience, collective licensing facilitates easy and straight forward access to content,
while ensuring the rightsholders are remunerated for the exploitation of their works.


44.            What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]


In Denmark, we apply extended collective licensing (ECL). Because ECL based licenses
include all works of all artists of a defined type it can provide the broadest possible access to
use of content and a high level of legal security for the users. At the same time it provides
rightsholders with fair remuneration for the exploitation of their works and support that
content creators are able and encouraged to continue creating new works. The system is
accepted by both educational institutions and rightsholders and has been for many years,
which is the best testimony of its success.
The use of the ECL is consequently very successful, and enables Copydan Writing to clear the
rights for a lot of different uses in schools. The agreements are very successful, and the main
licenses cover almost 100 % of all schools in Denmark.
 The ECL system is a way of managing rights in organized form and is not to be seen as an
exception.
As Copydan Writing licenses on the basis of the ECL system the uncertainty in regards to the
scope of “illustration for teaching” is avoided. It is worth mentioning that there has not been
need for settling of disputes in a court of law. All matters have been solved amongst the
parties and if necessary it is possible to bring questions on the fee of the license before the
Copyright License Tribunal. There haven’t been any cases before the tribunal in recent years.
Funds are important for the possibility of producing and distributing new creative content to
the benefit of the educational system.
The development of the licenses is ongoing and occurs through continued discussions with
the educational sector and the rightsholder organizations.
All licenses allow the institutions to copy for educational purposes and for internal
administrative use.
