1. Introduction

The Law Society of England and Wales is the independent professional body,
established for solicitors in 1825, that works globally to support and represent its
166,000 members, promoting the highest professional standards and the rule of law.

This submission has been prepared by the Society's working group of IP specialist
solicitors who act for all types of stakeholders who create, own, use or make
available copyright works. On a number of the issues raised in the consultation, it is
not possible to express a single view as the answer would depend on your
perspective as either a right holder, user or third party. In this submission we
therefore focus on the issues where, through our professional experience, we believe
the current copyright regime creates unnecessary legal uncertainty and expense for
stakeholders and where the system could be improved to everyone's benefit.

The points we make in response to the consultation are more thematic than the
specific questions raised by the Consultation, though they touch on a number of
those questions. We have indicated below which of the consultation's questions each
theme may relate to.


2. Harmonisation (section A)

The EU copyright regime is, at best, semi-harmonised, unlike the regimes for most
other intellectual property rights. In particular, fundamental notions such as which
types of work are protectable by copyright and which defences may apply to
complaints of infringement, vary both conceptually and in detail between Member
States. This semi- harmonisation risks causing additional expense and complication
for all stakeholders. While there may be cultural reasons why differences between
Member States should remain in some areas, our view is that benefits would flow
from more fundamental attempts at harmonisation. From our point of view, the most
obvious benefit to stakeholders would be in reducing duplication of legal advice and
legal fees (and there may well be other benefits). The EU trade mark regime, for
example, has managed to create a relatively uniform approach across the EU even in
respect of national rights thanks to the European Trade Mark Directive1 and its
interpretation by the Courts. As a result clients are often able to obtain sufficient
advice from one lawyer rather than multiplying the cost of that advice across
numerous territories.

3. Which rights should be protected? (questions 11-12)

None of the EU Directives relating to copyright sets out exactly which rights should
be protected by copyright. Following the Infopaq2 decision there has been increasing
acceptance in Courts across the EU that copyright should protect artist's or author's
intellectual creations. In Infopaq this could amount to some eleven words and in
BSA3 it held that this extended to a computer game's graphical user interface. There
is not, in our view, any particular need to have a more specific definition of what
types of work should be protected than that it should be limited to the author's or
artist's intellectual creation. However, the United Kingdom persists in a different
approach, affording copyright protection to specific categories of work such as literary
works, artistic works, dramatic works etc. To the extent that a piece of work which is
clearly the author's intellectual creation does not fall within one of those specific
cases (for example, a computer games graphical user interface) the position before
the English Courts is unclear. Consequently, confusion reigns as judges and lawyers
are torn between following the UK statute and applying the Infopaq test. Unless the
EU takes steps to impose a unified approach, this uncertainty will persist as the UK
government shows little interest in effecting the necessary change.


4. Registration of Copyright (questions 15-18)

An interesting idea flagged in the consultation document is whether there should be
some form of European copyright register. Our view is that a mandatory register, or
one which is in effect mandatory because rights needs to be registered before
litigation can be undertaken, is unnecessary and likely to simply add extra expense
and burden with no clear benefit. However, it is the case that means of finding out
who owns a particular copyright work could be improved in some cases. In this
respect we support the work of the UK's Copyright Hub which is looking at some
interesting ideas for how the current position may be improved, both in human and
machine readable ways. We also note other industry-led initiatives such as the
Global Repertoire Database. In our view, these initiatives should be given time and
space to flourish before any consideration is given to introducing a mandatory
legislative solution.

We do have concerns about unofficial "registries" which exist in many Member States
on a commercial basis, providing a work with some sort of certificate as to its date of
creation. The benefits of such registries are unclear and we are concerned that some
unwitting copyright owners may unnecessarily be paying significant funds to such
registries for no real benefit.

5. The Term of Copyright and Related Rights (question 20)

The question of how long copyright should extend is a contentious one and one on
which our members' clients will have strongly differing positions. We do not express a
view as to whether the term of protection should be longer or shorter. However, the
question of term lengths should be looked at with a view to increasing consistency
between the various different regimes. In our view this should be extended to areas
such as unregistered design rights, where there is often a significant overlap with
copyright.


6. Exceptions (questions 21-27)

In the digital world, one of the most important facets of copyright law is the issue of
exceptions, those acts which are permitted in respect of copyright works. Article 5 of
the Information Society Directive does harmonise to some extent those exceptions
but not entirely. Due to the voluntary nature of several of the most important
exceptions, there is a different regime in each Member State. This inevitably
increases the costs to stakeholders in understanding the legal position across the
EU, through the need to take legal advice in each relevant Member State. The
differences manifest themselves both in terms of exactly which exceptions are
available (for example in the United Kingdom there is at the time of writing no
exception relating to parody, nor is there a right to make copies for private use) but
also in the way the exceptions are worded. Again, there is nowadays little logical
sense to this. In our view the situation would be improved if there were a mandatory
list of exceptions which could be developed by case law.

There is an issue about how the case law should be developed. The current system
of referring matters of European law ultimately to the Court of Justice is not
necessarily appropriate for a new exceptions regime which will need to be developed
rapidly. The Court of Justice is slow, and often answers the issues referred to it in an
opaque manner or only in part, frustrating the Courts' purpose of clarifying EU laws.

Instead of a new regime being subject to decisions of the Court of Justice, which will
inevitably delay the creation of a clear new regime because cases will take many
years to reach a final conclusion through this route, there may be scope for a new
form of tribunal which issues rapid decisions but on a pan-European basis. Thought
should be given to how the support mechanisms, in other words the legislative
bodies and the Courts, can best be organised so as to allow a new regime and clear
rules to develop quickly. While not an exact analogue, the way in which the ICANN
uniform domain name dispute resolution policy (UDRP) became understood and
broadly accepted, might be a good example as to how such disputes should both be
determined and how precedents should be set. The very clear rules set out in the
UDRP left relatively few questions open for interpretation and the rapid turnaround in
dealing with UDRP complaints quickly meant that practitioners could assimilate a
knowledge of how cases would be decided.

The position of the "three step test" in respect of copyright exceptions should be
clarified as a matter of EU law. It is part of the Berne Convention and as such should
be taken to account when assessing the scope of copyright exceptions. However, in
practice, this is often not done by the Courts, particularly in England and Wales,
because it is not so clearly a part of UK law4.


7. Enforcement (questions 75 and 76)

The consultation raises the question of whether civil enforcement may be improved.
As also raised in our previous response to the 2013 civil enforcement consultation,
we believe the system might be improved if judges with IP backgrounds and training
heard copyright cases. For example, in England and Wales, there are particular
patent courts and a specific commercial division of the Court hears intellectual
property cases. Having cases heard by judges with intellectual property experience
would facilitate judicial appreciation of technical copyright issues and would likely
improve the examination of claims, both in terms of validity of the right and whether
an infringement has taken place.

The system might also benefit from model rules for small claims proceedings for civil
law cases concerning infringements of intellectual property rights including copyright.
This would facilitate rights enforcement and encourage rights holders to enforce
those rights where lower values are at stake. The rules would also need to set a
proper standard of protection for defendants and a lowest common denominator
approach would need to be avoided. In addition to setting out clear procedures for
identification and service of defendants, defendants should be able to defend
themselves in their own language.

The Law Society considers that alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in the
case of IP rights infringements are reasonably accessible, although further work
could be done on publicising these to encourage them to be used more frequently

We understand the Commission is working on a Notice and Action initiative. With the
caveat of not knowing what form such an initiative might take and its further details,
we think such an initiative might prove helpful in bringing further clarity as national
regulations in this area differ. Such clarification would need to balance the interests
of the right holders with the freedom to share legal content and with the mere conduit
principle. The introduction of notification mechanisms whereby intermediaries such
as ISPs are informed that their services are or may be being used to infringe

  For example, Arnold J in Forensic Services v West Yorkshire at 113: "In the current state of the case
law of the Court of Justice, it is not clear to what extent the court must consider whether the application
of the exception or limitation relied on satisfies the three-test in the particular circumstances of the case
before it. Even if the court is required to conduct a three-step analysis, however, it seems clear that the
effect will not be to widen what amounts to fair dealing, but if anything to narrow it. It follows that, even if
I am required to conduct a three-step analysis, it would not alter the conclusion that the Defendants' use
was not fair dealing."

copyright for a commercial purpose might be helpful to facilitate consensual
settlements of disputes, within the framework of fundamental legal principles. This
would be useful in both national and cross-border cases.


8. A Single European Right (questions 78-79)

This issue is flagged in the EU consultation document. We believe it would probably
be impractical and its introduction would inevitably be heavily weighed down by legal
disputes. In addition, it is difficult to see why it might be necessary. Ownership of
rights is at present clear and the issues identified around licensing are essentially
mechanistic, and as such capable of being solved through new initiatives and a
better application of technology.


9. Certainty (questions 80)

The United Kingdom has been afflicted by a plethora of government consultations on
copyright over the past decade, in particular around the Gowers and Hargreaves
reviews. The upshot of all of these has been little real change to copyright laws, but
an enormous cost and distraction for stakeholders of all sorts. This does not,
however, discourage legislators from re-examining the same issues repeatedly. A
more unified EU copyright regime would hopefully reduce the need for such national
initiatives and allow for a better process for developing copyright law in a way which
keeps better time with technological developments.
