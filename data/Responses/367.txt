    * Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


    *  [In particular if you are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO


  NO OPINION





    * [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


  NO - Please  explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).

  NO OPINION





    * [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial

      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


Never.








    * If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….





    * [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


  YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO


  NO OPINION





    * [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?


  YES – Please explain by giving examples


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO


  NO OPINION





    * Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


  YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The act of “making available”


    *  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


  YES

  NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach)

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO OPINION




    * [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


  YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  NO OPINION


Linking and browsing

or under specific circumstances, and why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount

it should be covered by a copyright exception)


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO OPINION




    * Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be

[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

[Open question]


……………………………………………………………………………………………….

  YES – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


  NO OPINION


    * If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be

      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
