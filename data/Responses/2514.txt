Dear Madam/Sir,

On behalf of Eurimag, the association representing the European imaging and printing industry
(Brother, Canon, Dell, Epson, HP, and Lexmark), we would like to thank the European Commission for
giving us the opportunity to share our views on the review of the EU copyright rules.

Eurimag supports the submission to this consultation by DIGITALEUROPE, but with this letter, we
would like to share some additional thoughts, in particular with regards to the questions related to
reprography levies.

Eurimag believes that the reprography hardware levies system, as implemented in many EU Member
States, is not adapted to the digital age. The current levies system ignores the big emerging trends
such as the radical shift from analogue printed material to digital content. In the digital age, users
store and transfer content across multiple devices. They actually expect to be able to do so,
whenever they acquire content legally. However, only a limited part of such content is copyright
protected and as a consequence could probably not justify a levy on a device. All this and in
particular the criteria of harm as a base for defining a levy is not taken into account adequately in the
levies discussion.

Furthermore, we believe that the current EU levy system is disproportionate and unbalanced. As
identified in reputable academic studies1, levy collecting systems across Member States are
inconsistent, with dramatic differences between countries in the scope of the devices subject to a
levy, the setting of levy tariffs, and decision regarding the beneficiaries of the levy.

For example, regarding levied devices, we have the following: levies on blank media in 22 EU
Member States, on MP3 players in 18 Member States, on copiers/printers in 12 Member States, and
on personal computers in 4 Member States. In addition, in the case of reprography hardware, levy
collection equate to several times the EU per capita average. This is true of Belgium for instance,
where a multifunctional device with a copy speed of 20 to 39 pages per mi nute will attract a levy of
€195.60 as opposed to Germany, where the exact same product will be levied at and already high
€50. It should be noted that in a vast majority of EU countries, no levies are collected at all on
manufacturers of reprographic equipment.

Eurimag would like to stress that private copying and reprography levies are not the only way to
fairly remunerating authors. Several Member States have thus decided not to implement the
copyright exception through a levies collection system. Among them is the UK, which is arguably one
of the most “creative” countries in world. In addition, Spain recently decided to go for a state funded
system. A number of studies have been produced that look at alternatives to levies.

A major issue with reprography levies is that in some cases double payments can arise in cross-
border transactions. Manufacturers are at a major disadvantage when shipping their products to
another Member State, since sometimes they need to pay a levy in the country of manufacture and a
second time in the county of destination of the product. No refund system has yet proven to work
effectively. This goes against the spirit of the Single Market. Eurimag therefore strongly supports the
recommendation of Mr. António Vitorino, Commission mediator on private copying levies, to shift
the obligation to pay reprography levies from the manufacturer or importer level to the retailer level.

Shifting the obligation to pay the levy to the retailer would have three major advantages. First, this
would create a real Single Market for products subject to a reprography levy. Second, such a system
would avoid forum shopping by importers to countries with no or very low levies. This is also
detrimental to the rightsholders. Third, according to the Court of Justice of the European Union 2, no
levy is due in the case of professional use. Retailers are in a much better position than manufacturers
to determine whether the reprography hardware that is being sold to a customer is meant for private
or professional use.

Finally, we would like to highlight that we see an added value in making levies visible to the final
customer. We support Mr. Vitorino’s recommendation that making levies visible on invoices would
raise consumer awareness, create a more transparent system, and would also facilitate the collection
of levies by collecting societies.

Should you require any further clarifications on the above points, please do not hesitate to contact
us.

Yours sincerely,




Irena Bednarich,                                                        Maxime Furkel,
