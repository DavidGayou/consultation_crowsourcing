   I. Introduction

        I am responding on  behalf  of  FORTISSIMO  FILMS  to  the  European
Commission’s (the “Commission”) Public Consultation on the Review of the  EU
Copyright Rules.


        FORTISSIMO FILMS is headquartered in the European Union, and engaged
in the business of INTERNATIONAL FILM DISTRIBUTION.  We  have  responded  to
those  questions  that  have  clear  and  immediate  ramifications  for  our
business but we rely upon the trade bodies of our industry  to  put  forward
the necessary legal analysis on the more technical questions posed  in  this
Public Consultation.

   I.
  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?



[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?

( NO

Specific evidence produced by both content  owners/licensors  and  licensees
(e.g. online platforms, traditional broadcasters)  during  the  Commission’s
year-long “Licenses  for  Europe”  stakeholder  dialogue  in  2013  has  not
corroborated the assumption that consumers do not  have  legitimate  options
to access and view content across Europe. In fact, options for consumers  to
access audiovisual works online have never been  more  plentiful  throughout
the EU.[i]  The findings from “Licenses  for  Europe”  clearly  demonstrated
that there is not – at this point – a critical mass of consumer  demand  for
cross-border access to content. Absent significant consumer  demand,  it  is
not commercially viable for the private sector to  marshall  the  investment
capital and to take the economic risks to provide such pan-EU services.   It
is important to note that the EU copyright acquis does  not  prevent  multi-
territorial licensing and such licenses may emerge as and when  distributors
are in a position to guarantee effective and sustainable  exploitation  (and
financial compensation) throughout an expanded geographic area.

   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?

( NO

There are no legal or  regulatory  issues  that  prevent  rightholders  from
licensing rights to online services on a multi-territory basis. The fact  is
that most online content services cater to nationally and/or  linguistically
specific audiences owing to the localised nature of demand  for  content  in
the EU and, in particular, the consumers’ preference  for  viewing  versions
dubbed in the local language. As evidenced during the “Licences for  Europe”
stakeholder dialogue process, those aggregators and platforms  that  provide
content services in more than one EU country tend to have created  localized
services in each country, each  with  their  own  local  branding,  locally-
tailored  search  and  recommendation  profiles  and  marketing   strategies
designed to respond to the cultural  preferences  of  local  audiences.   On
this basis, rights are acquired separately for the different territories  in
which  they  are  operational  and  their  menu   of   titles   may   differ
substantially between the various national services.  This practice  enables
the online content services to control  their  costs  by  tailoring  content
acquisition and storage to a  culturally-specific  demand  by  a  particular
national audience.

   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.

Requests for multi-territory licenses are  extremely  rare,  except  in  the
case  of  recognized  regional  territory  groups  with   common   languages
(Benelux, Scandinavia, etc.). The most prevalent licensing model  throughout
the content industry is one where all rights  are  licensed  exclusively  to
various local distributors who will then maximize distribution  tailored  to
the market they service,  bearing  in  mind  the  local  culture  and  movie
consumption preferences.  This model benefits  consumers  by  providing  the
most options for legitimate access and  viewing  of  content.  Through  such
maximized exploitation by each licensed  distributor  (or  sub-distributor),
consumers benefit and  each  distributor  is  incentivized  to  service  its
licensed territory effectively.

The nature of  European  film  project  financing,  and  in  particular  its
organic linkage to territorially-exclusive rights  licensing  (pre-sales  of
rights against financing), makes it difficult for new and  recent  films  to
be exploited  in  a  multi-territory  structure  (or  sometimes  on  a  non-
exclusive basis)  without  causing  detriment  to  the  fine-tuned  economic
engine of new film production.  Additionally,  the  low  demand  for  multi-
territory licenses in audiovisual reflects the fact that there is  currently
no critical mass of EU consumers to drive such a change in  an  economically
sustainable form. Available data  show  local  audiences  generally  have  a
strong preference for  local  fare  and  for  big  ‘tentpole’  international
films.[ii]  To the extent that they are interested in European content  from
other countries, local consumers are also more responsive when such  content
is packaged and marketed specifically for their  national  market  by  local
distributors who will have acquired relevant territorial rights.

   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

N/A

   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?

( YES

There are valid reasons for rightholders to impose territorial  restrictions
on service providers,  even  in  cases  the  rightholder  controls  all  the
necessary  rights  for  all  the  territories  in  question.  Producers  and
distributors of audiovisual content fully negotiate territorial  limitations
to protect the exclusivity of the distributor in the geographic  area  where
the distributor is best able to maximize  exploitation  of  the  content  by
marketing and selling to local consumers.  This exclusivity and the  minimum
guarantees distributors pay to producers to  obtain  such  exclusivity  form
the foundation of  production  financing,  in  Europe,  and  throughout  the
world.

Territorial delineation in the exploitation of rights is  intimately  linked
to the  financing  of  new  popular  European  content  and  stimulates  its
circulation across borders. Independent films are made  possible  through  a
dynamic  collaboration  between   national   production   and   distribution
companies across the EU.  In the creation process,  each  local  distributor
assumes the risk of advancing money toward the budget of a film,  secure  in
the knowledge that they will each have the exclusive exploitation rights  in
all media in their respective  countries.  These  arrangements  ensure  that
distributors can afford to take the upstream  risk  of  participating  in  a
film’s financing.  In  reality,  the  territorial  apportionment  of  rights
actually stimulates the dissemination  of  the  film  amongst  audiences  in
several EU countries, rather than constituting a barrier to it.

   6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a  service  provider:]
      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the
      necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still
      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on
      the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer
      to a different website than the one he is trying to access)?

( YES

There are valid reasons for rightholders and  service  providers  to  impose
territorial restrictions on service recipients,  even  in  cases  where  the
service  provider  has  acquired  all  the  necessary  rights  for  all  the
territories in question.  Most importantly is to achieve the shared goal  of
wide and effective distribution.  The  producer  and  distributor  carefully
negotiate the grant of rights and authorized uses, including the  manner  in
which the consumer (service recipient) may access, store, or  view  content.
The authorized uses by consumers may be restricted for  content  protection.
Upholding the distributor’s exclusivity protects the investment  he  has  to
make, at a high risk, in order to bring the film to  the  attention  of  its
potential audience and distribute as widely as possible. It is an  essential
an incentive to maximize the film’s exposure and availability to  consumers.
 Coordination  of  exclusive  licenses  used  to  finance  production  is  a
standard operating procedure for the independent film industry and  protects
the investment in the production.  This  approach  ultimately  supports  the
quality and diversity  of  choice  available  to  consumers  by  aiding  the
economic sustainability of the sector,  from  distributors  to  broadcasters
and other platforms.

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?

( NO

No measures of a legislative or regulatory nature are necessary to  increase
the cross-border availability of content  services  in  the  Single  Market.
Market-led  developments  and  private   commercial   negotiations   between
producers and distributors will  adapt  if  and  when  a  critical  mass  of
consumer demand for cross-border access to content becomes evident.

The EU copyright framework does not prohibit multi-territory  licensing  and
as such, it is fit for purpose and not in need of review.  Actual  obstacles
to multi-territory licensing, other than the cultural and  economic  factors
discussed  above,  relate  to  the  transactional  costs  involved  in   the
requirement  that  the  service  providers  comply   with   multiple   local
regulatory requirements  such  as,  VAT,  content  regulation  and  consumer
protection.  Additionally,  some  Member  States  have  yet  to  develop   a
broadband  infrastructure  capable  of  supporting   effective   access   to
auiovisual media services by consumers. As  with  any  other  business,  the
expected revenue  must  justify  incurring  the  cost  of  multi-territorial
compliance – currently it does not.




Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?





[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]



The act of “making available”


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?

( YES

The scope of the “making available”  right  in  cross-border  situations  is
sufficiently clear.  The definition of “making available”  as  laid  out  in
the EU Copyright Directive[iii] (referred to as the  “Directive”  throughout
this submission) is in line with the language in the WIPO  Copyright  Treaty
(WCT)[iv] and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)[v]  which  gave
birth to the right-of-making-available in international law.  The  Directive
is sufficiently clear to  have  allowed  for  effective  implementation  and
interpretation of this right in EU Member States.  Recent CJEU case law  has
also clarified the application of  this  important  exclusive  right,  which
plays a pivotal role in content protection and exploitation, representing  a
key incentive for innovation and the growth in online  services  across  the
EU.

   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief)?

( YES

A clarification of the territorial scope of the “making available” right  is
not necessary for its implementation and use  in  the  practice  of  content
licensing in the EU market.




Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?

( NO

Producers  regularly  bundle  licensed  rights  to  permit  distribution  to
maximize exploitation of the rights so as to aggregate all  rights  relevant
to the unencumbered distribution and exploitation of the finished  work.  In
effect, current licensing  practice,  under  normal  circumstances,  ensures
that there is no separate ownership or control of the  two  rights  involved
in the act of “making available” to the public.



Linking and browsing


  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

( YES

Hyperlinks are an important component in accessing online content.  This  is
a  complex  area,  justifying  a  case-by-case  approach   and   progressive
clarification through jurisprudence. CJEU case law in this area  has  proven
helpful in answering questions arising in each specific case as  to  whether
or not linking or indexing and similar editorial options are  tantamount  to
an act of communication to the public.  Each specific situation  raises  the
issue of what the effect of the linking function may be in  enabling  access
to content and in the case  of  illegally  uploaded  content,  its  role  in
displacing licensed content. In view of the complexities, We  see  no  locus
for legislative intervention, as any codified rules will still  need  to  be
interpreted through the courts and new statutes would soon become  redundant
and out of date.


  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
      reproduction of  a  work  or  other  subject  matter  protected  under
      copyright on the  screen  and  in  the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s
      computer, either  in  general  or  under  specific  circumstances,  be
      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

( YES

Making available only allows reproduction and access and no copy  should  be
retained  by  a  consumer  without  authorization  by  the  rights   holder.
Jurisprudence has already helped to clarify the  issue.  The  exception  for
certain types of temporary copies as  defined  under  Article  5(1)  of  the
Directive makes good sense in  order  to  prevent  certain  basic  universal
features  of  the  online  space  falling  unnecessarily   under   copyright
protection.  The  exception  should  be  interpreted  restrictively  by  the
courts, however, so as to prevent operators of pirate sites from  sheltering
their infringing activities under this exception.  The determination of  the
source of the material being thus temporarily  reproduced  should  obviously
be a key determinant  in  establishing  whether  or  not  the  Article  5(1)
exception applies or whether the case constitutes an infringement.



Download to own digital content


  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

( NO

This question is misleading since it could imply that contracts  restricting
the  resale  of  digital  files  are  incompatible  with  EU  Law.  This  is
emphatically not the case. Article 3(3) of the Directive  provides  for  the
non-exhaustion of the rights of communication and making available. This  is
also fleshed out under Recital (29), which clarifies that “the  question  of
exhaustion does not arise in the case of services and  on-line  services  in
particular”. The Recital further states that “Unlike CD-ROM or  CD-I,  where
the intellectual property in incorporated in a material  medium,  namely  an
item of goods, every on-line service in in  fact  an  act  which  should  be
subject to authorisation where the copyright or related right so  provides.”


Current licensing practice based on contractual  freedom  enables  consumers
to choose  the  services  from  which  they  wish  to  purchase  audiovisual
content, in full cognizance of the terms of the transaction. These may,  for
instance, include the option to make several copies of  the  content  across
several devices, including portable ones.

  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.

The download to own business model is considered highly  strategic  for  the
future of the European content industry. Retention  of  a  digital  copy  of
content is one of the options consumers desire, and for the  producer,  this
option is can be an important additional source of revenue from the  digital
marketplace.

Under Article 3(3) of the Directive, intangible copies are  not  subject  to
EU-wide exhaustion and each use must therefore trigger the  exclusive  right
of the rightholder to  authorise  or  prohibit.  Emergent  download  to  own
models demonstrate the focus of  the  industry  on  meeting  the  consumer’s
legitimate demand for flexibility of use within those  parameters.  Some  of
these models authorise – on an individual license basis  –  multiple  copies
(e.g. Blu-ray/DVD triple-play) and access from/by different devices  within,
say, the family  circle.   Developments  in  the  private  sector  licensing
models will ensure that consumer demand is met in this respect, without  the
need for enabling legislation.  We believe that the  Directive  is  fit  for
purpose in its current form. Any attempt to weaken Article 3(3)  may  damage
a key economic incentive for the growth of new audiovisual  online  services
and platforms.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?

( NO

Voluntary registration of works aids the management of  content  online  and
the  protection  of  legitimate  licenses.   However,   there   is   not   a
justification for the creation of a registration system at the EU level.

The audiovisual sector has of  its  own  accord  made  substantial  progress
towards  a  workable  registration  systems  over  the   past   few   years.
International initiatives such as ISAN (International  Standard  Audiovisual
Number  –  an  ISO  standard)[vi]   and   EIDR   (Entertainment   Identifier
Registry)[vii] are complemented by local  initiatives,  the  Linked  Content
Coalition  (a  pan-European  initiative   originated   in   the   publishing
industry), and the UK’s Digital Content Exchange, which seeks to make small-
scale  licensing  more  effective  through  the  creation   of   a   central
information clearinghouse on works.

The effective identification and registration of works  lies  in  voluntary,
transparent and  open-ended  systems  fostered  by  the  relevant  copyright
sectors themselves working in a collaborative framework based on  trial  and
error.

  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

We  do  not  see  any  advantage  in  a  mandatory   and   centrally-managed
registration system at the EU level.

  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

A mandatory registration system at the EU level would be a barrier for  many
copyright owners who  rely  on  the  notion  that  copyright  protection  is
afforded to those that meet the minimum legal  requirements  of  originality
and  fixation,  not  to  those  that  “register”.    Disadvantages   include
erroneous and out of date entries, along with the risk that  such  a  system
would act as a substitute for legitimate methods  to  demonstrate  copyright
ownership.  There could also be  mass  confusion  as  to  what  registration
means and if there are any legal presumptions of ownership as  a  result  of
registration.

  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?

All such systems should  operate  on  a  strict  voluntary  basis,  with  no
penalisation of those rights  holders  who  choose  not  to  register  their
works. The only  incentives  should  arise  from  the  efficiency  of  these
initiatives and their ability to entice licensors to register works  on  the
basis that they would  see  this  as  an  expedient  and  efficient  way  of
complementing the management and exploitation of their back-catalogues.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?

The role of the EU should be  to  continue  to  facilitate  discussions  and
encourage marketplace solutions to interoperability of rights ownership  and
permissions databases, such as ISAN and EIDR.  We do not  believe  the  case
has been made for any further EU intervention in this space.




Term of protection – is it appropriate?


  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

( YES

The current terms of copyright protection are  appropriate  in  the  digital
environment.






 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

( NO

The current approach, as laid out in Article 5 of the Directive enables  the
right degree of  harmonisation  whilst  also  maintaining  necessary  Member
States’ sovereignty over aspects of their cultural,  educational  and  other
public policy areas. The approach has fostered sufficient legal  convergence
between Member States’ legal systems while retaining the flexibility  needed
to accommodate cultural, social  and  political  differences.  The  original
Article 5 is the product of years of in-depth debate between legislators  to
determine the right balance between direct harmonisation  and  subsidiarity.
It is clear that exceptions and limitations are not  an  area  of  copyright
law which lends itself to mandatory  harmonisation.  We  believe  Article  5
strikes the right balance and is fit for purpose for the digital age.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

( NO

As stated above,  flexibility  is  key  in  the  matter  of  exceptions  and
limitations to copyright protection. Various cultural and societal  contexts
at the national level militate  against  a  mandatory  approach  at  the  EU
level, over and above the degree of harmonisation already effected.


  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.

( NO

There is no self-evident case for new exceptions  being  introduced  at  EU-
level. Nor is there a case for removal  of  the  existing  list  as  set  in
Article 5 of the Directive.  The system  has  proven  its  adaptability  and
flexibility in the EU context of 28 Member States and  a  large  variety  of
approaches to public policy and societal priorities. Case law  at  the  CJEU
and national  level  has  helped  clarify  where  necessary  the  boundaries
between  these  exceptions/limitations  and  the  application  of  exclusive
rights.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

( NO

As stated above, the requisite flexibility – as intended  by  the  Directive
in its original form – already exists. This is demonstrated  by  the  robust
dynamism  or  areas  such  as  online  learning,  academia  and   scientific
research, buoyed in part by the  availability  of  relevant  exceptions  and
limitations. These developments  have  taken  place  in  parallel  with  the
growth of online services based on the application of exclusive rights.


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

N/A – See above reply

  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

( NO

The question seems to contain  an  underlying  bias,  i.e.,  the  idea  that
territoriality should no longer be a factor in the  application/exercise  of
a limitation or exception to exclusive rights. As stated  above,  Article  5
of  the  Directive  on  limitations  and  exceptions  to  copyright   leaves
considerable flexibility to Member States in recognition  of  the  need  for
subsidiarity in  this  area,  owing  to  inevitable  societal  and  cultural
differences  and  attendant  differences  in  how  the  public  interest  is
attended to in different national legislatures. This flexibility is  helped,
not hindered by the territoriality principle.


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

Articles 5(2)(b), 5(2)(c) and 5(2)(e) of the Directive establish  the  legal
principles governing fair  compensation  in  relation  to  the  exercise  of
exceptions and limitations in the  same  article.  Making  changes  to  this
legal structure would  entail  far-reaching  changes  to  the  EU  copyright
acquis. To our  knowledge,  there  is  no  impact  assessment  nor  evidence
supporting the need for cross-border exceptions and  limitations  or  change
to the financial compensation standards established at a national level.

      specific problems when trying to negotiate agreements  to  enable  the
      electronic lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books  or
      other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?
(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

N/A

  37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

N/A

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the
previous one (n° 2).
  38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences  do
      you  see  in  the  management  of  physical  and  online  collections,
      including providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you
      encountered?

N/A

  39. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  What difference do you see
      between  libraries’  traditional  activities   such   as   on-premises
      consultation or public lending and  activities  such  as  off-premises
      (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have
      you encountered?

N/A


Mass digitisation


  40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging  or  wanting
      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective
      management organisation:] Would it be necessary  in  your  country  to
      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed
      across the EU?

N/A

  41. Would it be necessary to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
      agreed for other types of content (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
      collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

N/A





Teaching


  42. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including
      across borders?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

N/A

  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

  44. What mechanisms exist in the market place to  facilitate  the  use  of
      content for illustration for teaching  purposes?  How  successful  are
      they?

Research


  47. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to use works
      or   other   subject   matter   in    the    context    of    research
      projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

Disabilities


  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you
      experienced problems with accessibility to content,  including  across
      borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?


(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?
(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?

We support the need to provide practical solutions to facilitate  access  to
audiovisual content by  users  with  disabilities.  Special  subtitling  and
audio description tools are  increasingly  made  available.   The  Directive
contains several provisions relevant  to  promoting  access  to  users  with
disabilities; for example, Article 5(3)(b) allows  for  different  kinds  of
uses and illustrates that the flexible approach taken by the  Directive  can
be  adapted  to  the  various  categories  of  copyright  works,  forms   of
distribution, and especially to the particular  needs  of  disabled  persons
and their individual disability. Any new separate mandatory  provision,  for
example  providing  for  an  obligation  to  make  available  content  in  a
particular format, would be  incompatible  with  technological  developments
over time. It would also be ill-adapted to meeting the  current  and  future
needs of individual disabled users.  In  general,  individual  and  flexible
contractual solutions are best suited to achieve  the  objective  of  better
accessibility of audiovisual content for users with disabilities.

  51. If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?

In general, individual and flexible contractual solutions  are  best  suited
to achieve the objective of better accessibility of audiovisual content  for
users with disabilities.

Text and data mining


  53. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional
      user:] Have you  experienced  obstacles,  linked  to  copyright,  when
      trying to use text or data mining methods, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or

User-generated content


  58. (a) [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you
      experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing  works  or  other
      subject matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
      across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?
(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?

( NO

No new exception is needed to cover user-generated  content,  in  particular
non-commercial activities by  individuals,  and  no  legislative  change  is
needed. Discussions within the “Licences for  Europe”  stakeholder  dialogue
confirmed that  user-generated  content  services  are  thriving  under  the
flexibility  offered  by  the  EU  copyright  acquis.  The  existing   legal
framework was  shown  to  provide  effective  solutions  for  the  user-case
scenarios that were  presented  to  the  Working  Group,  and  there  is  an
increasing number of licensing schemes and agreements.[viii]


  59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder:]
      Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you
      have  created  (on  the  basis  of  pre-existing  works)  is  properly
      identified for online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in  this
      context?
(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?

N/A

  60. (a) [In particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer  or  a  right

      for the use of the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing
      works)?
(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have

      conditions?

There is no need for further legislation in  this  area.  Copyright  is  the
driving force behind innovation and  the  EU  copyright  acquis  provides  a
sufficient degree of flexibility for  a  wide  range  of  technological  and
marketplace developments to meet consumer demands.

  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Copyright is the driving  force  behind  innovation  and  the  EU  copyright
acquis provides a sufficient degree of  flexibility  for  a  wide  range  of
technological and marketplace developments to meet consumer demands.



  IV. Private copying and reprography

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography exceptions  in  the
      digital environment?

( NO

Articles 5(2)(b), 5(5) and 6(4)  of  the  Directive  and  relevant  Recitals
already provide a solid interpretive framework for the application of  these
exceptions. Digital technologies increasingly support business  models  that
allow producers and distributors to make available  and  distribute  content
to consumers on  demand.  Therefore,  private  commercial  negotiations  and
licensing with distributors is the preferred  method  for  producers  to  be
compensated in the digital environment. We favour face to face  negotiations
in determining the compensation for use of their exclusive  rights.  Private
copying and compulsory licensing and compensation should be  a  last  resort
approach in ensuring the producers are fairly compensated for  all  uses  of
their content.


The exception in EU law permitting private copy should be  applied  only  in
specific cases where  there  is  no  practical  possibility  for  market-led
solutions  to  prevail.  The  2013  report  by  Antonio  Vittorino  on  this
particular issue illuminated the primacy of licensing based  on  contractual
freedom and the use of exclusive rights. The  Padawan  case[ix]  before  the
CJEU also provides clarification to the effect that  copies  made  available
through normal licensing do not give rise to levies.

  65. Should digital copies made by end users for private  purposes  in  the
      context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where
      the harm to the rightholder is minimal, be subject to private  copying
      levies?

( NO

It would be both contradictory and destructive to apply levies where  direct
licensing to individual consumers is fully possible. The sustainable  growth
of online audiovisual content services rests largely on the  possibility  to
offer the consumer a variety of pricing points and options through  licensed
uses, both enabled and protected by technology. These business  models  make
full use of the range of Digital Rights Management technologies to  offer  a
wide array of content on a secure basis and an increasing range  of  options
for the consumer, including streaming, download to own (for permanent  use),
download to  rent  (for  limited  use),  over-the-top  access  to  purchased
content via the  Internet/cloud-based  services  through  Internet-connected
devices, etc.  Inasmuch as the function of private copy is  to  empower  the
consumer to make a single copy  for  his/her  personal  use,  the  need  for
private copy levies  is  obviated  once  these  technology-enabled  business
models are able to offer flexible access  options  direct  to  the  consumer
through a great diversity of licensing architectures, including  options  to
make and use a copy of the work within contractually-defined boundaries.

Furthermore, income from levies does not provide producers with the  capital
to finance production in the same manner that license fees do, since  levies
are worked out on the basis which bears little or no direct relation to  the
real market value of  each  film  and  income  from  levies  are  often  not
received for several years  following  the  exploitation  of  the  content’s
primary license.

  66. How would changes in levies with respect to the application to  online
      services  (e.g.  services  based  on  cloud  computing  allowing,  for
      instance, users to  have  copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the
      development and functioning of new business models on the one hand and
      rightholders’ revenue on the other?

As discussed above, private copy dispositions and attendant levies  are  not
a necessity in the context of the  growth  of  online  services  which  will
enable individual access to a work through direct  licensing,  with  options
to view or copy the content within contractually defined parameters of  use.
This model allows for both an optimisation  of  consumer  choice/flexibility
of use and value-based pricing which help  make  the  services  economically
sustainable.
  67.  Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices
      for products subject to levies?

( NO

We do not see added value in making  levies  visible  on  the  invoices  for
products subject to levies. Such disposition may  create  confusion  in  the
individual consumer, who may erroneously conclude that  the  presence  of  a
levy would excuse  him/her  from  limiting  copying  to  its  defined  legal
boundaries.


  68. Have you experienced a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
      resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate  payments  of  the  same
      levy, or other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

N/A

  69. What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other
      than  natural  persons  for  purposes  clearly  unrelated  to  private
      copying? Do any of those transactions result in undue payments? Please
      explain in detail the example you provide (type of products,  type  of
      transaction, stakeholders, etc.).

N/A
  70. Where such undue payments arise, what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
      affect? To what extent  could  a  priori  exemptions  and/or  ex  post
      reimbursement schemes existing in some Member States  help  to  remedy
      the situation?

  71. If you have identified specific problems with the current  functioning
      of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

  72. [In particular if you are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

Film and audiovisual content industries in the EU Member  States  have  well
developed and efficient mechanisms already  in  place  to  ensure  the  fair
remuneration of talent participating in the making of an  audiovisual  work.
Whether based on the application of neighbouring  rights  and/or  agreements
based on collective bargaining, these systems generally ensure that  authors
and performers will a) receive upfront payment for their work  on  the  film
(e.g. salaries and/or advance on further payments) and  b)  receive  further
payments based on the economic exploitation  of  the  finished  work.  These
may, for instance, be  in  the  form  of  residual  payments  (e.g.  a  pre-
established rate based on initial salary for each sale to each media  and/or
territory), and/or royalties (e.g. payment calculated  as  a  percentage  of
net revenues after distribution  costs  and  commissions),  etc.  Note  that
whilst  these  creative  contributors  are  invariably  always   remunerated
upfront, this is not generally the case with the producer, who invests  time
and economic resources upfront and at risk,  in  the  hope  of  remunerating
him/herself from revenue streams.

In  the  audiovisual  sector,  under  normal  circumstances,  the   producer
centralises all the rights which come in to  the  making  of  a  work.  This
organisational model is  not  the  product  of  ideology,  but  a  pragmatic
adjustment to the nature of  film  as  containing  a  great  many  different
rights, from music synchronisation to performance rights and from rights  in
underlying works (e.g.  a  theatrical  play,  a  novel),  to  trademarks  in
objects captured in the film. The aggregation of these IP rights  under  the
control of the producer (or her successor in the  chain  of  title)  enables
efficient  and  expedient  transactions  with  distributors,   broadcasters,
online services and other  outlets.  The  future  competitiveness  of  works
produced in the EU would be negatively affected by  any  attempt  to  tamper
with these fine-tuned industrial practices by  dis-aggregating  the  control
and management of the IP components in a film. In  particular,  imposing  an
obligation on distributors to administer online  rights  (making  available)
separately  from  other  bundles  of  rights,  would  necessarily   add   to
transaction costs in distribution, without increasing  the  benefit  already
accruing to authors and performers.  The risk also exists that  –under  this
model – authors and performers would be paid twice for  the  same  uses,  an
effect which would be neither fair nor effective.

We are concerned that this question, as framed, fails to encompass the  more
strategic issue of the overall relationship between rights and  revenues  in
the audiovisual content sector. Whereas the issue  of  the  remuneration  of
authors and performers is undoubtedly  important,  they  are  not  the  only
contributors to a finished film.  Numerous talented and skilled  individuals
intervene in the  making  of  a  film.   Considerable  resources  are  spent
upstream of production, in the process of  creative  development,  budgeting
and production planning.  Most of these activities  are  undertaken  by  the
producer and his/her collaborators and are not  remunerated.   In  order  to
take into account those costs, what the audiovisual sector requires  is  not
a technical/administrative model for returning  revenues  to  specific  sub-
groups of contributors, but a larger model for return on  investment.   This
model  needs  to  take  into  account  the  high  costs  of  producing   any
audiovisual work to a  professional  standard  and  the  attendant  need  to
maintain an economic  system  that  returns  sufficient  revenue  to  enable
Europe’s production SMEs  to  channel  new  resources  into  the  industry’s
creative R&D.

For robust return on investment to develop, one  key  strategic  requirement
in the future will be to create an economic environment for online  services
to evolve from being a modest source of ancillary revenue, to being able  to
assume risk and contribute upfront to the costs of developing and  producing
new content. The imposition of  more  complex,  fragmented  and  (therefore)
costly  arrangements  governing  the  redistribution  of  revenue  from  the
exploitation of content on these platforms will only hinder  this  necessary
evolution.  The net result would be a loss of competitiveness  for  all  but
the more high-profile EU content.

  73. Is there a need to act at the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
      certain clauses in contracts)?

( NO

There is no need  for  EU  level  action  to  prohibit  certain  clauses  in
contracts.  Existing arrangements (collective and/or contractual)  governing
terms of employment and remuneration of  creative  contributors  in  the  EU
audiovisual industries are the product of  long-term  trial-and-error;  they
evolved from the  ongoing  dialogue  and  negotiation  between  the  various
parties  concerned.  Legislative  intervention  would  be   disruptive   and
inefficient:  there   are   no   one-size-fits-all   formulae   and   whilst
arrangements vary between Member States, these variations have not  hindered
cross-border joint ventures, as evidence by the large  number  of  EU  films
and television series co-produced between two or more Member States.

It is difficult to see what competitive  benefit  could  conceivably  accrue
from the imposition  of  a  right  to  remuneration  and  the  extension  of
collective management to online on-demand uses, when this type  of  use  can
be managed far less onerously through  existing  industry  practice  and  in
full compliance with contractual  arrangements  (underpinned  by  collective
bargaining and/or  regulation)  governing  redistribution  to  all  relevant
creative contributors.

  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

N/A


  VI. Respect for rights

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

( NO

The EU Enforcement Directive[x] is fit for  purpose  in  its  current  form,
bearing in  mind  the  particular  limitations  of  what  civil  enforcement
measures can help bring into effect as  part  of  legal  deployment  against
infringement. Infringements committed  with  a  commercial  purpose  require
criminal remedies and ex  officio  enforcement  by  government  authorities.
Civil remedies in the form of individual lawsuits  are  expensive,  scarcely
affordable by most  independent  producers,  and  judgements  (if  any)  are
difficult to enforce effectively; and most  importantly,  civil  enforcement
shifts the burden of enforcement away from the criminal public  domain  into
the private sphere where most independents cannot adequately  protect  their
rights.

  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

Yes, the current legal framework is clear enough  to  allow  for  sufficient
involvement of intermediaries in inhibiting online  copyright  infringements
with a commercial purpose. The involvement of intermediaries  is  a  pivotal
development in the advancement of lawful dissemination of content  over  the
Internet. Article 8(3) of  the  Directive  has  proven  its  usefulness  and
efficiency as a pragmatic measure designed  to  ensure  that  intermediaries
play their full-part in anti-infringement without having to be  held  liable
for the particular infringement.

Regrettably this  important  disposition  of  the  directive  has  not  been
correctly implemented in some Member  States,  with  the  result  that  some
jurisdictions  still  require  that  intermediaries  be  proven  liable  for
infringement  before  injunctive  relief  is  granted.   This   creates   an
unnecessary hurdle and defeats the intended efficiency of Article 8(3).

  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

( YES

The right to property is amongst the fundamental rights  which  need  to  be
taken into account  in  assessing  whether  or  not  the  right  balance  is
achieved.  The CJEU has made clear  that  in  ruling  on  this  issue  (e.g.
Constantin Vega vs Kino[xi]), courts in the  Member  States  shall  use  the
proportionality test, taking into account the rights of all concerned.



 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

( NO

The EU should not pursue the establishment of a single  EU  Copyright  Title
at this time.  It is not clear that any such unified approach would  produce
the desired outcome as a means of establishing a  consistent  framework  for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU or a single  framework  for
enforcement.

  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

No.   EU  and  international  law  provide  Member  States  with  sufficient
flexibility which is particularly important in view of the  different  legal
systems and traditions of the 28 Member States.   Such  an  endeavour  would
likely take several years, if not decades to achieve, if at all possible.



VIII. Other issues

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

With respect to this Public Consultation and any other  matters  related  to
the EU legal framework for copyright, we strongly  urge  the  Commission  to
carefully review and consider all of the evidence submitted by  stakeholders
and to exercise caution before seeking legislative answers  to  markets  and
technologies that are in the midst of rapid change.
