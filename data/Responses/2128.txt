 I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?

B.    [The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Access to published knowledge for education and research is protected on the basis of a
bundle of national rights in each Member State. Despite of the harmonization attempts by the
existing EU Directives, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited
to the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense
that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. articles in journals,
books – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for each national territory in which
the content is communicated to the public.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to users of science information wanting to
access services that are made available in Member States other than the one in which they
live. Not all online services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems
when trying to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same”
service is available in all Member States, users cannot access the service across borders (they
can only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES



                                                                                               2
2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
  YES

3.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
[Open question]

4.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples


  NO OPINION


5.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
        – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
  NO OPINION


6.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
  YES – Please explain
Yes.

A reform of the copyright rules is needed to adapt to the digital world we live in. The rules must be
harmonised to create an EU digital single market without borders and give EU citizens the same


                                                                                                   3
access to content and services. This means that innovative services should be able to flourish and EU
citizens should be able to enjoy those services across the EU. It is simply unacceptable that getting a
digital single market is so complicated due to digital borders that should not exist on the Internet and
that users and service providers are constantly wondering if what they do is legal or not.

        – Please explain

C.    Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
    1. [The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC1 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software2 and databases3.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders4 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

    2. The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public 5. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act


1
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
2
  Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.
3
  Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
4
  Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
5
  See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights,
and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-

                                                                                                                          4
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of users residing in a specific country
when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or
a currency specifically targeted at that group.

7.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


   NO – Please explain how this could be clarified and what type of clarification would be
required (e.g. as in "targeting" approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach 6)
No, it is not.

The ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the
information society’7, prepared by a Belgian law firm De Wolf & Partners at the request of the

European Commission, identifies in its section on the ‘Study on the territoriality of the making
available right - Localisation of the act of making available to the public and its consequences’ that
there are quite a few bottlenecks and uncertainties.

The Study notably points out that:8

“The absence of a definition of the making available right creates some legal uncertainty as to the
territorial reach of the online accessibility of protected subject matter. Different elements of this
complex act could be considered relevant to establish the application of the national right of making
available to the public: the availability on a server or the transmission to a Member State, even
accessibility of the work has not explicitly been ruled out as a relevant element for the making
available right. Consequently if all Member States are free to determine which element of the
complex act is relevant to establish an act of making available, then each could subject this
constitutive part to the prior authorisation of the author (and to the corresponding payment of a
licence fee). The Member States could define the same or different criteria to apply their national
making available right. At least in theory, this would lead to the accumulation of distinct acts of
making available under the national copyright legislations concerned that do not necessarily

144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,
Case C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
6
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that must be
licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member State in which the
content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many Member States the work can
be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with regard to broadcasting by satellite
(see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright
applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).

correspond to the same technical and/or economic criteria. Without a clarification of this restricted
act, its relation to the other exclusive economic rights and the localisation criterion, it remains
speculative which facts will trigger an infringement and in which Member State.”

As a result, it concludes that, on the one hand “the exact scope of the making available right (...) is
not clear” and on the other, “the territorial reach of the making available right is uncertain”.9

Looking at the specific case of cultural heritage institutions, we see that they are increasingly asked
to provide access to cultural heritage across the entire EU. In the majority of cases works made
available on the websites of cultural heritage institutions are made available without territorial
restrictions. In this situation there is substantial uncertainty about the scope of the ‘making available’
right when making works available to audiences in all of Europe.

Given that cultural heritage institutions have limited resources to spend on rights clearance the only
acceptable way to provide more clarity with regards to the scope of the ‘making available’ right
would be to apply a country of origin principle,10 making sure that the scope of this principle is clearly

defined and does not generate new bottlenecks.

ENCES considers that an approach based on targeted audiences would create increased burdens
since dissemination through platforms like Europeana is explicitly targeted at users in all Member
States.11 Applying a target country approach would make it more difficult for cultural heritage

institutions to make their works available via internationals projects like Europeana.

The same is true more broadly for all service providers and institutions to support education and
research making content available.




8.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief12)?

   This thus covers the scenario set out by Triaille, J-P., et. al. (2013). Ibid. p. 166, where: “in cases where it would be

available would be considered to occur in all the countries where the work is accessible.’

       3. Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

9.      [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?

problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")

       4. Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU 13 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU 14 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

10.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?

   NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why (e.g. because it does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by a copyright exception)
No.

The provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter protected by copyright should
under no circumstances be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

Hyperlinking is one of the most fundamental and basic activities of Internet use.

From a user perspective, most Internet users hyperlink on a daily basis: they post or share on social
networks such as Tumblr, Twitter or Facebook, write blog posts, make comments, recommendations,
etc. Hyperlinks are their modern referencing tool – they communicate the existence of content but
not the content itself – and an integral part of their interactions with other users.

From an innovation perspective, users’ ability to freely link to information and to share the ‘online
address’ of that information has led to an unprecedented amount of online innovation driving
economic growth. As a general rule, people should continue to be able to reference and refer to all
publicly available materials via a hyperlink. Referring to a copyright-protected work without
authorisation has always been and should remain legal.

From a technical perspective, hyperlinking is part of the Internet’s conception of a network in which
hyperlinks need to be understood as paths leading users from one source of information to the
other. Hyperlinks are, in the words of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,
nothing more than a reference or footnote and referring to publicly accessible information is a
fundamental right of free speech.15 In other words, hyperlinking must be understood in the context

of Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s underlying concept of the World Wide Web, namely “that any person could
share information with anyone else, anywhere”.16 Making hyperlinks fall under copyright protection

would hence break the Internet as we know it. If rightholders want to exert greater control over the
availability of their works online, they have various means to do so including the use of ‘paywalls’,
the Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt), etc..

From a legal point of view, hyperlinking is not covered by copyright protection because it is outside
the scope of the right of communication enshrined in Article 3 of the InfoSoc Directive.

The European Copyright Society, comprised of independent copyright academics, issued an opinion 17

on the Svensson case, in which it identifies three main reasons for this conclusion, summarised as
follows in the ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the
information society’, prepared by a Belgian law firm De Wolf & Partners at the request of the
European Commission:18

“Firstly, it was contended that the right of communication to the public requires a transmission that is
absent when merely a hyperlink is provided. It is merely a location tool, but exists independently from
the actual availability of the work. Secondly, the communication should address a public or a “new”
public. The hyperlink does not extend the public of the work, published online: those who had access
to the web page will still have access, those who did not have access (e.g. absent the payment of a
fee) will not gain access through the hyperlink.”

The European Copyright Society also argued that even if a transmission was to be held not necessary
for there to be ‘communication’, copyright law only catches communication of a ‘work’. A hyperlink
is clearly not a ‘work’ and as explained above, it is a location tool helping and allowing the user to
find where a work is. In fact, a hyperlink cannot be equated with a work because works can be
removed from the Internet at any time while hyperlinks remain intact.

The German Supreme Court came to the same conclusion in the Paperboy19 case stating that a search

engine setting a hyperlink to a website with copyright-protected content which has already been
made available to the public by the rightholder does not infringe copyright law. The Court made clear
that hyperlinks only refer to works facilitating access to them which has already been provided
making them “no different to a reference to a print or to a website in the footnote of a publication”.20

With regard to Article 3 of the InfoSoc Directive the Court unmistakably concluded that the “setting
of hyperlinks is not a communication in this sense”.21

The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) did not, however, render such a clear-cut decision: though it did
rule22 that the InfoSoc Directive must be interpreted to mean that the provision of a hyperlink
leading users to works that are freely available on the Internet is not subject to copyright protection,
it’s reasoning triggers more question marks for the future. Indeed, the CJEU does not consider that
hyperlinks are beyond the scope of copyright protection, as the German Supreme Court did in the
Paperboy case. The CJEU on the contrary considers that a hyperlink falls within that scope as it
defines it as an ‘act of communication of a work’. The only remaining question to assess the need to
request permission or the legality of the link is then the fact that this communication is done to a
‘new’ public or not. 23 Though the impact of this new line of reasoning is difficult to assess, ENCES can
only guess that this could lead to renewed uncertainty relating to one of the most basic acts on the
Internet, and a foundation of its underlying architecture, namely hyperlinking.

In conclusion, ENCES strongly believes that providing a hyperlink leading users to already publicly
available material should not require any authorisation. Hyperlinking is a modern referencing tool
communicating the online addresses of works, not the works themselves.

As pointed out by Christina Angelopoulos from the Institute for Information Law (IViR), asking this
question amounts to asking ‘whether the Internet is Legal’.24 This question actually shows the risks of

extensive interpretations and excessive legal claims.

Users’ everyday uses of digital technology create multiple temporary digital copies of content which
are essential to accessing and sharing content on the Internet. When a user views a web-page on his
computer, this triggers the making of a temporary copy on the screen as well as in the cache on the
hard disk. These copies are in inherent feature of today’s browsing technology enabling people to
actually read content on the screen of their e-reader, computer, tablet, smartphone, etc..

Requiring the authorisation of the rightholder for viewing and reading content that is already
available amounts to an additional permission which could lead to citizens infringing the law by
merely surfing on the Internet. This is clearly not socially tolerable and would further reduce the
acceptability of copyright law by citizens.

Moreover, this directly touches on users’ fundamental rights to receive and impart information.
Critically, this is about citizens’ right to read and, as pointed out by the UK Supreme Court in a
judgment dated 17 April 2013:25

“it has never been an infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an
infringing article in physical form. This state of affairs, which is recognised in the enumeration of the
copyright owner's rights in articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Directive, has never been thought inconsistent
with a high level of protection for intellectual property. All that article 5.1 of the Directive achieves is
to treat the viewing of copyright material on the internet in the same way as its viewing in physical
form, notwithstanding that the technical processes involved incidentally include the making of
temporary copies within the electronic equipment employed.”

In the same judgment, the UK Supreme Court points out that: 26

“Once it is accepted that part of the purpose of article 5.1 is to authorise the making of copies to
enable the end-user to view copyright material on the internet, the various conditions laid down by
that article must be construed so far as possible in a manner consistent with that purpose. It must, if
the exception is to be coherent, apply to the ordinary technical processes associated with internet
browsing.”

interpreted in a coherent manner and that any revision of the copyright framework strengthens it
further. We refer you also to our answers to Q28 to Q41 (related to archiving), Q53 to Q57 (on text
and data mining) and Q64 to Q71 (related to private copying).




       5. Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article) 27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy) 28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
Yes.

Though ENCES as an organisation does not encounter such restriction, we do in our personal capacity
know the frustrations stemming from the so called technical protection measures (TPMs) tools that
stop you from using a file from one device to another or to copy it.

Common restrictions on digital files purchased by users comprise restrictions of back-up copies,
restrictions as regards the conversion to other formats, limitations of compatibility to only certain
devices, technical impossibility to remix, etc..

27
   See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
28
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence
that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive
right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download with
the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

                                                                                                                            12

consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased

[Open question]

D.         Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered 30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
Yes.

It is currently sometimes difficult to know which works are protected by copyright and who you
should ask for permission when you want to use them. A registration system at EU level would make
this easier and create more legal certainty.

Such a registration system should also contain information on works that are in the Public Domain
and on works that have been made available under open content licenses such as the Creative
Commons Licenses. As a matter of fact the continued growth of Creative Commons illustrates that
registration-like systems work and provide substantial benefits to the public.




16.   What would be the possible advantages of such a system?
[Open question]


29
   For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the formalities as
opposed to works originating in another country.
30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012
on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.

                                                                                                                        13
The creation of a registration system at the EU level would be beneficial to both authors and users of
works. It would also be in line with the overall objectives of EU copyright policy as stated in this
consultation document, namely to ‘support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the
Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity’.

The advantages of a registration system have notably been listed by WIPO31 and go beyond

facilitating licensing:

● Access to rights information: A registration system would give everyone a clear and equal access
     to rights information. It could also integrate a variety of rights information, e.g. by indicating open
     licensing for authors that wish to distribute broadly under liberal terms.

● Legal certainty: It would increase the certainty of who is the rightholder to a work and provide a
     stable catalogue of information so that rightholders can be easily ascertained. This would help
     mitigate the problem of orphan works for future works, as there will be a formal registry of
     rightholders. It would also help in defining which works are in the public domain and hence do not
     require any authorisation from the rightholder. It would finally prevent unnecessary and
     unwanted protection of works of authorship, by notably avoiding that works are awarded
     copyright protection even though their authors do not require or desire this protection.

● More efficient and less costly licensing: A registration system could provide a more efficient
     mechanism for commercial licensing opportunities. Moreover, in general, a registration system
     will help reduce the transaction costs between rightholders and potential users.

Other benefits: If the registration system were developed using open standards and formats, it would
provide a rich set of rights information as open data to be used in third party applications and
services. This could for example enable tools that give a more accurate overview of creativity and
culture in the EU.

Registration systems can lead to having embedded information to permit quicker and instantaneous
payment. If this is the case, this should in no case be used to restrict the freedoms of end-users.

If a registration system is created, rightholders should be required to register their works in order to
be granted particular protections, such as the ability to start an enforcement action (see our answer
to Q18 for more details and other possible incentives).

17.       What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?

[Open question]
Registration systems carry the risk that they are used to undermine existing rights and flexibilities,
amongst others by being associated to an obligations to filter and block content. This is not a result
that ENCES would find acceptable and safeguards must be put in place to avoid such risks.

18.   What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?
[Open question]

E.       How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed 32, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database 33 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition34 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub 35 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
The European Union’s role in the adoption of identifiers in the content sector should be two-fold:

1) The EU should ensure that identifiers as well as rights ownership and permission databases are
     based on open standards, available to all content creators and able to be read by all market
     participants free of charge, as well as ensuring they are publicly accessible via machine readable
     interfaces; and




32
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International Standard Book
Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

2) The EU should ensure that all identifiers as well as rights ownership and permission databases are
      interoperable across all of Europe (and beyond).

From a methodological/procedural point of view, any system that is put in place must be developed
in a true multi-stakeholder approach (e.g. not only by rights holders and intermediaries) and should
reflect work already undertaken (for example by Europeana). Rights ownership and permission
databases must also include the ability to store information on out-of-copyright (public domain) and
openly licensed works.

The scope of permission databases also needs to be carefully considered, to avoid rightholders
setting unilaterally permissions including for acts which are not subject to copyright, and an
overbroad expansion of identifiers for example in all types of content, including user-generated
content (UGC). The latter is both unrealistic, burdensome considering the volumes of UGC generated
on an hourly basis on the Internet and creates issues in terms of user privacy and anonymity.

The European Commission’s approach on this subject seems fundamentally flawed to us. Indeed the
Commission has opted to support the vastly and unnecessarily complicated and expensive ‘linked
content coalition’ of exceptionally well-funded organisations to assert their rights on content. It
seems to ENCES that a much fairer, simpler, more efficient and more effective approach would be to
promote the standardised inclusion of information such as payment details in digital content, to
enable commercial users to easily obtain all relevant information when they need it.


F.          Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention36 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain if they should be longer or shorter
No.

The ‘logic’ of copyright rests on the fact that a monopoly right is granted for a limited time in order to
encourage and reward creativity. This monopoly restricts competition and imposes restrictions on
the access and use by consumers of the copyrighted works.

In the EU, copyrighted material remains protected up to 70 years after the death of the author when
it concerns artistic works, and up to 70 years after the death of the last surviving major contributor
(e.g. director, composer, screenwriter), when it concerns films and audio-visual content.

These current terms of copyright protection (including neighbouring rights protection) are excessive
and do not reflect sound economic and legal considerations of the actual duration required for
creators to recoup their investment in their works and their creativity rather than transforming
copyright into a rent-seeking tool. . Indeed, the term of protection of life plus 70 years stands in stark
contrast with the comparatively short commercial life of the large majority of in-copyright works.37

From a user/creator perspective, public domain works are a key foundation on which both old and
new forms of expression (such as remix) can flourish thanks to the lack of copyright restrictions. The
longer copyright term, the less public domain works are available for distribution, use and re-use.

Moreover, the term is not always counted from the moment of the author's death and it is not
always clear whether the person indicated as the author is the only creative contributor to the work.

From the specific perspective of cultural heritage institutions, these institutions hold large collections
of works that are still under copyright (or where the copyright status is unclear) but that are not
exploited commercially anymore.

There are barriers to the incentive to digitise and make available online the large collections of works
that are no longer commercially exploited but are or may still be protected by copyright. The
rightholders lack the economic incentive to recover the costs of digitising an out of commerce work
whilst the cultural heritage institution, incentivised by their own public mission, are confronted with
the additional cost of rights clearance without the promise of economic return. As a result the length

of copyright protection prevents cultural heritage institutions digitising and making available in-
copyright works. This in turn means they cannot effectively fulfil their public mission.

The term of copyright protection must be reduced to enhance access to knowledge and culture much
more quickly. 1538 to 25 years seems a more proportionate duration, or even 50 years, which is the

minimum requirement established by the Berne Convention (life of the creator plus 50 years). Similar
limitation of term should be processed with regard to neighbouring rights and in the field of
databases, where there is a clear risk of the latter remaining indefinitely under copyright protection if
their creator ‘updates’ them every 20 years to start a new term.

Shortening the term of protection will decrease the number of works that are in copyright but out of
commercial exploitation and will thus reduce the scope of the problems outlined above.

Moreover, society needs not only shorter copyright term but also a mechanism enabling faster
transfer to the public domain of works whose right owners abandon them (as in the case of some
orphan works) or do not use them commercially (out of commerce works).

At the same time, the EU should take action within WIPO in order to revise the Berne standard in
order to shorten it.




     II. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC39.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law40. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 41, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional42, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework
for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")43.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes.




41
   Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
42
   With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii) Article
5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
43
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                                               19
The optional nature of the list of exceptions and limitations has resulted in a patchwork of
approaches across the EU, creating confusion and legal uncertainty for users and an uneven playing
field for organisations.

European citizens should have the same rights as regards access to knowledge and culture regardless
of where they live, and should feel more secure about what their rights are in this area. This is
especially true when looking at all exceptions that affect users’ fundamental rights.

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
Yes.

As set out in our answer to Q21, the optional nature of the list of exceptions and limitations has
resulted in a patchwork of approaches across the EU, creating confusion and legal uncertainty for
users and an uneven playing field for organisations. This issue becomes more pressing as more and
more activities are taking place online.44

A reform of copyright rules is hence needed to ensure that all exceptions be made mandatory for all
Member States, and specified as not exhaustive. This list should cover at least the existing list of
exceptions, as well as the various additional exceptions such as those for e-lending, text and data
mining (TDM), etc. and should be required to be transposed literally into national law by each
Member State to ensure that the flexibility included in the current list of exceptions does not get
cancelled by an improper transposition. All the exceptions provided by the EU copyright Directives
are drafted on the basis that they do not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work and,
therefore, do not unreasonably prejudice rightholders. This means that making them mandatory in
all Member States should have no negative effect on rightholders, while in many cases this will
substantially benefit citizens and other public policy objectives such as access to knowledge and
culture or inclusive education.

It should also be stated that the listed exceptions must be interpreted as applying to ‘similar uses’
and a more general open flexible norm should be included. It should also be made clearer that
exceptions apply regardless of the type of work (neighbouring right) and regardless of the technical
nature of use (whether the work is fixed on a tangible medium or not). Finally, it is crucial that the
copyright framework confirms that exceptions cannot be contractually limited and that users are
authorised to remove technical restriction measures that prevent them from exercising their rights
stemming from an exception.

However, such a reform will take time and immediate action is required now. Therefore, the
European Commission should already state in in the documents it plans to release before summer
2014 that Member States should make maximum use of the existing flexibilities in the current
copyright Directives to ensure their copyright laws are fit-for-purpose in the digital age.

23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
[Open question]
Removing exceptions is unacceptable. On the contrary, a more flexible approach is needed,
combining the current system of a list of exceptions (but made mandatory for all EU countries and
specified as not exhaustive), but stating specifically that these cases must be interpreted as applying
to ‘similar uses’ and add a more general open norm that can adapt as technology changes (see our
answer to Q24).

Moreover, specific exceptions should be added to create immediate clarity rather than rely on the
use of an open norm or ‘similar uses’ principles:

● For text and data mining (TDM): It should be clarified that TDM does not fall under copyright
   provisions. On top of this, a specific exception allowing the copying of content for the purpose of
   text and data mining is necessary. It should also be explicitly stated in the law that technical
   protection measures (TPMs) and contracts should not override such an exception, nor any other
   exception. Finally, such an exception should not distinguish between commercial and non-
   commercial purposes as, for research institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer and
   such a differentiation would not be in the public interest.

                                                                                                    21
With regards to the cultural heritage institutions the status of e-lending should be clarified (see the
answers to Q36 and Q37) possibly via a new exception. In addition there cultural heritage institutions
need to be enabled to make works in their collections available online for non-commercial purposes.
As outlined in the answer to question 34 this does not require a new exception or limitation but can
be achieved by expanding the scope of the existing provision in Article 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc
Directive.

Finally there is a need to introduce an open ended norm (see our answer to Q24).

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
Yes.

The current EU copyright regime offers some form of flexibility, but in practice everything tends to
fall under copyright unless it is covered by an exception or limitation.

The exceptions and limitations in the InfoSoc Directive were drafted in a non-technologically neutral
manner, and well before YouTube and Facebook were created, or before anyone could foresee the
impact of sophisticated search techniques for research. As a result, everyday habits of online users
could be considered copyright infringements.

From a methodological perspective, it seems glaringly obvious that, by definition, exception and
limitations that apply to specific uses cannot ensure that as of yet unknown forms of use are covered
by them. Technological innovation can be expected to lead to new forms of use in the near future
and Europe would be well advised to create a copyright framework that is flexible enough to deal
with such developments and foster innovation rather than hold it back.

Europe would benefit from a more flexible, open norm approach that allows the legislative
framework to adapt to technological evolutions and innovations, and avoids situations where users
are criminalised for their behaviour or new technological uses are stifled in their development due to
legal uncertainty. The current discussion about text and data mining is a good example of this.
European researchers have to deal with legal uncertainties about the status of text and data mining
activities because the InfoSoc Directive fails to address this form of use that was (relatively) unknown
when the Directive was adopted.

An open norm would provide mechanism provide more certainty on the legal aspects of activities like
text and data mining without having to undertake legislative changes (which take years to
implement).

                                                                                                     22
A greater degree of flexibility is also desirable from the perspective of cultural heritage institutions as
it should allow them to react to new ways of making their collections available without the need for
legislative reform. Compared to institutions in countries that have a more flexible approach to
exceptions and limitations European institutions face a competitive disadvantage. Compare for
example the scope of the Google books project in the US and in Europe: In Europe Google and the
libraries are only digitising out-of-copyright works, while in the US the project also includes in
copyright titles. As a result citizens of the US have better access to their recent (20th century) culture

than European citizens.

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.
[Open question]
The EU should combine its current system of a precise list of limitations and exceptions (made
mandatory for all EU countries), state that the list is non-exhaustive and that is should be interpreted
as applying to ‘similar uses’ and add a more general open and flexible norm as set out in our answer
to Q24.

The main disadvantage of an open norm is that it relies on court decisions to get defined and can
thus reduce legal security the first years of their introduction. However, this legal uncertainty threat
flagged by some stakeholders is vastly exaggerated if one takes the approach of combining an open
norm with a robust list of exceptions and limitations.

Moreover, ENCES considers that this disadvantage is vastly outweighed by the benefits of introducing
additional flexibility, namely:

● Open norms allow justice to be applied in a fairer manner in concrete cases.




                                                                                                        23
● The US example has shown that an open norm becomes more predictable as to its interpretation
     as more courts issue their views on it and studies have demonstrated that the US fair use doctrine
     has delivered flexibility and room for innovation with relatively low rates of litigation45.


● Flexible norms avoid having to adapt the list of limitations and exceptions every X years, and will
     encourage ‘tomorrow’s inventions’, creative re-use and the development of new business models.

● The current copyright regime has not exactly induced crystal clear rules, as evidenced by the
     number of CJEU referrals by national courts, and by the application of the three-step test to the
     implementation of the InfoSoc Directive.

26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?
     YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to
Yes.

At present, even though the EU has identified a list of exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive, each
Member State can choose which of these exceptions are put into national law. As a result, a legal
practice in one Member State could be deemed a copyright infringement elsewhere.

From a research perspective, while the EU claims there is European Research Area (ERA), in reality a
true internal market for research depends on a joined-up copyright regime wherein researchers all
have genuine access to the knowledge they need. Currently, for example, inter-library loans are
hampered across borders. A joined-up, harmonised loan and preservation system across Europe will
not only considerably increase efficiency, but also enhance the ERA.

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
[Open question]
Creators are entitled to receive fair compensation for the use of their works although in science,
financial compensation is not the primary goal or motivation for publishing.

There is however no evidence that every use of work without compensation constitutes harm to the
author while there exists evidence that certain uses positively affect revenue from other uses. in case
of full harmonisation of exceptions, there should not be a problem with fair compensation. Generally
speaking, the whole concept of fair compensation should be revisited, in particular with respect to
science and education. Member States should be explicitly obliged to introduce compensation
schemes only if there is evidence of specific harm to authors that cannot be remedied in other way.


A.        Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts
of preservation and archiving 46 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions47. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive 48.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

    1. Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.

28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?

                                                                                                    25
   YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.
Yes.

Whilst the use of the preservation exception is reasonably unproblematic in an ‘analogue’ context, it
becomes an issue when applied in a digital context.

As a preliminary remark, we would like to point out that, whilst the consultation document limits
itself to activities of libraries and archives the questions in this section are equally relevant for
museums and other cultural heritage institutions.

In fact the relevant exceptions and limitations explicitly apply to “publicly accessible libraries,
educational establishments or museums, or (…) archives”. The Orphan Works Directive clarifies this to
include “film or audio heritage institutions and public-service broadcasting organisations”. In line
with this, the answers to Q28-35 and Q39-41 should be read as applying to all cultural heritage
institutions falling within this scope and not only to libraries and archives.

The main problem with the existing exception is that it does not cover all situations in which cultural
heritage institutions (libraries and archives but also museums) need to make reproductions as part of
their public mission to preserve and make available the works in their collections. On top of that, the
existing exception is not implemented in the same way across the EU. As a result, most EU countries
do not allow the making of copies for crucial activities like format shifting and structural digitisation
of collections or putting all kinds of artificial constraints to digitalisation. This, and the fact that they
cannot make digitised works available on-line without a license (see question 32 as well), severely
limits institutions in how they can leverage digital technologies.

As a result of the difference in implementation of the relevant exception across the Member States,
it is difficult to identify specific problems that occur on a European level. However it is essential for
cultural heritage institutions that they can digitise their collections in order to continue to preserve
them and to keep them available. Institutions increasingly digitise works in their collections not only
to prevent harm to the work, but to be able to better fulfil their missions. Digital copies of cultural
heritage works provide many advantages such as being (automatically) indexable, being easier to
access and having lower storage costs. The current national implementations of the exception
contained in Article 5(2)(n) of the InfoSoc Directive do not allow cultural heritage institutions to
structurally create digital copies of works in their collection. This is highly detrimental in an




                                                                                                          26
environment where, as the 'New Renaissance' Report on bringing Europe’s cultural heritage online
puts it, “digitisation is more than a technical option, it is a moral obligation”.49

In addition Recital 40 of the InfoSoc Directive which states that “such an exception or limitation
should not cover uses made in the context of online delivery of protected works or other subject-
matter” is highly problematic. As online dissemination of works becomes more and more important
for cultural heritage institutions, limiting the reproduction exception in such a way is simply
anachronistic as it prevents institutions from using digitised works in a meaningful way. From the
perspective of Europeana which was set up by the European Commission as a platform for online
delivery of cultural heritage objects such a limitation is highly regrettable.

Also technological measures and their relationship with the exceptions benefitting cultural heritage
institutions create problems.

For example, CDs and DVDs are often protected by technological measures, the removal of which
would require the cooperation of the producer. Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive provides that
technological protection measures are protected per se, independently of the scope of protection,
entrusting to voluntary agreements or to subsidiary interventions of Member States the adoption of
appropriate measures to ensure that legitimate users can make effective use of licensed content. As
a result, many libraries are not able to reproduce CDs and DVDs legally acquired and, in a few years,
these materials become unusable due to technological obsolescence.

The situation is actually worse when looking at online works, where the rightholder has full control
and libraries need for example to pay yearly subscription with no preservation guarantees and often
a prohibition to create back-up files for conservation.

The absence of a comprehensive policy on the preservation of digital content (relevant for any public
or private organisation) poses a substantial threat to the survival of digitised material and may also
result in the loss of material produced in digital format (born digital material).

The problems identified in our answer to Q29 could be solved by clarifying the scope of the existing
EU legislation and explicitly broadening the existing exception in Article 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc
Directive, so that it allows institutions to make reproductions of all works in their collection as long as
these are not intended for direct commercial advantage.50

This broadened exception would of course need to be applied in the same way in every Member
State.

Moreover, Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and
limitations and to ensure legitimate utilisations of protected works, regardless of format or mode of
dissemination.

Finally, with regards to subscribed online materials, libraries should be granted a nonexclusive,
royalty-free, perpetual right to archive one complete copy of the subscribed online materials, and to
use the archived materials in the event that access on the original platform is discontinued or
suspended. An exception should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files
for long-term preservation, regardless of the format of publication.

National library or other national infrastructure of the country of utilisation (i.e. the country of the
purchasing library) could be responsible for local hosting for preservation purpose, as well as for
permanent access and use of the licensed materials by authorised users after the termination of a
license contract.

30.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in Article 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc
Directive. Instead of only allowing only specific acts of reproductions it should allow all acts of
reproduction necessary for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums, or
by archives to achieve aims related to their public-interest missions. This should include
reproductions made as part of mass digitisation efforts and reproductions for format shifting.

Reproductions should be limited to internal use which is not for direct commercial or economic
advantage or use in line with other exceptions and limitations allowed for by the InfoSoc Directive
(such as the broadened version of the exception foreseen in Article 5(3)(n) that we propose in

answer to Q34). Reproductions would explicitly be allowed for the purposes of increasing the
operational efficiency and reducing costs of the beneficiary institutions. The exception should only
apply to works that are part of the permanent collection of an institution and not to works that have
been loaned from other institutions (such as interlibrary loans or loans from museum exhibitions).

Broadening the scope of the extension along these lines mirrors the recommendations made as part
of the European Commission commissioned ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society’ from December 2013. 51

Also Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive should be revised in order to enforce exceptions and limitations
and to ensure legitimate utilisations of protected works, regardless of format or mode of
dissemination.

Finally, as set out in our answer to Q29, libraries should be granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
perpetual right to archive one complete copy of the subscribed online materials, and to use the
archived materials in the event that access on the original platform is discontinued or suspended. An
exception should ensure, at the request of the library, the availability of back-up files for long-term
preservation, regardless of the format of publication.

     2. Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.

problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to

the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
[a – Institutional user] Libraries are subject to complex and lengthy negotiations with publishers and
database vendors, which impact upon collection development, duration of access, permitted uses.
Negotiation with publishers is an expensive and time consuming process and most licences are
presented as final, without the ability to negotiate on terms, which are often taken over from other
jurisdictions.

Often libraries entrust negotiation and management of contracts to national or regional institutional
consortia to increase their bargaining power. But the use of consortia for the negotiations is a
remedy, not an optimal solution, and the logic of large numbers may introduce rigidities in pricing
and business models, encouraging the purchase or subscription of large packages of content rather
than the selection of targeted works. It is also extremely common for licences to prevent cross
border access to digital content for research and study by imposing limitations to specific
territory(ies) and/or category of users, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Licensors holding significant
market power happen to re-negotiate licensing fees annually and there have been threats of refusing
to grant licenses at all.

In more general terms this question fails to address the most urgent issue confronting cultural
heritage institutions today: providing online access to works in their collection. Among the existing
exceptions the exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter via dedicated
terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study
comes closest to a mechanism that could enable such uses.

From both the perspective of publicly available libraries, archives and museums as well as the
perspective of our patrons (end users/consumers) the existing exception that allows institutions to
make works in their collections available ‘for the purpose of research or private study, to individual
members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises’ (Article 5(3)n of the InfoSoc
Directive) is extremely limited and not in line with the technological possibilities and the expectations
of citizens anymore.

Limiting the availability of digitised works to dedicated terminals on the premises of cultural heritage
institutions prevents them from reaching citizens that cannot travel to the premises (for example

                                                                                                      30
because they are disabled or because they lack the economic means to do so). Furthermore it is out
of line with the legitimate expectation of users that have been shaped by universal online
accessibility of other services. Europe's citizens and researchers would greatly benefit from online
access to the collections of Europe's publicly funded institutions.

For cultural heritage institutions to fully participate in the digital public space they must be enabled
to offer online services that are available from everywhere and by anyone seeking to “to participate
in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its
benefits”, as enshrined by Article 27.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Online universal
access to the collections of all publicly accessible libraries, Museums and Archives can play an
important role in realising this objective. Being able to offer online access to works in our collections
will also allow these institutions to reach bigger and more diverse audiences. For these reasons we
consider the current exception to be too narrow.

The legal gaps that are present in the current EU copyright framework reinforce the lack of balance in
negotiation powers between institutional users on the one hand and rightholders on the other (and
in some cases between various types of rightholders). These unbalanced power relations do not
contribute to establish an environment which allows the emerging of best practices for negotiation
and contracts.

As a result, licences are not satisfactory at a variety of levels:

● Technical accessibility;

● Inter-library loan and document supply;

● Remote access to born-digital or digitised content (e-lending);

● Utilisations for distance learning courses and programmes;

● Open access to research results;

● Text and Data mining;

● Access and reuse of bibliographic metadata for integration within the library discovery systems;
   and,

● Post-termination access.

[b – End user/consumer] From the perspective of citizens, researchers and other end users it does
not make sense that publicly funded cultural heritage institutions are not allowed to make works in
their collection that are not in commercial circulation anymore available. These institutions have


                                                                                                      31
built and maintained their collections with public funds. Their mission is to provide access to the
knowledge and culture contained in these collections. As long as there are sufficient safeguards that
prevent these institutions from interfering with the normal exploitations of works in their collection
they should be enabled to make their collections available online for non-commercial uses by the
general public. Preventing institutions from doing so means that users will look for information
elsewhere (on platforms such as Wikipedia or Google).

In the long run limiting what cultural heritage institutions can do online with works that are not in
commercial circulation anymore means undermining the position of these institutions. Younger
generations that have been socialised with near universal online access to services will be driven
away from these institutions, annihilating centuries of public investment into these institutions.

For citizens it is perfectly understandable that they cannot expect cultural heritage institutions to
provide unlimited free access to works that still are in commercial circulation, but it does not make
sense at all that institutions have to restrict access to works that are not in circulation anymore
because they are still under copyright protection. It should be noted here that this is also true for
authors who may have a legitimate interest that works that they have created are kept available via
cultural heritage institutions and who often rely on access to works of others as part of their own
creative process.

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The best solution for the problem is broadening the scope of the exception currently provided for in
Article 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc Directive in order to ensure that anyone can make their collections
available on-line via electronic networks, such as the Internet, for scientific and educational purposes
without restriction to on-site terminals. This broadened exception should be made mandatory and
implemented in the same manner in all Member States.

34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
[Open question]
The main element would be a broadening of the existing exception in Article 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc
Directive. Instead of limiting the making available to dedicated terminals on the premises of the
institutions it should apply to making the works available online via public networks such as the
internet. The scope of the exception should further be expanded to not only include ‘the purpose of



                                                                                                     32
research or private study’ by ‘individual members of the public’ but should apply to all non-
commercial uses (including education).

Furthermore, it seems reasonable to limit the scope of the exception to ‘works and other subject-
matter not subject to purchase or licensing terms’ as long as they are still commercially available.
This should be combined with an opt out-clause that would allow rightholders to either prevent the
making available of their works or to negotiate licensing terms with the institutions (either on an
individual basis or collectively).

These conditions are crucial to ensure that the new broadened exception meets the requirements of
the three step test. Limiting the scope of the exception to publicly accessible cultural heritage
institutions and to out-of-commerce works and works that are not subject to licensing terms should
satisfy the 'certain special cases' criterium and cannot, by definition, be in conflict with the 'normal
exploitation' of the works in question. The fact that the exception would be limited to non-
commercial uses of the works made available and that authors can decide to opt-out of the
exception would further ensure that 'the legitimate interests of the author' are not necessarily
prejudiced.

In fact many authors would benefit from improving online access to out-of-commerce works because
works that they have created are kept available via cultural heritage institutions (and are available to
them to build upon or to do research). As a result citizens also greatly benefit, because they are
granted access to works that wouldn't be available through markets players. We refer you also to our
answer to Q37.

This solution would also be in line with the relevant recommendations made in the 'New
Renaissance' Report. The Report recommends that “national governments and the European
Commission should promote solutions for the digitisation of and cross-border access to out of
distribution works” and that “for cultural institutions collective licensing solutions and a window of
opportunity should be backed by legislation, to digitise and bring out of distribution works online, if
rights holders and commercial providers do not do so”.52

       3. E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
  YES – Please explain with specific examples
Yes.

[a – Libraries] Libraries face a number of problems when attempting to negotiate agreements to
enable and facilitate electronic lending. These include:

● Denial of sales of electronic books to libraries by publishers;

● Removal of content that was available for e-lending without informing the library;

● The use of multiple licences and different models, which creates a lack of clarity on the condition
   of access to the content for users; and,

● A deterioration of registered users’ rights (crossing a border with a borrowed book was not a
   problem. Transborder online access to an electronic copy offered by a library is often impossible
   as the result of restrictive licensing conditions.

More generally the question is if it is necessary and desirable to negotiate agreements to enable
electronic lending. Contrary to what is stated in the introduction to this question there is
considerable uncertainty about the status of e-lending under EU law. The Directive on rental and
lending rights (2006/115/EC) does not explicitly exclude e-lending or lending of digital items from its
scope and some libraries argue that based on the current acquis and the UsedSoft decision by the
CJEU (Case C-128/11) they should be allowed to provide e-books in libraries for download. In the
Netherlands the Association of Public Libraries (Vereniging van Openbare Bibliotheken) has brought


                                                                                                    34
the matter before the courts. They started a test case against the collective management
organisation in charge of the lending right arguing that they should be allowed to provide e-books in
libraries for download.

[b - End users] There is currently a lack of clarity on the conditions of access to content for users. In
practice, this means that registered users’ rights are being deteriorated: in the physical offline world,
crossing a border with a borrowed book is not a problem yet it is impossible to have online access to
a library across a border.




37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The best solution for the problem would be to create legal certainty by unambiguously including the
right to e-lending in the EU acquis. While the lending of analogue works is currently being enabled by
the Directive on rental and lending right (2006/115/EC), which is most often considered as an act of
making available, it would probably need to be regulated via an (additional) exception in the InfoSoc
Directive.

In line with our answers to the issues of online availability and reproductions given above, we
consider it necessary that e-lending is covered by a mandatory exception that is harmonised across
the EU. Since e-lending must be available for all books (commercially available or not), it should be
treated separately from the general exception for making works available online that we argue for in
response to Q34. Instead, a new exception should be created specifically for e-lending. This
exception could take the form of a statutory licence with fair compensation for authors.

Moreover, ENCES’s close institutional partner EBLIDA (European Bureau of Library Information and
Documentation Associations) has identified the following ‘key principles on the acquisition of and
access to e-books by libraries’53 that should be put in place across the EU in order to solve the issues

currently encountered:

● All e-book titles available for sale to the public should be available to libraries for acquisition and
     access;

● All e-book titles should be available to libraries at the time of publication;

                                                                                                                       35
● Publishers should deliver e-books in interoperable formats;

● Libraries should be permitted to make available acquired or licensed e-books for a limited period
   of time to a user;

● It should be possible to use the same e-book title simultaneously; and,

● Registered users should be able to download an e-book either in the library or by way of remote
   access via authentication systems.

We refer you for more details to the full set of Principles.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions there are enormous differences between
physical and online collections. These differences are so fundamental that it does not makes sense to
compare the two. The ability to offer access to their collections online frees cultural heritage
institutions from many of the constraints imposed by them by the properties of analogue media and
their physical infrastructure (such as buildings). Being able to offer access to collections online means
that in theory access can be provided to full collections independent from the location of the viewer
or the time of the day. This has the potential to radically improve the ability of publicly funded
cultural heritage institutions to carry out their public mission to provide access to knowledge and
culture.

Unfortunately this enormous potential is currently being held back by copyright rules that
unnecessarily restrict how cultural heritage institutions can exercise their mission in the online
environment. Under the current EU copyright rules cultural heritage institutions are dependent on
permission from rightholders in order to make protected works in their collection available online. As
we have argued above this makes no sense in situations where the majority of works held by these
institutions are not even commercially available.

With the increasing digitisation of our society and media production in particular this has other,
potentially far reaching consequences. Libraries for example can buy all physical publications to
ensure that they are available to the public both during the period of their commercial availability
and thereafter.



                                                                                                      36
The same is not true for digital publications that are not being sold, but licensed: currently libraries
cannot buy licences to all commercially available content because rightholders are free to decide
whether they want to give access to a specific work, and to decide on the terms for such access.
Often such conditions make it impossible to keep such works indefinitely or to make it available to
the community by lending it out.

The consequence of this is that the collection building policy of libraries is increasingly determined by
the publishers and not by the institutions. In the long run this development threatens to undermine
the core function of cultural heritage institutions to preserve the knowledge and culture of our
societies and to keep it available to the public.

With regards to the above the ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and
related rights in the information society’ that was commissioned by the European Commission and
published in December 201354 contains an interesting observation. At the end of the section

discussing inter alia the exception benefitting cultural heritage institutions, the authors observe
that:55

“The large-scale digitization projects ultimately aim at the making available of the collection, (...) the
making available for consultation is increasingly requested to apply at distance and online; and the
lending is shifting to cover the online transmission of digital items. The exception-by-exception
reasoning, which is the model of the InfoSoc Directive, might not be relevant anymore. Maybe it is
time to look at different uses that some categories of users (libraries or educational institutions) or
some objectives (access to culture and knowledge or education) would be privileged to undertake
under a limitation of copyright. (...) the space of non-infringing uses could be defined by their
objective and some general conditions, including a more open requirement that the use does not
exceed what is necessary for its objective. This is a radical move that this study has not made. It could
make our system of exceptions more fit for its purpose and understandable for users and copyright
owners alike. If the requirements for each exception are adequate and legitimate, it would not
sacrifice the high level of protection of copyright and related rights that the EU law has adopted.”

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions such an approach would have many benefits. It
would create room for rethinking Europe's rich tradition of providing access to knowledge and

possibilities offered by digitisation and near universal connectivity.

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
From a users’ perspective, there is no difference in these activities, aside from the convenience of
online tools.


     4. Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other56. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted) 57.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm .
57
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du
1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,
unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the
collecting society.

                                                                                                                      38

     NO – Please explain
No.

From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions this question (and the following) are too
limited.

The issue of mass digitisation is far broader than what can be addressed with the 2011 Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) and the Orphan Works Directive (the other relevant European policy
instrument in this area). Copyright issues related to the mass digitisation of collections and the
subsequent making available of digitised works require a comprehensive approach that cannot be
based the principles of due diligence search and licensing. If we want to enable European cultural
heritage institutions to transfer their collections into the digital age (and there cannot be any doubt
that this is both an important policy objective and a reasonable expectation of users who as
taxpayers fund these organisations) we need a far more comprehensive approach.

Both the Orphan Works Directive and the 2011 MoU on out of commerce works are insufficient to
address the copyright issues arising from mass digitisation projects. In addition, the extremely slow
uptake of the MoU (according to the 2013 ‘Study on the application of Directive 2001/29/EC on
copyright and related rights in the information society’ there is one single project that is ‘inspired’ by
the MoU)58 clearly illustrates that the MoU is not a suitable mechanism for enabling mass digitisation

on a large scale.

The Orphan Works Directive is ill-suited to enable mass digitisation projects. While it will enable
publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives to make orphan works available after a due
diligence search has been carried out for specific works, the requirement of carrying out due
diligence search makes it effectively unusable for mass digitisation projects as this would require
huge additional investments in both time and money.

The inadequacies of both the Orphan Works Directive as well as the MoU can be addressed by an
extension of the scope of the exception created by Article 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc Directive as outlined
in the answer to Q34 above. Doing this would provide cultural heritage institutions a clear legal
framework for operating in the digital environment that would allow us to achieve the aims related
to our public-interest missions.

Taken together this approach would mean that the online activities of cultural heritage institutions
are covered by three targeted exceptions:

● An exception covering the making of reproductions (an expanded version of the current exception
      defined in Article 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive);

● An exception covering the making available of out-of-commerce works an expanded version of
      the current exception defined in Article 5(3)(n) of the InfoSoc Directive; and,

● A new exception covering e-lending, as suggested in our answer to Q37.

B.          Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC59 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

  YES – Please explain
Yes.

The current exception for teaching in the EU law is written in a rather broad and open way but none
of the EU countries have implemented it as broadly as allowed by the InfoSoc Directive.

For example, according to the Polish implementation of the InfoSoc Directive, there is no legal
certainty as regards the use of works for teaching purposes in any manner except for authorised
physical copies on-site. In other words, on-line access is open to question, given the limitation to on-
site terminals which applies also to schools. Therefore, many educational institutions do not engage
in any activities except for traditional on-site teaching, or they seek explicit licenses. At the same
time, many teachers who want to make their classes more attractive and to prepare their students to
the use of ICT, operate in a grey area.

If implemented broadly into the national laws the exception allows for use of any copyrighted
material, including text, film, and multimedia for illustration of teaching in classrooms and also in
online courses. It should also allow for using copyrighted works in teaching compilations, analogue or
digital. Such uses should not require a license. Compensation is not required but allowed and
compensation schemes should be based on actual and proven economic harm.

Because of the narrow implementations of the broad exception provided in the Directive, permitted
use of works in education differs between Member States. This presents special difficulties for the
providers of online open courses that can be access by citizens of various Member States.

The issue not only concerns the types of uses permissible under specific Member States’ educational
exceptions but also the applicable law aspect, as highlighted in our answer regarding the ‘act of
making available’ and its consequences in terms of the definition of the applicable law.

There is thus a need to seek harmonised solutions, if not at international at least at EU level, in order
to create a real single market, without the current fragmentation we experience. Otherwise legal
uncertainty will govern on both sides, with the absurd results we see today: the educational
institutions will continue to seek licenses for uses that do not need to be licensed (and maybe they
will be refused) and the rightholders will be reluctant to grant license for online uses.




                                                                                                      41
The end result is what we face today, i.e. an uncertain climate for public policy for education, as core
matters are left to market forces (in the form of unreasonable prices and conditions, prohibition to
use material online, technical protection measures and restrictive licensing conditions in general).60

ENCES therefore considers that, in the absence of clear guidelines in the law, the temptation is big
for rightholders to determine the extent to which the dissemination of knowledge can take place
exclusively through contractual arrangements, which restrict the acts normally allowed under the
statutory exceptions and limitations.61




43.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The problem would best be solved by making a broad educational exception mandatory for all
Member States. This mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for
illustration of teaching, regardless of the institution, and no room should be left to Member States
for narrow interpretations, as we see them today. It is important to stress that uses of computer
programs, databases and multimedia works (such as video games) should be expressly included.

Moreover, there is also need for education and wide dissemination of information about the scope of
the existing and any future exceptions. For example, in Poland Centrum Cyfrowe conducted a series
of workshops for educators (school and academia teachers) on the issue of the current educational
exception. The school teachers involved demonstrated hardly no knowledge of the existence of the
educational exception. For instance they were afraid of the legal consequences of showing movies in
classrooms, even though this is a clearly allowed under the Polish teaching exception.

This corroborates the findings of the Hargreaves report, which noted that: 62

“Many university academics – along with teachers elsewhere in the education sector – are uncertain
what copyright permits for themselves and their students. Administrators spend substantial sums of
public money to entitle academics and research students to access works which have often been

produced at public expense by academics and research students in the first place. (…) Senior figures
and institutions in the university sector have told the Review of the urgent need reform copyright to
realise opportunities, and to make it clear what researchers and educators are allowed to do.”

This legal uncertainty experienced by the educational sector only gets worse when engaging in cross-
border activities such as e-learning, due to the patchwork implementation of the exception in Article
5.3 of the InfoSoc Directive.

Hence we believe that not only the legislative solution as outlined below in Q45 would be needed.
Campaigns to raise awareness and ‘educate the educators’ in all Member States with respect of the
scope of their rights should also be organised on a regular basis.

44.     What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate the use of content for
illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Various mechanisms exists and have been listed both in the European Commission ‘Green Paper on
Copyright in the Knowledge Economy’63 and the recently published ‘Study on the application of

Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society’. 64

These mechanisms mainly involve extensive collective licensing or agreements with publishers at
national level. For example, universities in Spain pay to collecting societies a flat fee of 5 euro per
student to allow reproduction and online uses of works for teaching purposes.

In France, the works are licensed under special agreements with collecting societies. Each time a
teacher wishes to use a work for the purpose of illustration of teaching, it is checked if the work and
the teacher’s educational institution are covered by the agreement. Such use must be then
registered and reported.

In Finland, the works are licensed under collective licensing schemes.

These mechanisms often create legal uncertainty for educational institutions, since there is a risk that
no agreement or a restricted one will be reached (e.g. in Denmark no agreement has been reached
on digital copying between the collective rights societies and educational institutions, apart from one
with teacher training colleges). They also enhance the inconsistency of use of works across Member
States for educational purposes.

ENCES therefore considers that these mechanisms are counter-productive and lead to inefficient
results, as on the one hand educational institutions sometimes end up seeking licenses for uses that
do not require to be licensed, and on the other hand, certain rightholders prohibit certain permitted
uses by employing technical protection measures (TPMs) or imposing restrictive contractual clauses.

45.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under what
conditions?
[Open question]
A legislative solution at the EU level is needed.

The current educational exception is actually quite broad and many flaws in the current national
systems result from its implementation. Therefore, the exception needs to be made ‘fully’
mandatory, to ensure educators in all Member States can benefit from it to its full extent.

It should also be made explicitly possible for anyone to make works available on-line for educational
purposes without restriction to on-site terminals, both in original form, as well as in the form of an
adaptation or compilation, both in analogue and digital form.

Moreover, the educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for illustration of
teaching, including text, film, and multimedia for illustration of teaching in classrooms as well as in
distance learning. It should not be limited to any types of institution but rather defined by its
purpose: teaching. The same is true as regards the source of financing: the exception should apply
regardless of the source of financing of an educational institution – public or private – as long as the
purpose is non-commercial.

The no license and no compensation model also seems the most appropriate one. Under this model,
the uses for illustration of teaching should not require the consent (license) nor any remuneration to
rightholders. Should fair compensation however be required, notably due to the application of the
three-step test if there is evidence of actual harm, and in a cross-border context (e.g. e-learning)
then the ‘country of origin’ principle should apply, and the educational institution located in the
country where the uploading of the educational materials takes place should pay a fair
remuneration, which should in turn be fairly distributed. This is similar to the country of origin
principle in the Satellite and Cable Directive (93/83/EEC), which has been functioning for close to a
decade and has induced a substantial body of case law.

46.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]


                                                                                                     44
Only a legislative approach could solve the current uncertainties. See our answer to Q43 and Q45:
the problem would best be solved by making a broad educational exception mandatory for all
Member states.

This mandatory educational exception should cover all uses of all types of works for illustration of
teaching, regardless of the institution. It is important to stress that uses of computer programs,
databases and multimedia works (such as video games) should be expressly included.

In the interim, the Commission should clarify in in the documents it plans to release before summer
2014 that all the exceptions in the existing InfoSoc Directive should be interpreted with a maximum
of flexibility, and encourage Member States to broaden their views.




C.          Research
Directive 2001/29/EC65 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?
      YES – Please explain
Yes.

Currently research activities are covered by the same exception as educational uses. It is therefore a
broad provision. The type of research institution is not relevant: it may be publicly funded or private
as long as the research itself is non-commercial.

Contrary to the educational exception, the exception for research is not restrictively adopted in
national laws. However, the main problems with accessing and using scientific materials are mainly
practical. The exception allows for their use for research purposes, but they are usually protected by
restrictive licenses or technical protection measures (TPMs) – or simply only published in hard copies
and not accessible. For example, licenses require that works are made available using certain



65
     Article 5(3)a of Directive 2001/29.

                                                                                                    45
networks or software only. Also, text and data mining (TDM) is often explicitly prohibited in licenses,
or allowed only to a limited extent.




             NION


48.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The main problems are the lack of access to scientific material due to prohibitive licensing and/or
technical protection measures (TPMs).

On the one hand, a legislative track should be pursued whereby a specific exception for research
should be introduced, that is both mandatory and with a clear scope. Indeed, the current ‘voluntary’
approach to the list of exceptions leads to legal uncertainty and abuse by some rightholders.

Once again, the approach should be purpose-driven, i.e. the exception should not apply to particular
beneficiaries but be defined by its purpose: conducting research. It should extend to works, subject
matters of related rights, computer programs and databases. The uses allowed for research should
not be limited by way of illustration and should cover a wide range of possibilities in order to enable
unrestricted digital research. Scientists should be free to subject any article published or made
available online to data mining, extractions, variations or other digital manipulations provided they
give proper attribution. The exception should cover commercial and non-commercial activities. If
deemed necessary, uses for the purpose of commercial research could be subject to fair
compensation but the levies should be low and well administered. However, under this option,
guidelines on the meaning of commercial should be provided by EU legislation.

As should be the case for all exceptions and limitations, it should be clearly stated by in the
legislation that contractual or technical (TPM) overrides of this exception are prohibited.

ENCES reminds the European Commission that the legislative approach outlined above has been
proposed and substantiated by the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and
Tax Law in its response to the ‘Green Paper Copyright in the Knowledge Economy’ consultations in
200866 and further defined and supported by Reichman and Okediji.67

Apart from this legislative solution, the access problems could also in part be solved by promoting
and implementing open access principles. As recommended by the Commission itself,68 the results of

publicly funded research project should be published in open access models. The Commission should
further promote and encourage open access models, notably in its Horizon 2020 research framework
programme.

Finally, there is also a need to promote among researchers and publishers data awareness and a
culture of sharing. This could notably be done by establishing mechanisms and processes to
recognise and reward and even require good data sharing practices.

49.    What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use of content for
research purposes? How successful are they?
[Open question]
Open access to scientific articles and other types of research result is recognised by the EU and
research institutions in Europe as an important mechanism for facilitating access to research content.
Horizon 2020, EU’s research initiative, includes an obligation to make research results openly
available. However, as noted above in Q48, there is a need for formulating policies that encourage
implementations of open access and sharing of knowledge in a more systematic manner. Moreover,
publishers should be prohibited from forcing researchers to sign contracts that do not allow them to
adopt an open access approach.

Alternatively, some Member States use extended collective licensing mechanisms to cover also
research activities.

However, researchers more often face restrictive individual licences and/or technical restrictions (see
our answer to Q47). Publishers, for example, offer individual licenses to allow text and data mining,
which often comprise restrictive conditions that can be incompatible with the terms and conditions
of other publishers. The drawbacks of such mechanisms are the same as described for the
mechanisms in the teaching exception (see our answer to Q44).

D.       Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC69 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 70.

The Marrakesh Treaty71 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the application of limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of works published in special formats, including across
borders?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
[a – Person with a disability or an organisation representing persons with disabilities]

Yes.

At present, persons with disabilities – in particular the visually impaired, deaf , dyslexic and other
print disabled persons – in the EU and globally, only have access to a very small fraction of the
reading material published each year.

This situation is especially limited with regards to the cross border shipment or exchange of
accessible formats for persons with disabilities given that Member States and International law up

until now does not allow the legal cross border exchange of reading content among institutions and
organisations that serve the cultural and academic needs of persons with disabilities.

The ratification and effective implementation by the EU and its Member States of the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Marrakech Treaty72 could overcome much of this problem

for visually impaired persons, but these exceptions and limitations to copyright should also be
extended to person with other disabilities.

[b – Organisation providing services for persons with disabilities]

Yes.

The distribution, copying and communication of works published in special formats across borders
are not included in EU legislation. Copyright exceptions are applied on a Member State level and do
not permit cross border shipments of protected works.




51.    If there are problems, what could be done to improve accessibility?
[Open question]
The swift ratification, implementation and application of the WIPO Marrakech Treaty73 by the EU and

its Member States is needed to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities.

A broader interpretation of EU exceptions applied to other disabilities should also be included in EU
and national legislations.

52.   What mechanisms exist in the market place to facilitate accessibility to content?
How successful are they?
[Open question]
There are not enough mechanisms in place at present.

To a great extent there has been a market failure to supply accessible formats for persons with
disabilities. Despite the great technical advancements in the digital space, most persons with
disabilities cannot take advantage of these possibilities due to the lack of availability of formats, cost
and legal restrictions in copyright laws.

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics 74 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”75. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when providing services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?




74
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

     See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring more content                     online”:

                                                                                                       50
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the use of text and data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?
     YES – Please explain
[a – End user/consumer or an institutional user]

Yes.

From a legal point of view, the problem with text and data mining is that some consider it may
infringe copyright because it is necessary to make copies of content to convert it into machine
readable format. Moreover, because it prevents the copying of large portions of databases, the
Database Directive is also seen as a legal barrier to text and data mining. As a result of the legal
uncertainty hence created, the full potential of text and data mining for Europe is hardly exploited,
which represents a loss in productivity and competitiveness for Europe, as well as missed innovation
opportunities to the benefit of users, notably in the health sector.76

From a practical/technical point of view, technical protection measures (TPMs), which are protected
by law, can prevent users from downloading content in order to ‘mine’ it. These measures hence also
seriously impede research.

54.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
Researchers must be able to share the results of text and data mining, as long as these results are not
substitutable for the original copyright work - irrespective of copyright law, database law or
contractual terms to the contrary.

For ENCES, it should be clarified that text and data mining does not fall under copyright protection,
insofar as it merely extracts new information or data from existing materials and consists of a
transformative use that does not take away value from the original or acts as a substitute.

Moreover, a specific exception to this effect allowing the copying of content for the purpose of text
and data mining is necessary. It should also be explicitly stated in the law that technical protection
measures (TPMs) and contracts should not override such an exception. Finally, such an exception
should not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial purposes as, for research
institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer and such a differentiation would not be in the
public interest.

55.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
As stated in our answer to Q54, it should be clarified that text and data mining does not fall under
copyright protection, insofar as it merely extracts new information or data from existing materials
and consists of a transformative use that does not take away value from the original or acts as a
substitute.

Moreover, a specific exception to this effect allowing the copying of content for the purpose of text

should not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial purposes as, for research
institutions, this would prevent knowledge transfer and such a differentiation would not be in the
public interest.

56.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
Only a legislative approach can solve the issues faced (see our answer to Q54 and Q55).

It is crucial to realise that licensing will not work as an alternative solution.

● First, the negotiation of licences is resource intensive and un-scalable, and the starting point is
     often one of lack of balance of negotiating powers.

● Secondly, licences do not address the current ambiguity around the mining of the open Web.;
     and,

● Finally, licensing text and data mining (TDM) is unjustifiable as no licence should be required to
     mine.

77
  The UK government took such an approach, with the stated objective to ‘shift some of the current uncertainty about
whether something can be done lawfully into a question of whether a licence is needed or not’. See, Intellectual Property
Office. (2012, December). Modernising Copyright: A Modern, Robust and Flexible Framework. Government Response to

An illustration of the vicious circle created by licensing in a TDM context can be found in the recent
discussions triggered by the new policy on TDM proposed by Elsevier.78 Whilst extensive analysis is
available online79 on the flaws this policy comprises, ENCES would like to highlight a few key
shortcomings:80

 Artificial limitations in terms of the number of articles that can be accessed per week per
     institution.
 Mandatory use of Elsevier’s ScienceDirect application programming interface (API), prohibiting
     researchers to use their own mining robots and tools that are often customized to the specific
     needs of their research.
 Obligation for libraries to sign up to the licensing terms, as well as for each researcher to do so
     and to declare the purpose for which the researcher will be using the minded data.
 Prohibition for anyone agreeing to sign the licence to ‘not disadvantage Elsevier’s product’, hence
     implying that researchers finding flaws in articles they mine might not be able to share these
     findings publicly.81
 Limitation of the mining to text, to the exclusion of images, even though for many researchers,
     figures, charts, etc. – which are actually data – are sometimes more important than text.82
    Obligation for the output of the TDM research to be licensed under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC
     licence,83 which means that the product of the mining cannot be used for commercial purposes.

To that one must add that in such a logic of licensing for TDM, new hurdles are being created for
researchers wishing to mine articles from different publishers (as they would need to sign
agreements with each of them, even if their works are available in the same library) are wishing to
collaborate across different institutions.

57.     Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute barriers to the use of
text or data mining methods?

[Open question]
From a practical/technical point of view, technical protection measures (TPMs) can prevent users
from downloading content in order to ‘mine’ it. This notably seriously impedes research.

Moreover, there is still a gap in the availability of technology and skills for text and data mining, but
as legal barriers are reduced, market-led solutions to fill these gaps should emerge.


F.       User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs84. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions 85.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on

84
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording),
or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings),
and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

ENCES has no comments on this question.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
The overly rigid and outdated list of limitations and exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive has to be
opened up. While in the US Copyright system the general Fair Use clause allows for at least some
flexibility, the European system of limitations and exceptions cannot deal with new usage practices.

A more flexible approach is needed, combining the current system of a list of exceptions (but made
mandatory for all Member States and specified as not exhaustive), but stating specifically that these
cases must be interpreted as applying to ‘similar uses’ and add a more general open norm based on
‘fair use’ or general principles of fairness. Additional exceptions also need to be added to make the
list more robust in light of technological evolution and changes in users’ behaviour.

62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
Two main legislative changes are necessary:

1) More flexibility: A more flexible approach is needed, combining the current system of a list of
     exceptions (but made mandatory for all EU countries and specified as not exhaustive), but stating
     specifically that these cases must be interpreted as applying to ‘similar uses’ and add a more
     general open norm based on ‘fair use’ or general principles of fairness. The German ‘bagatelle
     clause’ can also be considered as a possible starting point for such an open norm that would
     render legal many everyday online activities that currently infringe copyright even though they
     cause no harm to the rightholders.

2) Introduction of a remix exception: In addition to more flexibility, there should be an explicit remix
     exception to the InfoSoc Directive. This remix exception would permit creative re-combinations
     based on existing works. Such an approach was taken with success in Canada, under Article 29.21
     of the UGC Canada Copyright Act.86


63.    If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
[Open question]
We see no feasible alternative to legislative changes. See our answers to Q61 and Q 62.

III.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying87. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees 8889.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions90 in the digital environment?

ENCES believes this question mixes two issues.

First, the question raises the issue that a user could be subjected to a private copying levy to make a
private copy of content that he or she legally acquired. We believe that the copyright framework
should be flexible enough to allow for uses such as, private copying, parody, etc.. Such exceptions are
implemented on the basis that they do not interfere with the normal exploitation of a work, and,
therefore, do not unreasonably prejudice the rightholder.

Moreover, there is no clear evidence that every uncompensated usage of a work constitutes harm to
the rightholder, just the opposite, seeing that it can be demonstrated that certain usages can
positively affect revenue stream from other means of exploitations.

Moby, for example, decided in October 2013 to open up his 11th album ‘innocents’ to the Internet,

and made the album’s singles, videos and stem collection available for free to download as a
BitTorrent Bundle.92 This resulted in:93


● 8.9 million people downloading the Bundle;

● 419 thousand of them opted into Moby’s mailing list;

● 130 thousand of them went to the album on iTunes; and,

● 68 thousand new remixes were created as a result of the Bundle.

Moby’s ‘innocents’ Bundle ended up being to the Internet’s most downloaded torrent in 2013.

Secondly, ENCES notices that more and more service licence the content to the user. In practice this
means that when users purchase content online they are allowed to make a certain number of
copies. These copies are included in the purchasing price. So, adding a private copying levy on top,
would imply that users are charged twice (i.e. in the form of a licence and a levy) for the same use of
the content they acquired.

It should be emphasised that licensing of content should not hinder users in enjoying cultural goods,
as this would be a restriction of their freedom of communication and access to cultural heritage.

In general, ENCES considers that Member States should only be allowed to introduce compensation
mechanisms, if 1) evidence shows a clear harm that cannot be remedied through other means and if
2) they can clearly demonstrate that the benefits will outweigh the costs.




66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
It is hard to imagine that the European Commission would consider hindering the development of its
cloud computing industry by raising the possibility of imposing private copying levies, and as such
create legal and financial uncertainty.

Private copying is recognised as an exception in the InfoSoc Directive, as it does not interfere with
the normal exploitation of a work or other subject matter of the rightholder. There is an unexplained
– and possibly inexplicable – assumption that all technological development negatively impacts
rightholders, and that they need to be compensated for the assumed losses arising from them.
While, more user-friendly means of accessing and using copyrighted works could encourage citizens
to purchase content – boosting and not reducing rightholders’ revenues.

The reasoning behind private copying levies is to compensate for alleged economic losses.
Introducing any levy should therefore be based on credible empirical evidence that rightholders
suffer a loss. At the time being, such a loss has never been clearly evidenced. Even if evidenced, it
should be considered if it is proportionate to add layers of bureaucracy and costs in recovering this
loss through levies. If so, it should be ensured that the most economically viable option is chosen in
order to impose and collect these levies.

It should be emphasised that technological developments have a great impact on content delivery.
Antonió Vitorino underlined in his recommendations, resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies entrusted by the European Commission, that stakeholders expect a
shift from an ownership to a access based model. 94 Important market changes can be observed, and

new means of usage not even requiring a private copy to be made are appearing, such as, video-on-
demand (VOD), catch-up television, etc.. With these new usages no longer requiring private copies it
is difficult to allege any harm.

In the interest of democratic legitimacy, we also believe that the European Commission should
rethink Article 6 of the InfoSoc Directive, as it difficult to grasp that legislation can create a right to
avail of exceptions and simultaneously provide for legal protection of technological protection
measures hindering these same rights.

67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?95
     YES – Please explain
Yes.

ENCES considers that if private copying or any other levies apply, citizens need to be informed about:

1) How much is being levied;

2) For what purpose the levy is collected; and,

3) How the collected levy is being put to use.

Increased transparency means more trust from consumers. Any mechanism that would educate the
general public about the fact and amounts of money collected and distributed through schemes,
such as levies, is thus a good idea.

Redistribution mechanisms need to be transparent to not lose their legitimacy in the eyes of citizens.
Especially, as a large chunk of the collected levies is currently lost to administrative costs. According
to an economic analysis of alternative models of compensation for private copying by ENTER there is
an “economic waste of at least 51.2 Cents for each 1 Euro collected”.96 The inadequacy and

inefficiency of the current copyright levy systems lead the authors to conclude that these levies are
“a poison to the economic system and do not even support right-holders as mandated”.97

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments 98.

should be considered if it is proportionate to add layers of bureaucracy and costs in recovering this
loss through levies. If so, it should be ensured that the most economically viable option is chosen in

2) For what purpose the levy is collected; and,

3) How the collected levy is being put to use.

Increased transparency means more trust from consumers. Any mechanism that would educate the

“a poison to the economic system and do not even support right-holders as mandated”.100

Moreover, imposing a levy on various digital media and devices bought by consumers or others, such
as freelancers, businesses and even creators themselves, that will never be used to make private
copies of copyrighted material is hard to grasp. This results in consumers and others ending up
paying to reproduce material they authored, when making a back-up of their computer files on an
external hard drive, transferring their pictures from the memory card of their digital camera to their
computer, printing their resume or a business proposal. Levies are even charged on devices that are
perhaps never used to reproduce content, such as smartphones used for calling, texting and e-
mailing.

The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) already recognised the unfairness of private
copying levy systems, and consider that they should “certainly not apply to hard drives used by
businesses in the course of their industrial and commercial activities”.101



IV.      Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers102 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract 103. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
While this consultation is about copyright and not about developing legislation-based business
models for the authors and performers, we believe that the position of authors and performers can
be improved by strengthening their rights vis-à-vis publishers and other distributors of their work.
Authors and performers should have the ability to regain control of works that they have assigned to
third parties if those third parties do not actively exploit their works (anymore). Such a non-usus
clause can for example be found in the changes to the Dutch copyright act that is currently being
reviewed by the Dutch parliament.

Moreover, authors of scientific articles and other short works (such as contributions to proceeding of
academic proceedings should have the (time delayed) right to publish such works in an open access
publication that cannot be waived or transferred to another party such as a scientific publisher. Such
clauses aimed at ensuring public access to publicly funded academic research can be found in the
German copyright law and in the proposed revisions to the Dutch copyright act.

73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?
  YES – Please explain
Yes.

Given that the European Union is currently promoting open access to publicly funded research as
part of the Horizon2020 program it seems reasonable to create the legal conditions that ensure that
authors of academic works can fulfil their open access obligations even when they also work with
scientific publishers. In addition and in line with our previous answers we believe that any other
measure to improve the standing of authors and performers vis-à-vis publishers and other
distributors can best be strengthened at the EU level.

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
There is a need to undertake a thorough analysis of the economics underlying the creation and
dissemination of culture, since currently it is often wrongly assumed that every use of work should be
remunerated in order to satisfy creators’ interests.

There exists evidence that these interests are not harmed, or that the public interest benefits, in
cases where some uses are not remunerated, and this evidence should be systematically gathered
and analysed before any legislative action is undertaken to further empower copyright monopolies.


  V. Respect for rights



                                                                                                   64
Directive 2004/48/EE104 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text105. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose106. One means to do this could be to clarify the role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure107. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?

Respect for rights is not created by enforcement, but by establishing rules that are perceived as fair
and balanced by as many people as possible. The most effective way to improve ‘respect for rights’
would be to take user concerns seriously when addressing the other issues identified throughout our
answers to the entire consultation.

The focus should be on adapting the rules to the digital era and not on strengthening enforcement,
which is already misused – one illustration of this misuse is the ‘blackmail’ practised in Germany by
certain legal practitioners who exploit the ease of access to personal data through the IPR
Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC).




76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright

    For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend on the

    This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
The limitation of intermediaries’ liability is important and is a cornerstone of the functioning of the
Internet.

Without it, there is a high risk of censorship and of going against freedom of expression, freedom of
communication but also freedom to conduct a business. Middlemen should not be liable and
privatised enforcement is not the solution. The rule of law needs to apply and the SOPA/PIPA
discussions triggered by the US have shown that there is no support for such enforcement actions
among citizens.

The problem is that community wireless networks, anonymising services, fixed internet service
providers, online data storage places, search engines and other actors suffer uncertainty because of
the intermediary liability in copyright. As a result, they sometimes take down things that are legal,
out of fear of being sued. That is bad for EU citizens’ free speech rights and can chill innovation and
creativity.

The European Commission should hence not promote or encourage ‘cooperation’ of intermediaries,
as this would be in breach of Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

The current copyright system is completely tilted towards the rightholders, and does not take users’
much into consideration, if at all.

Copyright should aim to encourage creativity and innovation for the benefit of the society as a whole.
However, current copyright law fails to achieve its dual mission, as the notion of consumers’ rights is
absent and enforcement measures are often in contradiction with fundamental rights such as
freedom of speech, privacy and right to access information.

Consumers do not know what they can and cannot do with copyright protected material. The current
legislation is simply out of date and fails to respond to the challenges of the digital environment.



                                                                                                       66
              VI.       A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES


  NO OPINION
No opinion.

ENCES hesitates to provide an answer to this question because the Commission has not given
sufficient information as to what it is suggesting under the heading ‘single EU Copyright Title’. With
respect to science and education, a single EU Copyright Title could be close to something like a fair
use clause or more specific, to a comprensive copyright clause in favour of science and education
which would make most, in not all of the existing limitations and exception unnecessary.

79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
Harmonisation should be dealt with in the near future. There is too much legal uncertainty and the
adaptation to the digital era needs to happen now! The more the EU waits the less attractive the
European market is, the less innovation can be developed and the less EU citizens have access to the
same content and services.

While looking at reviewing the current EU laws, EU countries should be encouraged to promote more
flexibility and a user-friendly approach to how they implement their copyright laws.

Interim solutions such as clarifying the current InfoSoc Directive to ensure it is adapted in the
broadest and most flexible manner by Member States is an immediate action point that the



                                                                                                   67
European Commission could already undertake in the documents it plans to release before summer
2014. Interpretative guidelines could also allow to create more clarity at an EU level.

Moreover, the adoption of such a single Title should not result into the adoption of a set of rules
representing the lowest common denominator between all Member States.


VII. Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
Users need to be protected from the adverse effects of technical protection measures (TPMs).
Circumvention of TPMs must be allowed when exercising user rights created by Exceptions and
Limitations or when using Public Domain works. Using TPMs to hinder or impede privileged uses of a
protected work or access to public domain material should be sanctioned. This is particularly true for
science and education.

There is also a problem due to excessive enforcement of copyright in the EU notably due to misuses
of the IPR Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC), but also excessive removal of content. This needs to
be stopped and framed in a proper manner that balances the different rights and freedoms at stake.
