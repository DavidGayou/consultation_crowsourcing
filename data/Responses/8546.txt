I. Access to your content across Europe


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other  than  the
one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)





€ NO





€ NO OPINION





3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.


[Open question]


We always grant multi-territorial licences.





5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to  certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





€ NO





€ NO OPINION





7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain





€ NO – Please explain


This is not necessary for our market share.


€ NO OPINION





8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations
– i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?





€ YES

€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[1])







€ NO OPINION




9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right  have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an  author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or  not),
on your remuneration,  or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief[2])?


€ YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





10.  [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





4. Download to own digital content


14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a  service  provider:]  What
would be the consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the
resale of previously purchased digital content? Please  specify  per  market
(type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


We cannot conceive that e-books can be sold and leased through an  exception
without dramatic consequences for our market. There  are  good  reasons  why
selling second hand only for physical paper  copies  that  wear  over  time.
This is not the case of e-books whose quality does not deteriorate. Allow  a
second hand market  for  e-books  would  have  disastrous  consequences  for
publishers and readers.


I. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


We see no problem as most important exceptions to the benefit of  education,
research, libraries or persons  with  a  disability  are  in  place  in  all
legislation across Europe.


€ NO OPINION


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases








€ NO – Please explain


This  would  not  be  consistent  with  respect  of  national  and  cultural
traditions, which are part of our copyright laws.


€ NO OPINION


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why








€ NO – Please explain why


The existing framework is sufficiently flexible


€ NO OPINION



26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to








€ NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


As a publisher, we rely on exceptions such as quotes. As  a  fact,  we  sell
books in Europe and the world. We never encountered any problem.


€ NO OPINION


27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of  “fair
compensation”  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part   of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

It is crucial that exceptions be  paid.  If  applications  are  made  ​​across
borders, we must decide which party must pay,  as  cross-border  use  should
not lead to the disappearance of compensation that are due  to  the  authors
and publishers for the consequences except on  the  commercial  exploitation
of their works.

Access to content in libraries and archives


Preservation and archiving

28. (b) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?

€ YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and  the  type  of  use  in
question.








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


Off-premises access to library collections



32.  (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with  institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,   to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of  research  and  private
study?

[Open question]

Yes, we have : accesses to our databases.





E – lending


36. (c) [In particular if you are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain with specific examples


Yes, we have : accesses to our databases.

€ NO


€ NO OPINION



Teaching

42.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION


44. What mechanisms exist in the market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

[Open question]

Our collective management companies have negotiated licenses with schools  /
universities for use of our content for teaching.







Research


47.  (b) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





49. What mechanisms exist in the Member States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?


Our collective management companies have negotiated licenses with schools  /
universities for use of our content for teaching.



Disabilities


50.  (c) [In particular if you are a right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples








€ NO


€ NO OPINION





52. What mechanisms exist in the market place  to  facilitate  accessibility
to content? How successful are they?


[Open question]


With ePub3, we are now able to make much more e-books available. Most of
our books are available in ePub3.





Text and data mining

53. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in
relation to copyright protected content, including across borders?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


At the request of researchers and for  non-commercial  purposes,  publishers
already grant permissions for TDM. We license  to  standard  conditions  and
ask no extra charge. We may also allow TDM for commercial  actors,  but  the
license terms will apply then.


€ NO OPINION


55. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

see Cross Ref’s Prospect. (http://www.crossref.org/).

57.  Are  there  other  issues,  unrelated  to  copyright,  that  constitute
barriers to the use of text or data mining methods?

[Open question]


Establish a specific technical environment TDM can be a challenge and a
load (such as an API allowing the researcher to download the content before
use.)


User-generated content


58. (c) [In particular if you are a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples





€ NO


€ NO OPINION


59. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing  works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?


€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


Our books have a ISBN. When we create a work based on  a  preexisting  work,
we rely on the exception of quote or parody or we ask the  necessary  rights
to the holders of the original rights. We've always done it this way and  do
not believe that a change in legislation is necessary.


€ NO OPINION






II. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain why


There are already good arrangements in place to ensure  that  contracts  are
balanced and not abusive. Contract law is a national competence and  we  see
no need to create an EU contract law covering  contracts  in  the  field  of
copyright.


€ NO OPINION



 III. Respect for rights

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

€ YES – Please explain


We are generally satisfied  with  the  current  legislation,  but  there  is
always room for improvement.
Publishers could benefit from a "presumption of ownership" on the  basis  of
the rights assigned by their  authors.  It  would  help  to  have  a  "locus
standi" to be able to take legal action against infringers. We  are  not  in
favor of an action against the people,  but  we  support  the  targeting  of
illegal sites.
These sites which infringe copyright may seem  "non-commercial",  but  there
has frequent signs that  they  reap  a  considerable  amount  of  money  (eg
through advertising).


€ NO – Please explain











€ NO OPINION


76. In particular, is the current legal framework   clear  enough  to  allow
for sufficient involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet  service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

We would find it helpful if some intermediates such as advertisers,  payment
services, registration of domain names and search engines that benefit  from
pirate sites and piracy in general  offices  were  encouraged  to  cooperate
more in efforts to stop illegal activities.


77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?

€ YES – Please explain








€ NO – Please explain


These important rights must  be  respected,  without  one  taking  over  the
other.





€ NO OPINION

-----------------------
[1] The objective of implementing a  “country  of  origin”  approach  is  to
localise the copyright relevant act  that  must  be  licenced  in  a  single
Member State (the "country of  origin",  which  could  be  for  example  the
Member State in which the content is uploaded or where the service  provider
is established), regardless of in how many Member States  the  work  can  be
accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable
retransmission).
[2] Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the  right
holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
