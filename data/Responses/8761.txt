     I.     Introduction
A.        Context of the consultation
Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in
which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for
those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing
distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for
citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or
entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders.
This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to
adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the
system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to
the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring
that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to
support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and
investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.
In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1 the Commission set out two
parallel tracks of action: on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework23 with a view to a decision in 2014 on
whether to table legislative reform proposals, and on the other, to facilitate practical industry-
led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.
The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4. The Commission welcomes the
practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border
portability of services, user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text and data
mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledges to be a further step in making
the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of
the fact that two groups – user-generated content and text and data mining – did not reach
consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the
results. The discussions and results of "Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in
the context of the review of the legislative framework.
As part of the review process, the Commission is now launching a public consultation on
issues identified in the Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:
"territoriality in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright
in the digital age; fragmentation of the EU copyright market; and how to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy in the wider
context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the October 2013 European Council

Conclusions5 "Providing digital services and content across the single market requires the
establishment of a copyright regime for the digital age. The Commission will therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important to
modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate licensing, while ensuring a high level
protection of intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural diversity".
This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on
the "Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy"6, the "Green Paper on the online
distribution of audiovisual works"7 and "Content Online"8. These consultations provided
valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as the
territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to
the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the
audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value
chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited
widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper
on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

     II.    Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.   Why is it not possible to access many online content services from
anywhere in Europe?
[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital transmissions and the
segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]
Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers, musicians - do not enjoy
a single protection in the EU. Instead, they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national
rights in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU
Directives. However, differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights is limited to
the territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus territorial in the sense that
rights are acquired and enforced on a country-by-country basis under national law9.
The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. by a music streaming
service, or by an online e-book seller – therefore requires, in principle, an authorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Rightholders are,
of course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across borders. A number of steps
have been taken at EU level to facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a Directive
on Collective Rights Management10 should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial licences in musical works for online services11; the structured stakeholder dialogue
“Licences for Europe”12 and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13.
"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue of cross-border portability, i.e.
the ability of consumers having subscribed to online services in their Member State to keep
accessing them when travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,
representatives of the audio-visual sector issued a joint statement affirming their commitment
to continue working towards the further development of cross-border portability14.
Despite progress, there are continued problems with the cross-border provision of, and access
to, services. These problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access services that
are made available in Member States other than the one in which they live. Not all online
services are available in all Member States and consumers face problems when trying
to access such services across borders. In some instances, even if the “same” service is
available in all Member States, consumers cannot access the service across borders (they can
only access their “national” service, and if they try to access the "same" service in another
Member State they are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).

9
  This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on several occasions.

    Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2012 on collective
management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online
uses in the internal market, COM(2012) 372 final.
11
    Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in the management of online rights for musical
works in contrast to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by right holders such as film or record
producers or by newspaper or book publishers.

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of rights and difficulties associated with
the clearing of rights in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing agreements
between right holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may also be
at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).
The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further measures (legislative or non-
legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15
to increase the cross-border availability of content services in the Single Market, while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders.

1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?
  YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of
content concerned (e.g. premium content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual
content in general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications
and other software)

     NO
     NO OPINION


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?
   YES - Please explain whether such problems, in your experience, are related to copyright
or to other issues (e.g. business decisions relating to the cost of providing services across
borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide examples
indicating the Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium
content such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music, e-books,
magazines, journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software).

     NO OPINION
It is the main interest of the record labels and their businesses that their music is made
available to as many consumers as possible and that the services facilitating these are as
consumer friendly as possible. The record labels have already made their content available to
consumers across the EU via a wide range of services. These services are already available
across Europe providing over 30 million of songs for the EU-consumers and have granted
both EU-wide licenses and even worldwide licenses. Due to the labels pro-active work in this
area digital music is available all through Europe. In connection to this - and as shown in
information provided for “Licenses for Europe” - musical works are available across Europe
and the music industry in general has revolutionized itself within the current legal framework

   For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a European Copyright Code (establishing
a single title) see section VII of this consultation document.

                                                                                                     8
to accommodate the digital age and the digital use of music is currently the largest source of
income for the record labels due to a wide range of services with more services entering the
market.
The current legal framework already provides a framework where consumers gain
accessibility to copyrighted materials and a market where the stakeholders are willing to
invest in. In order to ensure the same progress as we are already seeing it is essential that the
framework is not changed and that the focus is on giving the legal services the best possible
conditions for entering a market without competition from non-legal services.
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.
[Open question]
Upon request record labels often grant both EU-licenses and world-wide licenses either
directly or through collective management organizations. This however, does not necessarily
mean that the services are launched across Europe or the world at the same time as the
services often have to focus on the consumers needs in each territory and have to customize
the service to the consumers needs. Furthermore the services may need to establish a local
office and have the necessary capital (i.e. make local marketing partnerships) to launch the
service in a new territory. The current framework of copyright does not limit the expansion of
legal services, the step for step approach is due to practical reflection on how to ensure that
the launch of the service is successful.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?
As mentioned above the best way to for legal services to launch in all territories is to ensure
that the legal framework is not changed as this would create uncertainty for investors. The
current legal framework with regards to copyright already ensures a basis for the launch of
services. For an overview of legal music sites in Europe please see www.pro-music.org. This
IFPI website – as mentioned in “Licenses for Europe” – contains information of the launched
legal music services in Europe.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?
  YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO
There is no reason why a national right should impose territorial restrictions as the record
labels only benefit from their repertoire being used as much as possible by legal services and


                                                                                               9
being available for as many consumers as possible. This is also why the record labels provide
multi-territorial licenses.
     NO OPINION


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?
N/A – please see the response to question 5.


         – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….




7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
Legal services are already available across Europe. This can bee seen at he website
www.pro-music.org (see the response to question 4), which provides information about what
legal services are available in Europe. The best way to ensure the future life of these services
is to not change the legal framework that the services have based their business on.
     NO OPINION

B.   Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?
[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]
The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital
environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC16 on the harmonisation of certain
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this


16
  Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of
certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

                                                                                                        10
field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of
software17 and databases18.
Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders19 which
are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other
protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.
The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to
authorise or prohibit the making of copies20, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission –
e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the
communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the
dissemination of the works in digital networks21. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.

1.       The act of “making available”
Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither what is covered by the making available right (e.g. the
upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor where the act of
“making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single
territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights
need to be cleared (does the act of "making available" happen in the country of the upload
only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of
a certain Member State's public22. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act
(which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online
service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions,
a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.
8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?
     YES – please see the response to question 9.

   Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection
of computer programs.
18
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases.
19
   Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in,
respectively, their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’ content protected by copyright is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is referred to as “other subject
matter”.
20
   The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although temporary acts of reproduction of
a transient or incidental nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC).
21
   The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public by wire or wireless means and to authorise
or prohibit the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
22
   See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar) and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and
related rights, and Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to jurisdiction see also joined

9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief24)?
     YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed
There is currently no need for clarification or changes. The European Court of Justice has
already been given the opportunity to take a position on the issue. The right is derived from
international treaties as well as European law and the understanding of the right of making
available has not been an issue for the record labels. The right of making available (including
other rights) and changes in this area (as opposed to case law based clarification) would
harm the music industry with regards to both licensing and enforcement. The market/record
labels have been able to license on the basis of the current legal system and have not
encountered practical issues – for example due to differences in national law – or issues of
enforcement with regards to the territorial scope of the “making available” right. A
clarification or change in this area could cause insecurity/uncertainty with regards to
investing in this area and halt the progress that has already been made under the current
legislation.

2.        Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation
Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and
law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the
licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?

23
   The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is to localise the copyright relevant act that
must be licenced in a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be for example the Member
State in which the content is uploaded or where the service provider is established), regardless of in how many
Member States the work can be accessed or received. Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level
with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning
copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission).
24
   Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                              12
   YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to address such
problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation
to achieve the "bundling of rights")


The rights with regards to downloads are licensed and exploited more than ever before. The
market has sought and found pragmatic solutions in this are and will continue to do so.

3.      Linking and browsing
Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another.
They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25 in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the
public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.
A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of
works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU26 as to whether such
copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction
provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?
   YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case in general, or under specific
circumstances, and why
The provision of a hyperlink should, al least in certain circumstances, be subject to the
authorisation of the right holders. This was confirmed by the CJEU in the Svensson case (C-
466/12). The Svensson decision also confirms that authorisation for linking does not extent to
links to copies that have been made available without the permission of the right holders. For
instance, linking to a copy that was made available by a third party without the consent of the
right holder would clearly violate the right of communication to the public.
The Svensson decision also means that authorisation for linking does not extend to links to
copies that have been made available without the permission of the right holders. For
instance, linking to a copy that was made available by a third party without the consent of the
right holder would clearly violate the right of communication to the public.
An additional example is piracy via BitTorrent where illegal content is accessed via links that
direct users to the location where they can access content. Many significant pirate services
use the aggregation of links to infringing content in order to operate and generate revenue. In
these circumstances the very act of linking – e.g., linking by someone whose object is to assist
in the infringement of copyright by systematically directing users to infringing copies –
should itself constitute an infringement of copyright.

The CJEU judgement in the Svensson case and other cases at national level indicate that a

12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?
The EU Copyright Directive already covers this issue. According to article 5.1 no
authorisation is required for temporary reproduction (A) for transmission by an intermediary
and (B) for lawful use. The right holders are therefore protected while legitimate internet
services are able unrestricted in providing their services.

4.         Download to own digital content
Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own).
Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner
(e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the
distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible
article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further
distribution of that tangible article)27. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can
also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution



27
     See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

                                                                                                14
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)28. This raises difficult questions,
notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers
keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as
the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of
a second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the
second-hand market for physical goods).

13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?
     YES – Please explain by giving examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

     NO
     NO OPINION
14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.
The resale of digital content (music) and physical products are two completely different uses.
They differ in that digital copies in contrast to physical copies do not deteriorate over time
due to use. “Digital exhaustion” and the resale of digital files also is a serious issue for the
music industry as it is impossible to ensure that the file sold is an original and legally
obtained file. It is also impossible to ensure that the sold digital file is deleted from the
seller’s digital library and is not resold again. “Digital Exhaustion” could potentially have a
severe effect on online music services as the right holders would not have any revenue from
the sale of the files which potentially could be an unlimited amount of illegally obtained files
offered to an unlimited amount of people and as a result have a negative impact in creating
new works for the benefit of users. The negative effect of digital resale is also stressed in the
U.S. Federal court decision in Capitol Records v. ReDigi from 2012.

C.        Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?
Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as the existing international treaties
in the area prohibit formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of rights.
However, this prohibition is not absolute29. Moreover a system of registration does not need
to be made compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and exercise of rights.
With a longer term of protection and with the increased opportunities that digital technology

28
   In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an author cannot oppose the resale of a second-
hand licence that allows downloading his computer program from his website and using it for an unlimited
period of time. The exclusive right of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such a licence is
exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus admitted that the distribution right may be subject to exhaustion in
case of computer programs offered for download with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer Programs Directive. It was stressed that this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to the Information Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51,
56).
29
    For example, it does not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works originating in the country imposing the
formalities as opposed to works originating in another country.

                                                                                                              15
provides for the use of content (including older works and works that otherwise would not
have been disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of registration are
increasingly being considered30.

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?
     YES
     NO
The creation of an EU registration system is unnecessary. A system imposed by legislation
carries significant risks for the market including additional administrative burdens, added
infrastructure and IT costs and potential conflict with existing market solutions.

D.         How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers
There are many private databases of works and other subject matter held by producers,
collective management organisations, and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater or lesser extent on the use of (more or less) interoperable, internationally agreed
‘identifiers’. Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a work, are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed31, and identify, variously, the work
itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are notable

30
   On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible online database is currently being
set up by the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
31
   E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to identify recordings, the International
Standard Book Number (ISBN) is used to identify books.

                                                                                                             16
examples of where industry is undertaking actions to improve the interoperability of such
identifiers and databases. The Global Repertoire Database32 should, once operational, provide
a single source of information on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33 was established to develop building blocks for the expression and
management of rights and licensing across all content and media types. It includes the
development of a Rights Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types
of rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34 is seeking to take such identification
systems a step further, and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing across
different sectors.

19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?
[Open question]
With regards to the current market the industry has adapted to meet the demands and provide
solutions which have created a functioning market.
The EU’s role – working closely with the industry and stakeholders – could be to engage in a
partnership where the industry and standard setting bodies when revising standards for
example the ISRC standard are aligned. Another area where a partnership is the Linked
Content Coalition (LCC framework http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org) where the
Commission has already been an important figure.

E.       Term of protection – is it appropriate?
Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for a limited period of time.
After the term of protection has expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be freely
used by anyone (in accordance with the applicable national rules on moral rights). The Berne
Convention35 requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the death of the author.
The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram producers, the term provided
for in the EU rules also extend 20 years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first publication. Performers and
producers in the audio-visual sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?
     YES – Please explain

The EU Term Extension Directive was adopted a short while ago and is now implemented in
the national states. A re-assessment regarding the length of protection (provided for sound
recordings) could be premature as the effects of the new legislation has not yet been seen. The
new term of protection (70 years) has brought the EU closer to the protection provided in
among others the United States (95 years) and reflects that performers need remuneration
later in life due to the prolonged life expectancy. Furthermore new services such as streaming
services are ensuring a prolonged life span of older works where these still gain revenue for
the benefit of the performers.
A long term of protection also has the positive effect that it is made possible to invest further
in new talent and promoting these which furthermore creates cultural diversity and more
choices for the end consumer.

 III.       Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market
Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other
protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain
purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract
from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number
of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC36.
Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international
law37. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and
exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interest of the rightholders.
Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no
other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level) 38, these limitations and
exceptions are often optional39, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national
legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of
the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member
States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is
worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework

computer programs, and Directive 92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.

and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential
effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect
only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions
to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State "A"
may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member
State "B")40.
The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair
compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other
instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation.
If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given
cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there
would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.
Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism
to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain
uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory
framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the
Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?
     YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
As mentioned in the above the limitations and exceptions are optional. They are also flexible
and have not been a problem when launching digital music services across Europe. Though
there is some variation in the exceptions in national law these have not been an issue. The
main exceptions are the same across the EU for example exceptions concerning press
quotation, education etc. Furthermore several exceptions do not have an effect on cross
boarder activities such as repair of equipment and architectural works etc.
     NO OPINION

22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


40
   Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and
related rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has been given a cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary work – for instance a novel – is considered an
orphan work in a Member State, that same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States and
can be used and accessed in all Member States.

                                                                                                           19
  YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain
Exceptions are derogations from the creator’s right and exceptions with regards to copyright
should as all other exceptions be interpreted and applied strictly. If some exceptions were to
be made mandatory – as with all changes in legislation – these changes should be based on
thorough examinations of the impacts of the exceptions. As mentioned above most exceptions
are implemented across the European Community and many of these have no effect on cross
border availability of online music services.
  NO OPINION


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.
Limitations and exceptions should be based on data evidencing a specific problem which
needs to be solved where the market has not already provided a solution and is not able to
solve.
The music industry has already provided solutions in many areas through licensing and other
means. An example of this is User Generated Content (UGC). UGC has been licensed by the
record companies for some time for the benefit of both user and the industry. The license
covers the users’ blogs, websites etc. Furthermore, the record companies have also facilitated
the licensing of small scale users. IFPI initiated a pan-European license scheme targeted at
small-scale-users such as small businesses, associations and individuals. The essence of the
scheme is to allow the small-scale-users to gain pan-European licenses (a one stop shop) for
using sound recordings on their websites.
It is not necessary to introduce a new exception as the market is already providing licenses
and solutions which allow users to use sound recordings while still ensuring revenue for the
right holders. In connection to this it should be noted that what may be a limited use today
could in the future potentially grow to a massive us in the future..

24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?
  YES – Please explain why
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
  NO – Please explain why
The exceptions provide flexibility in the legal system which allows more manoeuvrability and
allows the member states to implement these in national law when necessary based on
specific needs. However, more flexibility would create uncertainty with regards to the legal
system and would not create further harmonization in the European Community. In this
regards it must be stressed that an introduction of “fair-use” types of exception would create
a large degree of legal uncertainty and would go further than “certain limited uses”
described in the three-step-test. This test is the safety net of right holders and is as such also a

                                                                                                 20

25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation

Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the

27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)
If an act has an effect in more countries than one and the act is subject to compensation as
part of the exception then the compensation should be paid to the right holder in each country
where the harm is suffered corresponding to the harm suffered. The compensation should be
paid by the person benefitting from the exception in the country where the harm is suffered.

A.     Access to content in libraries and archives
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of
limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts



                                                                                            21
of preservation and archiving41 and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42. The public lending (under an exception or
limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is
governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives
envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At
the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal
exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to
rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different
stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

1.        Preservation and archiving
The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of
cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of
works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these
works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national
laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs
from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the
types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number
of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of
new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web
content) is often uncertain.
28.    (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to use an exception to preserve and archive specific works or other
subject matter in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems with the use by
libraries, educational establishments, museum or archives of the preservation exception?
     YES – Please explain, by Member State, sector, and the type of use in question.

29.       If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
If problems should exist the best and fastest solution would be to allow the market to find the
solution (such as a new licensing scheme). This would also ensure more flexibility as the
consumer habits evolve.

2.     Off-premises access to library collections
Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-
matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the
premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online
consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements
between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements
should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to
collections.
32.     (a) [In particular if you are an institutional user:] Have you experienced specific
problems when trying to negotiate agreements with rights holders that enable you to
provide remote access, including across borders, to your collections (or parts thereof) for
purposes of research and private study?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to consult, including across borders, works and other subject-matter held in
the collections of institutions such as universities and national libraries when you are not
on the premises of the institutions in question?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with
institutional users that enable those institutions to provide remote access, including across
borders, to the works or other subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research
and private study?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

33.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
The need for new exceptions and limitations does not exist. Should a problem arise in the
future this should be solved through a licensing scheme as this provides the fastest and most
flexible solution.
Furthermore, the access to music is already available across the European Community
through attractive models developed in the market. There exist free versions of streaming
services (freemium) and subscription services that the studying community have access to and
are able to study. Therefore there is no need for further exceptions within the field of music.

                                                                                            23
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


34.    If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions should be covered and under
which conditions?
As mentioned above in the response to question 33 there is no need for a legislative solution.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

35.       If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?
As mentioned above in the response to question 33 licensing is the best solution.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

3.        E – lending
Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes
also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it
technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content,
such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries
need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In
various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different
business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books
to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.
36.     (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to negotiate agreements to enable the electronic lending (e-lending), including
across borders, of books or other materials held in your collection?
(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced specific problems
when trying to borrow books or other materials electronically (e-lending), including across
borders, from institutions such as public libraries?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you negotiated agreements with libraries
to enable them to lend books or other materials electronically, including across borders?
     YES – Please explain with specific examples
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO
     NO OPINION
As music is already available across Europe through digital music services there is no need
for an exception with regards to e-lending.

Furthermore, unlicensed e-lending could interfere with the market which as mentioned above
as the e-lending services would be able to substitute the services provided by the market. This
would have an enormous negative economic impact on the industry and all the right holders.
E-lending should be licensed and not be covered by an exception.



                                                                                              24
37.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
 [Open question]
As mentioned in the above question an exception for e-lending music would harm the legal
market. If there problems should exit in the future it can only be solved by licensing.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3) and the previous one (n° 2).

38.    [In particular if you are an institutional user:] What differences do you see in the
management of physical and online collections, including providing access to your
subscribers? What problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

39.      [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference do you see between
libraries’ traditional activities such as on-premises consultation or public lending and
activities such as off-premises (online, at a distance) consultation and e-lending? What
problems have you encountered?
[Open question]
If libraries enter the market of making works available online the libraries would then
compete with business in the market and damaging the market. Therefore there should be no
exception or limitation regarding this.
……………………………………………………………………………………………….

4.      Mass digitisation
The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as
libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with
an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20 th century or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the
EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer
found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries
and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are
currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible

                                                                                                      25
effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)45.

40.      [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting to engage in mass
digitisation projects, a right holder, a collective management organisation:] Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU
(i.e. the agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-
border effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?
     YES – Please explain why and how it could best be achieved
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
This should be subject to voluntary implementation by the parties. There is no issue of out-of-
commerce recordings for the music industry. Moreover, the wide availability of music content
makes mass digitisation unnecessary.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION


41.     Would it be necessary to develop mechanisms, beyond those already agreed for
other types of content (e.g. for audio- or audio-visual collections, broadcasters’ archives)?
     YES – Please explain
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO – Please explain
There is no need for developing further mechanisms as the producers are able to license their
content directly.

B.       Teaching
Directive 2001/29/EC46 enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such
exceptions would typically allow a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his course,

45
   France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the effects of the MoU. The French act (LOI n°
2012-287 du 1er mars 2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees
collective management, unless the author or publisher in question opposes such management. The German act
(Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption of representation by a collecting society in relation to works
whose rightholders are not members of the collecting society.

                                                                                                             26
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper articles in the classroom or
by showing protected content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation from
the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementation at Member States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States providing instead a framework
for the licensing of content for certain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and study at home.

42.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject-matter for
illustration for teaching, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced specific problems
resulting from the way in which works or other subject-matter are used for illustration for
teaching, including across borders?

C.         Research
Directive 2001/29/EC47 enables Member States to choose whether to implement in their
national laws a limitation for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research. The open
formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level.

47.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or an institutional user:] Have you
experienced specific problems when trying to use works or other subject matter in the
context of research projects/activities, including across borders?

D.        Disabilities
Directive 2001/29/EC48 provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with
a disability. The open formulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different
implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with
disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union) 49.

The Marrakesh Treaty50 has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons
who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory
exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make
available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of
the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the
Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the
possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

50.    (a) [In particular if you are a person with a disability or an organisation representing
persons with disabilities:] Have you experienced problems with accessibility to content,
including across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of this exception?
(b) [In particular if you are an organisation providing services for persons with disabilities:]
Have you experienced problems when distributing/communicating works published in
special formats across the EU?

E.      Text and data mining
Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics51 are different terms used to describe
increasingly important techniques used in particular by researchers for the exploration of vast
amounts of existing texts and data (e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use
of software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant texts and data in
order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.
The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible on the internet or accessible
through subscriptions to e.g. journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g. on browser cache memories or
in computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual
analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or other subject matter, it is
necessary to obtain authorisation from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public without
restrictions on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered by the exception for
temporary copies in Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data
mining activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None of this is clear, in
particular since text and data mining does not consist only of a single method, but can be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as to whether the main
problems arising in relation to this issue go beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not
to obtain the authorisation to use content) and relate rather to the need to obtain “access” to
content (i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time, practical solutions to
facilitate text and data mining of subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52. In the context of these discussions,
other stakeholders argued that no additional licences should be required to mine material to
which access has been provided through a subscription agreement and considered that
a specific exception for text and data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.




51
  For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data mining” will be used.

F.      User-generated content
Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use and distribute
content at little to no financial cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called “user-generated content”. While users
can create totally original content, they can also take one or several pre-existing works,
change something in the work(s), and upload the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and
blogs53. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification of pre-existing works
even if the newly-generated/"uploaded" work does not necessarily require a creative effort
and results from merely adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with
other pre-existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such. However, the
development of social networking and social media sites that enable users to share content
widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities and increased the potential economic
impact for those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no longer the preserve of
a technically and artistically adept elite. With the possibilities offered by the new
technologies, re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises questions with regard to
fundamental rights such the freedom of expression and the right to property.
A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the framework of the "Licences for
Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was reached among participating stakeholders
on either the problems to be addressed or the results or even the definition of UGC.
Nevertheless, a wide range of views were presented as to the best way to respond to this
phenomenon. One view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in particular
non-commercial activities by individuals such as combining existing musical works with
videos, sequences of photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is needed: UGC
is flourishing, and licensing schemes are increasingly available (licence schemes concluded
between rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders
and the users generating the content. In any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated
content and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by rightholders across
different sectors as a result of the “Licences for Europe” discussions54.

58.     (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you experienced problems
when trying to use pre-existing works or other subject matter to disseminate new content on
the Internet, including across borders?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you experienced problems when users
publish/disseminate new content based on the pre-existing works or other subject-matter
through your service, including across borders?
(c) [In particular if you are a right holder:] Have you experienced problems resulting from
the way the users are using pre-existing works or other subject-matter to disseminate new
content on the Internet, including across borders?


53
   A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video (adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound
recording), or adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are “mash-ups” (blending two
sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in a blog.

The record labels have already launched a licensing scheme for UGC-content through digital
platforms. The license gives the users the possibility to post content on these platforms and
services without the users having to obtain an individual license. This scheme also ensures
revenue for the right holders including artists.
User Generated Content is in practice content based on already existing works which are
protected by copyright. UGC is generally a combination of the users own content combined
with the right holders content for example a video with a track by a recording artist.
UGC is not a minor phenomenon but a major share of the content available on the internet.
The record labels have provided a service such as youtube with a UGC-license which ensures
revenue for the right holders but also ensures that the consumers are able to create UGC
material. The revenue is created from the advertisements provided by the platforms in
connection to the UGC material which is the shared with the right holders. The license
scheme also allows for the users to embed the content whereby the users can post the content
on their own blogs and websites (although the content will still be made available from the
licensed platform).
The above market based solution has uses recognition technology which ensures that the
content used in the UGC can be identified whereby the right holders receive the remuneration
related to the content in question.
As shown above the market has provided a solution for the benefit of the industry as well as
the users.

61.    If there are problems, how would they best be solved?
[Open question]
As mentioned under question 59 this area is licensed through the platforms and a solution has
therefore already been provided, creating a legal environment for the consumers while still
ensuring revenue for the right holders.
………………………………………………………….
……………………………………………………………………………………………….


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?
[Open question]
As mentioned above UGC has been handled by licensing and has successfully created a
solution which benefits both consumers and right holders. Legislation in this area could
jeopardize the solution which is already in place. We therefore support the existing legal
system whereby the use of a right holders work – except for the already defined exceptions –
requires the permission of the right holder. The current legal framework has already laid the
grounds for the solution provided by the market and music industry.
From our view there are no concrete problems which can validate legislative change. New
legislation providing an exception for UGC would not benefit consumers as nothing would
change with regards to their use and the possibilities given to them but could however have a

                                                                                             34
negative effect on the right holders who could lose revenue. As previously mentioned UGC
material is not a minor phenomenon but a major share of the content available on the internet
and an exception in this area could have a major impact on the revenue stream of the right
holders as the use of UGC is still growing.

No different solution is needed as the market has already provided a solution for the benefit of
both consumers and right holders. As the solution is license based it is a flexible solution and
therefore ready to accommodate any demands that may become relevant in the future.

     IV.     Private copying and reprography
Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods typically used for such
purposes (blank media, recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening
devices such as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating rightholders
for the harm they suffer when copies are made without their authorisation by certain
categories of persons (i.e. natural persons making copies for their private use) or through use
of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.
With the constant developments in digital technology, the question arises as to whether the
copying of files by consumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g. when a
person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her
computer, her tablet and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the application of
private copying levies. It is argued that, in some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by
rightholders whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider already covers copies
made by the end user. This approach could potentially lead to instances of double payments
whereby levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees5657.
There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of levies to certain types of
cloud-based services such as personal lockers or personal video recorders.

64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions58 in the digital environment?

compensation. The only clarification needed that we are aware of concerns the issue of the
legal source and this issue will be clarified by the CJEU in the near future. Therefore there is
no need for further clarification in legislation.

65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?59
          – Please explain
The music industry prefers solutions based on licenses wherever possible. If the license
provided by the digital service does not include the private copying made by the consumers
there should be a levy for the harm occurring. However, if the license covers the private
copying there is no harm and no need for compensation. Harm suffered by the right holders
includes missed licensing opportunities and therefore there should be compensation when the
act of private copying is not licensed.

66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?
[Open question]
Levies on digital services – including services based in cloud technology – has had no impact
on the developing new services and does not interfere with the emerging services. This is of
course also due to licensing of these services for example iTunes Match, AmazonMP3 and
Googleplay. As mentioned above there is only a need for a private copying levy when there is

no effect as copying levies are only needed when it is not possible to license the copying.

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply different tariffs. This results in
obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services in the Single Market. At the same time,
many Member States continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private copying
levies to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product subject to a levy is
sold (e.g. private person or business). In that context, not all Member States have ex ante
exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these situations and
reduce the number of undue payments61.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?

payments. Please also indicate how a priori exemption and/or ex post reimbursement schemes
could help to remedy the situation.

Furthermore the CJEU case C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie vs. Opus Supplies clarified
that sales from one member state to consumers in another member state with private copying
levies makes the distance seller liable for the payment of the levy in the state where the
consumer is located (where the harm occurs). In our view export or exemption schemes can
also be applied in the case of online sales equipment and devices in order to avoid any double
payments.

products, type of transaction, stakeholders, etc.).
[Open question]
We do not have any data with regards to the percentage of products sold to persons other
than natural persons. It must however be noted that the private nature of a copy is not based
on the person buying the product but the actual use of the product. This can be assessed by
market studies.
Furthermore the national levy systems have systems with regards to exemptions or
reimbursements for certain categories of users, whereby undue payments are avoided.

     V.        Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights
and, in the case of performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration
rights. There are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from
authors or performers to producers62 or determining who the owner of the rights is when the
work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment contract63. This is an
area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different
sectors of the creative industries.
Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in
particular but not solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared along the whole value chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility to terminate
contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to
improve their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?
[Open question]
The producers have taken significant economic risks in an industry where there is no
guarantee of success. This is due to the grant of exclusive rights which is essential for taking
the economic risk. Moreover this exclusive right has given the producers a way to enforce
these rights against infringing parties for the benefit of all the right holders.
Contractual freedom continues to be the best solution for all parties involved in general but
also with regards to remuneration for the performers. A decline in revenue for the performers
is not due to the contracts between the parties but due to a general decline in revenue for the
music industry and the fact that the consumers have been given more freedom and choices
which has meant that the revenue received has had to be given to a larger group of
performers instead of a few as the consumers have a wider choice of what music they wish to
listen to. However, this has also meant that a performer has an income over a longer period
of time than before the digital services entered the market.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
           – Please explain why
Please see the response to question 72.
Both EU, national legislation and case law provide protection against unfair contractual
practices. Furthermore, the music industry is very competitive especially when it comes to
signing artists. This fact and the possibility of entering the market through digital production
and distribution even without a record label ensure that the companies apply fair practices in
their contracts when signing artists. If they did not do this a record label would cease to exist
as it would neither be able to sign new artists or be able to retain established artists.

……………………………………………………………………………………………….
     NO OPINION

74.    If you consider that the current rules are not effective, what would you suggest to
address the shortcomings you identify?
[Open question]
The current system guarantees contractual freedom which is the best means to achieve
fairness and fair contractual practices. Detailed rules interfering with the parties’ freedom to
contract or introducing artificial restrictions upon parties will not benefit anyone, as
ultimately, they would reduce the production of new creative content to the detriment of right
holders and consumers.

     VI.      Respect for rights
Directive 2004/48/EE64 provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights. The Commission has
consulted broadly on this text65. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its
provisions are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by
the dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other hand, there are concerns
about the current balance between enforcement of copyright and the protection of
fundamental rights, in particular the right for a private life and data protection. While it cannot
be contested that enforcement measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed
content is used for a commercial purpose66. One means to do this could be to clarify the role




64
   Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
65
   You will find more information on the following website:

   For example when the infringing content is offered on a website which gets advertising revenues that depend
on the volume of traffic.

                                                                                                           40
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67. At the same time, there could be clarification of
the safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for private users.

75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?
     YES – Please explain
Unlicensed services are a big and unfair competitor when launching a service and harm the
industry. The enforcement directive 2004/48/EC provides protection but has not been able to
adjust to the new digital reality. Online infringements of copyright are the most common and
most damaging form of infringement and there is therefore a great need for efficient and fast
enforcement when infringements are discovered. A revision of directive 2004/48/EC is
therefore needed.
In relation to this, some member states have not implemented directive 2001/29/EC correctly.
An example of this is article 8 (3). In Denmark it is possible for the right holder to obtain an
injunction against an internet service provider in other countries this is not the case. In
connection to this it must be noted that the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice
has confirmed that this form of injunction is possible under Article 8 (3) and is not
incompatible with fundamental rights.
Furthermore, cross-border injunctions should be introduced. Online infringements and piracy
is in its nature a cross border activity where the site and service is available in more than one
country. The right holders will often have to initiate multiple actions against the infringing
service as there is currently no procedure to enable claims in different countries to be
consolidated in one jurisdiction. This could be remedied by allowing an injunction in one
territory to be enforced in another member state (with regards to the same specific service) or
by way of expedited procedure.
In connection to this the provisions on injunctive relief should be improved in order to cover
subsequent IP/DNS addresses of infringing websites and catalogue-wide injunctive relief.
An example of the problem above is The Pirate Bay which has changed domain names and
registrations and IP addresses several times in order to avoid injunctions in the countries
where these have been obtained. The rights holders should be able to notify of new IP-
addresses and URLs to ISPs when an infringing site changes these (if an injunction case
against the service has already been concluded). It should also be possible to obtain a
catalogue-wide injunctive relief for current and future catalogue. This should not be rendered
unreasonably onerous or practically unworkable due to the number of infringements that
must be proved by a right holder in order to obtain such relief. In addition, where injunctions
are granted and the service is hosted by an EU based ISP that ISP should be required to
terminate the hosting account.

  This clarification should not affect the liability regime of intermediary service providers established by
Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

                                                                                                         41
  NO OPINION

76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?
[Open question]
There is room for improvement with regards to allowing for sufficient involvement of
intermediaries. The recording industry believes that all intermediaries including those
mentioned in the question above share a common responsibility to cooperate and support
legitimate legal digital commerce and fight piracy. Measures which could foster cooperation
includes a framework where the following is ensured i) search engines should not facilitate
access to infringing content and websites ii) advertisers and ad-networks should stop serving
advertisements to infringing sites that make substantial sums from unlicensed content; (iii)
payment providers should be required to stop providing payment services to illegal sites and
services; and (iv) App stores should remove Apps which are designed to facilitate piracy.
In connection to the above it is of outmost importance that only truly neutral intermediaries
should be protected from liability under the E-commerce safe harbours. The rights holders
often encounter problems with regards to notice and take action procedures as many
platforms speculate and take advantage of the safe harbour in the E-commerce directives
article 14. The services are not properly within the definition of hosting service providers, nor
are they true intermediaries (e.g. unlicensed locker services and BitTorrent sites). Many of
these services are structurally infringing sites, enabling the wide dissemination of
unauthorised content, and whose business model depends on right holders not being able to
locate and notify infringing URLs fast enough before they are re-posted. However, according
to ECJ case law and the EU legislative framework, protection against liability can only
granted to “merely technical, automatic and passive” services. This should therefore be
clarified further.
An important tool when enforcing the copyright of the right holders is to be able to identify
the infringer. We recommend a framework ensuring reliable information in public databases
such as Domain Tools and RIPE. If these databases are incorrect or not up to date it is very
difficult to enforce the rights of the right holders.

77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?

Promusicae case – ensures a correct balance between copyright and other rights.

   VII. A single EU Copyright Title
The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been present in the copyright debate
for quite some time now, although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unified EU Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of
copyright law in the EU and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only manner in which a truly
Single Market for content protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe that the
same objective can better be achieved by establishing a higher level of harmonisation while
allowing for a certain degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?
  YES
  NO
  NO OPINION
There are no benefits from a single EU Copyright title and it is difficult to see how this should
be put into practice.
A single EU title is better suited with respect to rights which are obtained through
registration such as trademarks and patents in contrast to copyright which is not. With
regards to registration of rights there is an advantage in a single European title as this
provides an alternative to multiple registration an in individual member states. A single
European copyright title would not have this benefit.
A single European copyright title as an option on top of national legislation would not make
sense as this would probably not be adopted (because of the duplicated protection). A
mandatory title would require full harmonization. In our view this is neither necessary nor
achievable.
Furthermore, a single European copyright title would prove inflexible and could hamper
future developments in the market.
Finally the work with creating a single EU copyright title would take away focus and much
needed resources from other areas such as enforcement.


79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?
[Open question]
The music industry is mainly based in the legal framework provided in directive 2001/29/EC
which outlines the necessary rights and the protection of technology in the digital

                                                                                              43
environment is generally satisfactory and sufficiently harmonized at EU level. The directive
both legal certainty as well as flexibility which is vital for a field such as copyright which is
so closely linked to the advances in technology.
As mentioned in question 78 the resources put into a new single EU copyright title would be
better used in ensuring proper implementation and enforcement of the existing framework.

VIII.     Other issues
The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on the most important
matters relating to the current EU legal framework for copyright. Should any important
matters have been omitted, we would appreciate if you could bring them to our attention, so
they can be properly addressed in the future.

80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.
[Open question]
One area in which the EU could have an immediate and positive impact on the copyright
sectors would be to introduce a system of tax credits to assist with the discovery, development
and production costs of new artists. A tax credit system would incentivise companies to take
additional risks on new European talent, would boost cultural diversity, and lead to more
investment in talent at a local level, all the while boosting the European economy.


Another important issue is to extend reduced VAT rates for the cultural sectors to cover
recorded music, which currently does not benefit from the reduced rates that other sectors do.
Additionally, extending the reduced VAT rates to both online and offline products is
important, as the product consumed is the same: music. Reduced and harmonised VAT rates
would lead to more consumer interest in purchasing music (at lower prices) and would be a
way of promoting Europe’s culture. It would also bring the music sector in line with other
creative and cultural sectors.
