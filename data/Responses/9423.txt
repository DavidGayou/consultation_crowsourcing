   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


   1. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      problems when trying to access online services in an EU  Member  State
      other than the one in which you live?


€ YES - Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content such  as  certain  films
and TV series, audio-visual content in general, music,  e-books,  magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other software)

☒NO


There are many national offers which satisfy the current  demand,  including
some services available across  borders.  A  list  of  the  legal  offer  in
Belgium can be found on our website: http://www.belgianentertainment.be.


The  current  copyright  system  provides  no  legal  barriers  to  offering
services  covering  several  territories.   But  many  elements  other  than
copyright play a role in the degree of  development  of  online  audiovisual
services  and  their  availability  in  different  Member  States:  relevant
hardware penetration, broadband infrastructure and speed,  taxation,  micro-
payment facilities, rules  on  protection  of  consumers  and  minors.   The
degree of availability  of  illegal  content  and  services  also  plays  an
important role in the  development  of  a  strong,  sustainable  audiovisual
online offer.


Empirical observations of the companies active in our  sector  (often  SMEs)
suggest that the obstacles to  developing  an  EU-wide  presence  have  very
little to do with legal infrastructure. Rather, these obstacles are  due  to
the rich cultural and linguistic diversity  of  Europe  and  the  particular
economic model dictated by a European market made up of multiple  languages,
cultures, local tastes and societal  preoccupations.   In  addition,  strong
regional  differences  in  terms  of  broadband  infrastructure,  speed  and
preferred payment systems create further barriers which  any  market  player
would need to overcome in order to build a successful  EU-wide  presence  in
the online environment.


Film and audiovisual content is fundamentally different from other types  of
creative content, both from a  consumer  perspective  and  from  a  business
perspective.   It  is  well  documented  that  the  consumption  pattern  of
audiovisual content online in any national European  culture  today  broadly
replicates the  patterns  seen  with  legacy  media  such  as  cinema,  home
entertainment on digital media  and  linear  television:  roughly  speaking,
consumer preference is for  national  content  first,  international  non-EU
blockbusters second, and anything  else  third,  including  non-national  EU
content.


In addition, a full understanding of the interlinked business  relationships
which underpin the European audiovisual  industry’s  financing,  production,
marketing and distribution practices  is  critical  to  the  development  of
appropriate future policies  and  legislation  in  this  area.  Unlike  many
manufactured goods, film escapes standardization and each film is  a  unique
work, a prototype – each film  has  its  own  business  model  in  terms  of
financing, production, marketing and distribution to audiences.   Given  the
level of financial investment required in film and  audiovisual  production,
marketing and distribution, most  European  audiovisual  producers  seek  to
share, or outsource, the financial risk  involved  in  film  production  and
distribution.  This is often done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by
platform, language and/or territory to  entities  specialised  in  marketing
and distributing audiovisual content in the  various  exploitation  channels
and countries.  This system serves as an elaborate  form  of  “peer-review”,
and investment partners are  attracted  by  the  sheer  creative  force  and
commercial potential of the audiovisual  project.   Indeed,  in  many  cases
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting  of  the
film.


European films often find it difficult to  find  an  audience  beyond  their
national market and  therefore  require  local,  specialized  marketing  and
distribution efforts tailored  to  the  specific  distribution  channel  and
targeted foreign audience in order to attract attention.


Our  members  are  increasingly  pursuing  new  opportunities  presented  by
technological developments and convergence, be it  by  offering  audiovisual
works online directly to end users or in  cooperation  with  third  parties.
These services are bringing greater choice to consumers, both  in  terms  of
content on offer and in the variety of platforms  and  ways  to  access  and
consume audiovisual content. We  are  seeing  rapid  growth  in  the  online
market for audiovisual works in Europe, with consumer  spending  on  digital
online video increasing by a  phenomenal  97.1%  in  2012  compared  to  the
previous  year.  Given  the  challenging  economic  circumstances  for   the
European audiovisual sector, these new revenue streams are clearly  welcome.
However, the gains in revenue from digital online video are not yet able  to
compensate for the continued reduction in revenue from  the  physical  video
market.  Annual consumer spending on physical video  is  estimated  to  have
contracted by over €3600m compared to pre-crisis  levels,  whereas  European
consumer spending on digital online video amounted to  just  a  fraction  of
this in 2012, at €673.7m.  These fluctuations in revenue streams affect  our
members’ capacity  to  finance,  produce  and  disseminate  new  audiovisual
content: less funds are available to pre-purchase  future  video  publishing
rights (offline and online) prior to the actual making  of  the  film,  thus
affecting producers’ ability to close production budgets. There  is  also  a
negative effect on revenues flowing back into production,  distribution  and
publishing activities.  The adverse impact of these developments is  further
reinforced by infringement of our members’ rights both in the  physical  and
in the online environment.


Our members do not consider online distribution of  audiovisual  content  to
be merely a potential  future  revenue  stream  or  as  a  way  to  amortize
investments.  They are  increasingly  looking  to  new  online  distribution
channels to contribute to the advance financing  of  films  and  audiovisual
content in a manner similar to that already  provided  by  the  pre-sale  of
rights  to  theatrical,  home  entertainment  and  television   distribution
channels.   In  other  words,  they  are  looking  to  online   distribution
platforms and services  to  share  in  the  financial  risk  of  production,
marketing and distribution.  This is  a  strategic  necessity  in  order  to
ensure that the widest possible choice in terms  of  platforms,  titles  and
price points is offered to consumers.


Our  members  continue  to  invest  in  and  experiment  with   the   online
distribution of audiovisual content.  At present, many  different  varieties
of  models,  content  and  delivery  modes  are  being  explored  by  market
operators in the European Union and it remains to be  seen  which  modes  of
consumption will be favored by consumers going forward.


€ NO OPINION





   2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems
      when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


€ YES - Please explain  whether  such  problems,  in  your  experience,  are
related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.  business  decisions  relating
to the cost of providing services  across  borders,  compliance  with  other
laws such as consumer protection)? Please provide  examples  indicating  the
Member State, the sector and the type of  content  concerned  (e.g.  premium
content such as  certain  films  and  TV  series,  audio-visual  content  in
general,  music,  e-books,  magazines,  journals  and   newspapers,   games,
applications and other software).


☒NO


The issue is one of lack of actual, sustainable consumer  demand  for  cross
border  services.   Consumer  demand  focuses  on  access  to  content,  not
platforms.  At present, commercial demand for  licences  to  provide  online
services across borders is negligible.  Platforms and aggregators appear  to
focus on national or regional markets, assessing these to be  the  pertinent
markets, at least at this stage of market development.


€ NO OPINION





   3. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] How often are  you  asked  to  grant  multi-territorial
      licences? Please indicate, if possible, the  number  of  requests  per
      year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector  and
      the type of content concerned.


[Open question]


Actual demand for cross-border or multi-territorial  licenses  is  extremely
limited  at  this  stage,  especially   outside   linguistically   connected
countries/regions.   Successful  online  licensing   and   distribution   of
audiovisual content depends on offering a wide range of  attractive  content
in a manner which is linguistically relevant and  culturally  attractive  to
local audiences.  Thus, platforms  and  aggregators  focus  on  national  or
regional markets, assessing these to be the pertinent markets, at  least  at
this stage of market development.





   4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions
      above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


 [Open question]


The  market  is  capable  of  developing  solutions  to  meeting  sustained,
demonstrable consumer demand for specific services.





   5. [In particular if you are a right holder or  a  collective  management
      organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all
      the necessary rights for all the territories in  question,  you  would
      still  find  it  necessary  or   justified   to   impose   territorial
      restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to  ensure
      that access to certain content is not  possible  in  certain  European
      countries)?


☒YES – Please explain by giving examples


There are objective reasons for territorial licensing.  First and  foremost,
this is the most efficient way  to  respond  to  local  demand  which  tends
towards national  content  first  and  non-EU  and/or  non-national  content
second, with language  playing  a  significant  role.   Second,  market  and
regulatory conditions  vary  from  country  to  country,  de-facto  imposing
territorial licensing  in  certain  circumstances.   In  addition,  European
audiovisual content is predominantly financed, produced and disseminated  in
models  of  joint  ventures  (co-productions)  and/or  risk-sharing  between
partners from different distribution platforms and/or territories.


Unlike many manufactured goods, film escapes standardization and  each  film
is a unique work, a prototype – each film has  its  own  business  model  in
terms of  financing,  production  and  distribution.   Given  the  level  of
financial investment required in film and audiovisual production,  marketing
and distribution, most European  audiovisual  entities  seek  to  share,  or
outsource, the financial risk involved in film production and  distribution.
 This  is  often  done  by  pre-selling  distribution  rights  by  platform,
language  and/or  territory  to  entities  specialized  in   marketing   and
distributing audiovisual content in the various  exploitation  channels  and
countries.  This system serves as an elaborate form  of  “peer-review”,  and
investment  partners  are  attracted  by  the  sheer  creative   force   and
commercial potential of the audiovisual project.   Indeed,  in  many  cases,
this process takes place even before the actual production/shooting  of  the
film.


There is currently no other way in which the  required  level  of  financing
can be raised in the marketplace.

      Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired  all  the

      find it necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on

   7. Do you think that further measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
      including market-led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the
      cross-border availability of content services in  the  Single  Market,
      while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


€ YES – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO – Please explain


In  the  absence  of  evidence  of  market  failure,  there  should  be   no
legislative or policy intervention in the audiovisual industry’s  commercial
and contractual  freedom  with  regard  to  territoriality  and  exclusivity
provisions.  Imposed business  models  and  distribution  practices  do  not
promote a sustainable audiovisual industry.  The industry needs to  be  able
to adapt – without legislative intervention –  to  changing  commercial  and
market conditions.  Where there is  demonstrable  and  sustainable  consumer
demand, the market will respond.


European films often find it difficult to  find  an  audience  beyond  their
national market and  therefore  require  local,  specialized  marketing  and
distribution efforts tailored  to  the  specific  distribution  channel  and
targeted foreign audience. The current copyright system  provides  no  legal
barriers to  offering  services  covering  several  territories.   But  many
elements other than copyright play a role in the degree  of  development  of
online audiovisual services  and  their  availability  in  different  Member
States: relevant hardware penetration, broadband infrastructure  and  speed,
taxation, micro-payment facilities, rules on  protection  of  consumers  and
minors.  The degree of availability of illegal  content  and  services  also
plays an  important  role  in  the  development  of  a  strong,  sustainable

Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


   8.  Is  the  scope  of  the  “making  available”  right  in  cross-border
      situations – i.e.  when  content  is  disseminated  across  borders  –
      sufficiently clear?


☒YES


The exclusive right of “making available” extends to  the  offering  to  the
public of a work for individualized streaming or downloading as well as  the
actual transmission of a work to members of the public – from  a  place  and
at a time individually chosen by them, irrespective of the  technical  means
used for making available. The very nature of  the  making  available  right
for copyright works is such that it takes place both  where  it  is  offered
and where  it  is  capable  of  being  accessed  by  consumers.  This  is  a
reflection of the interactive nature of the right. This is crucial  both  to
the licensing of content but also to  determining  the  jurisdiction  and/or
the applicable law  for  right  holders  to  enforce  their  rights  against
infringers and online intermediaries.


The scope of the  making  available  right  in  cross-border  situations  is
sufficiently clear.  In fact, our  members  rely  on  the  making  available
right on a daily basis as a tool for licensing their content  on  the  basis
of different distribution channels, linguistic  versions,  etc.   They  also
rely on the making available right to enforce their rights online.


Any approach to the making available right  that  would  artificially  alter
the inherent interactive nature of this right  would  risk  undermining  its
utility as a licensing and enforcement tool.  Indeed, a limitation, such  as
through the so-called “country of origin” approach, of  the  scope  of  this
exclusive right would seriously diminish its value and therefore  amount  to
an expropriation of a valuable property right  protected  as  a  fundamental
right by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as well  as
international copyright treaties.


Finally, any limitation on the exercise of exclusive rights must  also  meet
the conditions enshrined in the three-step step  pursuant  to  international
copyright treaties and the Copyright Directive.


€ NO – Please  explain  how  this  could  be  clarified  and  what  type  of
clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"  approach  explained
above, as in "country of origin" approach[23])

   9. [In particular if you are a right holder:]  Could  a clarification  of
      the territorial scope of the “making available” right have  an  effect
      on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered  to
      be an author or not, whether you are considered  to  have  transferred
      your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on  the  enforcement  of
      rights (including the availability of injunctive relief[24])?


☒YES – Please explain how such potential effects could be addressed


As noted above, a  “clarification”  limiting  the  scope  of  the  exclusive
making available right is neither necessary nor justified.


In the audiovisual sector, the rights  necessary  to  finance,  produce  and
exploit a film or TV programme are generally consolidated with the  producer
– the question of who is considered to be among the authors of the  film  as
well as how remuneration is organised is dealt with by national  law  and/or
practices.  The exercising of the making  available  right  does  not  raise
issues in this connection.  However, it is  crucial  that  the  producer  be
able – through commercial and contractual freedom – to manage and  authorise
the distribution of the work concerned, including the  distribution  channel
and the territorial scope of the rights  licensed,  in  the  optimal  manner
both in terms of the exploitation  of  the  work  itself  and  also  to  the
benefit of all right  holders  in  the  collaborative  work.   As  mentioned
above, this  commercial  and  contractual  freedom  is  fundamental  to  the
European film industry’s financing model.  European  film  makers,  be  they
producers or authors, need to secure financing prior to the shooting of  the
actual film.


The contractual freedom to organize the financing  and  future  distribution
of each film in  accordance  with  its  specific  business  model  makes  it
possible to finance European films and ensure their best possible  promotion
to the future audience in each individual market.


As regards enforcement, a  “country  of  origin”  approach  could  seriously
hamper right holders’ ability to take legal action to  address  structurally
infringing websites which are based in other Member  States  or  outside  of
the EU itself (note that the operators of such sites are  usually  anonymous
and thus cannot be identified or located).  As a  result,  legal  action  in
the form of proceedings for  injunctive  relief  is  generally  directed  at
intermediaries based on Article 8(3) of the Copyright Directive.  There  are
two important conditions which must be fulfilled before a  court  will  have
jurisdiction to rule under this provision (1) the subject of  the  order  is
an intermediary (a very broad notion which includes access  providers);  and
(2) a third party uses the  intermediary’s  service  to  infringe.   Once  a
court has established that these criteria are met,  it  will  then  consider
issues  related  to  proportionality,  freedom  of  expression   and   other
fundamental rights.


Article 8(3) has become a crucial tool for right  holders  to  fight  online
copyright infringements – particularly due to  the  fact  that  structurally
infringing sites rarely operate openly in the EU (see the AG Opinion in  the
kino.to case). With respect to peer-to-peer sites, the nature of such  sites
is that the access provider’s subscribers (end-users) will use its  services
to infringe (since they are uploading and  downloading  infringing  content)
and the structurally-infringing peer-to-peer site, which will  be  operating
offshore and anonymously, will also be using the access  provider’s  service
to infringe (since it is  making  available  infringing  content).   If  the
making available  right  were  to  be  subject  to  the  country  of  origin
doctrine, it could be difficult to  show  that  the  website  is  infringing
copyright in another country where  the  injunction  is  sought  –  but  the
damage is nevertheless significant –  and therefore meets the  above  stated
condition, i.e. that  the  site  is  using  the  intermediary’s  service  to
infringe.   While  action  could  still  be  based   on   the   subscriber’s
infringements, right holders would find their options and scope  for  action
against infringing activities seriously limited.


As regards streaming sites, it would become  much  more  difficult  to  show
that the end user is infringing (right holders would have  to  invoke  their
reproduction right  and  issues  related  to  the  possible  exceptions  for
temporary and private copies would arise – both issues are currently  before
the CJEU.  The potential impact of a  limitation  on  the  making  available
right is thus more pronounced.

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


  10. [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does  the
      application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation  in
      the online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


€ YES – Please explain what type of measures would be needed in order to
address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights
are in different hands, legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights")


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO


It is not unusual for a single act of economic exploitation to involve
several rights.


On-demand services generally implicate the making available right and the
reproduction right. The reproduction right enters into play where platforms
need to make copies to offer the protected content to the public
(upstream), copies made on services and on users’ devices as well as where
the platform’s service involves the licensing of subsequent permanent
copies to consumers (downstream).  Several rights are involved in
individual models does not cause problems.  This is also the case in the
off-line environment and has not caused problems for our members who often
act both as licensors of film/TV content and licensees of music used in the
film (where applicable).


Any legislative intervention which would limit the scope of the making
available and/or reproduction rights and thereby hinder the ability of
audiovisual right holders to license their works would raise issues with
the EU’s obligations under international copyright norms.

Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[25]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[26] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

  11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject
      matter protected under copyright, either in general or under  specific
      circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


☒YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


EU copyright legislation and jurisprudence generally provides the  requisite
clarity on the matter of linking and browsing.  National  courts  have  made
important contributions to the understanding of  the  communication  to  the
public right.  The CJEU has also recently provided clarification on  several
important fact  patterns.   The  importance  that  hyperlinking  plays  with
regard to  content  delivery  online  means  that  a  broad  exclusion  from
copyright protection would not  only  undermine  basic  licensing  practices
online but it would also seriously hinder the ability of  right  holders  to
fight copyright infringements online.


Question 11 is somewhat unclear and the answer depends to a large extent  on
whether the provider of the link performs a material  intervention  to  make
the content available  to  a  new  audience.   The  parameters  are  already
largely defined by CJEU judgements and  this  already  substantial  body  of
case law has been further clarified  by  way  of  the  Svensson  case.   Two
further decisions are expected in 2014 (BestWater International and  C  More
Entertainment).


Further legislative action is not needed in this area. It is vital that  the
courts retain the possibility to respond to specific fact patterns. In  this
area, any legislation attempting to establish specific or  inflexible  rules
for when a particular technical operation online amounts to a  communication
to the public risks being outdated quickly and could remove the ability  for
the courts to consider the specific circumstances  of  a  given  case.   The
complexities  and   constantly   evolving   nature   of   online   copyright
infringement are  such  that  this  could  have  the  unintended  effect  of
hindering enforcement efforts – or indeed certain forms of  licensing  which
operate by means of linking.


€ NO – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g. because it  does  not  amount
to an act of communication to the public – or to a new  public,  or  because
it should be covered by a copyright exception)

  12. Should the viewing of a web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary

      subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?


☒YES – Please explain whether you consider this to be the case  in  general,
or under specific circumstances, and why


For reasons similar to  those  stated  above  in  the  context  of  linking,
current legislation and Courts can provide  sufficient  clarity  to  address
cases arising  from  specific  circumstances.   As  a  general  matter,  the
exclusive right of reproduction extends  to  temporary  reproductions.   The
courts should retain the possibility to consider specific  circumstances  to
determine for example whether or not the  exception  for  certain  temporary
copies in Article 5(1) is applicable.  There may be cases where  the  copies
on the screen or in the cache memory are  fully  covered  by  Article  5(1).
However, in the event those  copies  are  made  from  illegal  sources,  the
exception may not apply.  This can be crucial to the application of  Article
8(3) – it is crucial not to immunise infringing sites from  potential  legal
action on the basis that their users are not  infringing  copyright  –  even
though the site is clearly making available infringing copies  of  protected
works.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[27].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[28].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).

  13. [In particular if you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]  Have  you  faced
      restrictions when  trying  to  resell  digital  files  that  you  have
      purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


€ YES – Please explain by giving examples


☒NO


The EU doctrine of exhaustion of rights is well established  in  legislation
and jurisprudence – Article 3.3 of the  Copyright  Directive  provides  that
the communication  to  the  public  and  making  available  rights  are  not
exhausted.  Thus, the direction of the question  is  somewhat  unclear:  the
acts listed in the question are not authorised by legislation.


Licensing terms  governing  on-demand  transactions,  based  on  the  making
available right and agreed contractual terms, that grant  usage  rights  and
prohibit the resale of digital files – particularly where  the  consumer  is
made aware of these terms in advance before purchase – are  transparent  and
necessary to sustain such business models.


There is an important link between the making available  right  and  Article
6(4)(4) of the Copyright Directive.  Where  a  work  is  made  available  on
demand on agreed contractual terms, Member States cannot intervene to  limit
– including  exhaust  –  the  exclusive  right.   In  the  absence  of  this
provision, many business models  would  not  be  sustainable.   The  current
legal  framework  is  an  enabler  of  multiple  online   business   models,
specifically designed to the  online  environment,  including  the  economic
viability of offering films in this distribution channel.

  14. [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:]  What
      would be the consequences of providing a legal framework enabling  the
      resale of previously purchased digital  content?  Please  specify  per
      market (type of content) concerned.


[Open question]


The EU doctrine of exhaustion of rights is well established  in  legislation
and jurisprudence and has played an important role  in  the  development  of
the single market with  regard  to  tangible  copies  and  the  distribution
right. While the  CJEU  has  provided  some  further  clarification  in  the
UsedSoft and TV Catchup  decisions,  the  concept  of  “digital  exhaustion”
presents radically different issues that go well beyond tangible copies  and
the  distribution  right.   Instead,  both  the  reproduction   and   making
available rights are at issue, none  of  which  are  subject  of  exhaustion
under EU law. The ruling in UsedSoft cannot be extended directly  to  making
available of works other than computer programs, since it was  issued  under
the Computer Programs Directive.  Moreover,  Usedsoft  “cannot  remedy  that
there is no exhaustion  of  the  reproduction  right”.  Providing  otherwise
would  raise  serious  issues  under   international   copyright   treaties,
including the tree-step test.


There is an important link between the making available  right  and  Article
6(4) of the Copyright Directive. Where a work is made  available  on  demand
on agreed contractual terms, Member  States  cannot  intervene  to  limit  –
including exhaust – the exclusive right. In the absence of  this  provision,
many business models would not be sustainable. The current  legal  framework
is an enabler of multiple online business models, specifically  designed  to
the online environment, including the economic viability of  offering  films
in this distribution channel.


If the online market place is  to  thrive,  right  holders  must  retain  an
ability to manage new  business  models  based  on  creative  licensing  and
innovative new offers. Despite good faith intentions, it is not possible  to
verify and/or manage transfers of digital  content.  A  regime  of  “digital
exhaustion” based on a concept of “forward  and  delete”  is  unworkable  in
practice. Indeed, digital exhaustion has no place in an environment that  is
increasingly based on licensing access to protected works  and  cloud  based
services.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[29]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[30].


  15. Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the
      identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


€ YES


☒NO


Considerable  progress  has  been  achieved   by   industry   and   relevant
stakeholders in  the  development  of  publicly  accessible  registries  and
databases of information about  works,  authors/related  right  holders  and
other data that make it significantly faster, cheaper and easier  accurately
to identify right holders in a wide range of works. A number of  initiatives
focus specifically on the audiovisual sector.  Two main  identifier  systems
are currently used in the audiovisual sector: the ISO-labeled  International
Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN  –  www.isan.org)  and  the  Entertainment
Identifier Registry (EIDR – www.eidr.org).  Thus, there is already  advanced
and  constructive  efforts  across  the   audiovisual   sector   in   making
information about the identity and contact points  for  right  holders  more
broadly and expeditiously available, and in facilitating identification  and
licensing of works in the digital environment.


In the audiovisual sector, the centralization of rights  with  the  producer
means that there is  less  demand  for  the  creation  of  a  repository  of
ownership  and  license  information  compared  to  some   other   copyright
industries.  In any event, any  registration  system  and/or  database  must
remain voluntary, both for practical reasons and in  order  to  be  in  line
with international norms.


€ NO OPINION





  16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


[Open question]


An EU level registration system could not provide advantages over and  above
current  audiovisual  industry  efforts  in  the   field   of   identifiers.
Irrespective of the nature of  registration  systems,  they  must  be  cost-
effective, robust and secure, subject to being  constantly  updated,  deploy
state of the art  technology  and  have  effective  anti-fraud  measures  in
place.





  17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


[Open question]


In the absence of robust fraud detection and a means of constantly  updating
information to ensure its accuracy and legitimacy, registration systems  can
be used to infringe or misappropriate rights or simply mislead.





  18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


[Open question]


Any incentives to right holders would have to flow  from  benefits  inherent
in the registration system itself.  Incentives linked to  protection  and/or
enforcement of rights will not be compatible  with  international  copyright
norms.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[31], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[32]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[33]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[34] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


  19. What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the  adoption
      of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the development
      and interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


[Open question]


Two main identifier systems are currently used in  the  audiovisual  sector:
the  ISO-labeled  International  Standard   Audiovisual   Number   (ISAN   –
www.isan.org)  and   the   Entertainment   Identifier   Registry   (EIDR   –
www.eidr.org).


We appreciate the efforts of the European Commission in  promoting  a  joint
declaration  on  the  role  of  identifiers  and  the  inherent   value   of
interoperability between the two identifiers.   This  declaration  has  been
discussed and adopted within  the  framework  of  the  Stakeholder  Dialogue
Licenses for Europe. It is a strong signal from the  industry  concerned  to
promote  further  dissemination  of  the  use  of  identifiers  as  well  as
interoperability between the two main identifiers.


The role of the EU should be  to  continue  to  facilitate  discussions  and
encourage marketplace solutions to  interoperability  as  suggested  by  the
declaration.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[35]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

  20. Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the
      digital environment?

☒YES – Please explain


We see no reason why terms of copyright protection should  be  different  in
the digital environment.  Irrespective of  whether  the  copyright  work  is
produced for and disseminated in the analogue or  the  digital  environment,
the costs of developing, creating,  producing,  marketing  and  distributing
the work are such that an adequate period of time is required to recoup  the
investment.   Creative  contributors’  efforts  are  the  same  as  are  the
economic risks involved in the production, marketing  and  dissemination  of
the protected work.


The current terms of protection are appropriate.  We oppose  any  initiative
to shorten or even modify terms of protection.   Such  efforts  would  raise
serious issues under the EU  Charter  on  Fundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms
where the right to private property, as well as the right to  protection  of
intellectual property (Art. 17), is guaranteed.


At the time  of  the  adoption  of  the  Directive  extending  the  term  of
protection for the related rights of  music  performers  and  producers,  we
were opposed to  a  similar  initiative  in  the  audiovisual  sector.  This
remains our position.  At the time, the Commission's impact  assessment  had
not considered the audiovisual sector, even  in  passing.   It  acknowledged
that the two sectors are fundamentally different and  respond  to  different

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[36].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[37].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[38], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[39],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[40].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.

  21. Are there problems arising from the fact  that  most  limitations  and
      exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives  are  optional  for
      the Member States?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO – Please explain


The Copyright Directive sets forth an exhaustive list of  twenty  exceptions
and  limitations.   The  current  regime  of  one  mandatory  and  otherwise
optional  exceptions  allows  for  a  flexible  and  proportionate  use   of
protected works and an adequate degree of harmonization has  been  achieved.
This legislative approach of optional exceptions with some scope for  Member
State  flexibility  in  the  national  implementation  is  the   appropriate
legislative  choice  in  a  time  of  rapid  technological  development  and
everyday launch of new models for distribution of protected content  online.
 This approach is also in line with the principle of subsidiarity.   We  are
not aware of any practical problems that have arisen  with  respect  to  the
optional nature of the exhaustive list of exceptions.


With  the  current  options,  EU  Member  States  may,  in  line  with   the
subsidiarity  principle,   decide   themselves   which   limitation   and/or
exceptions they believe are  best  suited  to  serve  the  public  interest,
foster economic growth and preserve cultural heritage and diversity.


At the same time, a significant degree  of  convergence  between  the  legal
systems  of  the  Member  States  has  developed  due  to  EU   legislation.
Moreover, the CJEU  plays  an  important  clarifying  role  by  providing  a
uniform interpretation of exceptions.  The  application  of  the  three-step
test is a key element in ensuring that a fair balance  is  achieved  between
users’ interests and right holders’ exclusive rights.

  22. Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
      there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain by referring to specific cases


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO – Please explain


See Question 21. The current structure offers flexibility and represents  an
effective working  compromise.  If  limitations  and  exceptions  were  made
mandatory, many Member States which do not provide  for  certain  exceptions
in their national law, would be required to implement new  exceptions,  many
of which  would  be  alien  to  their  current  legal  system,  culture  and
traditions.  Furthermore, as the Member States would  then  be  required  to
transpose mandatory limitations and exceptions,  they  would  also  need  to
implement those limitations and exceptions,  where  the  CJEU  has  not  yet
provided a uniform interpretation.  At present,  EU  and  international  law
gives EU Member States the vital and necessary degree of  flexibility  which
is particularly important  in  view  of  the  different  legal  systems  and
traditions of the 28 Member States.


We continue to question the evidence of the  need  to  make  exceptions  and
limitations mandatory – the case for mandatory  exceptions  has  simply  not
been made.  In fact, the current EU  Copyright  framework  –  including  the
optional approach for exceptions and limitations –  provides  the  necessary
flexibility for promoting creativity and innovation  as  well  as  important
protection of the resulting works.  This is evidenced by  the  sheer  volume
of new works available – and the  abundance  of  new  devices  and  delivery
systems through which works can  be  accessed  and  enjoyed  throughout  the
European Union.


€ NO OPINION



  23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed  from
      the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


[Open question]


There is no need to add or to remove any of the limitations  and  exceptions
in the Copyright Directive.  The case for new exceptions has not been  made.
 Copyright has and continues to evolve in Europe.  Where there  is  evidence
of market failure or regulatory flaws and  there  is  sufficient  consensus,
solutions  have  been  found  (e.g.  the  Orphan  Works  Directive  and  the
forthcoming  Directive  on   Collective   Rights   Management).   Periodical
evaluations of copyright law and how it is functioning to achieve  its  aims
are important.  However, evidence for the need to change  must  be  provided
by those who seek such change. We do not  believe  that  such  evidence  has
been produced.

Copyright  should  continue  to  serve  the  public  interest  by  fostering
incentives to create, finance, market and distribute new works and  to  make
those works available to the public in new and innovative, compelling  ways.
The three-step test remains a flexible and pragmatic  legal  tool  providing
legislators and courts with the necessary room for  manoeuvre  when  framing
and interpreting exceptions and limitations.

  24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for
      a greater degree of flexibility in the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
      limitations and exceptions?

€ YES – Please explain why


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO – Please explain why


Flexibility is already an important component of the  EU  Copyright  Acquis.
In between national copyright systems and the  EU  Copyright  Acquis,  there
exists a fair amount of  margin  to  manoeuvre.   The  Copyright  Directive,
underpinned by recent jurisprudence of the CJEU, is itself  innovative.   In
the field of online  search  and  social  networks,  which  has  experienced
massive growth in recent years, it should be noted that  no  EU  legislation
or judicial decisions have  undermined,  let  alone  prevented,  the  launch
and/or sustainability  of  such  services  and  activities.   The  EU  legal
framework, including  the  Copyright  and  the  E-Commerce  Directives,  has
provided sufficient scope to allow new Internet companies and  platforms  to
thrive economically without specific regulation.


Given the flexibility afforded to  Member  States  by  the  current  system,
where national copyright systems and the  Copyright  Directive  coexist  and
are underpinned by the jurisprudence of the CJEU,  there  appears  to  be  a
more  than  sufficient  amount  of  flexibility  to  foster  innovation  and
accommodate developments in  technology,  new  uses  and  changing  consumer
demand.


€ NO OPINION


  25. If yes, what would be the best approach to  provide  for  flexibility?
      (e.g.  interpretation  by  national  courts  and  the  ECJ,   periodic
      revisions of the directives, interpretations by the Commission, built-
      in flexibility, e.g. in  the  form  of  a  fair-use  or  fair  dealing
      provision / open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would  be
      the relative advantages and disadvantages of such an approach as  well
      as its possible effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]


See Question 24. Although it is often asserted that a  ‘fair  use’  doctrine
could provide more  flexibility  than  the  European  system  of  predefined
exceptions and limitations, ‘fair use’ has its own disadvantages,  including
in particular legal uncertainty.  Fair use is determined on  a  case-by-case
basis, each case being examined  on  its  merits  thereby  making  a  priori
analysis hard to predict.  Courts are required to consider each of the  four
statutory factors relevant to establishing ‘fair use’, but Congress and  the
US  Supreme  Court  have  made  it  clear  that  “no  generally   applicable
definition is possible”. Each case must be determined on its own facts.


The European system of pre-defined exceptions  and  limitations  corresponds
better to the legal tradition of the great majority of  European  countries.
Indeed, even  the  UK  system,  which  is  underpinned  by  the  common  law
tradition, tends toward more specificity in the statute.  In  addition,  the
three-step test (as mentioned above) also grants a  measure  of  flexibility
to national legislators and  the  courts.   This  is  borne  out  by  recent
judgments of the CJEU.


  26. Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in  your
      experience, constitute a problem?

€ YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions  you  are  referring
to


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


☒NO – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you are referring to


Due to the territorial nature of copyright, the question of whether  or  not
a particular limitation or exception  is  relevant  to  a  specific  act  of
exploitation is a matter for the law of  the  country  where  protection  is
sought (generally where the use in question is taking place).   This  system
brings a significant degree of clarity – recent decisions of the  CJEU  have
also played a role in this area.


We are not aware of problems in this area.  The  production  of  audiovisual
content is dealt  with  by  contracts,  licensing  arrangements  and  rights
clearances, which  can  take  account  of  differences  in  limitations  and
exceptions in different territories.  Indeed, multiple local law  variations
are accommodated by the market place on a daily basis.


€ NO OPINION


  27. In the event that limitations and exceptions established  at  national
      level were to have cross-border effect, how  should  the  question  of
      “fair compensation” be addressed, when such compensation  is  part  of
      the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)

 [Open question]

Based on international norms and EU law,  such  uses  would  be  subject  to
compensation by the user in the country where the use takes place.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[41] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[42].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[43].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[44].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[45].

      to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right holder, a  collective

      enact legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the
      agreements concluded between libraries and collecting societies)  have
      a cross-border effect so that out of commerce works  can  be  accessed

Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

  43. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

We support the educational use of  film  materials  in  particular  for  the
study of film in schools and note that the use of  copyright  works  in  the
context of teaching and education is already dealt with in Articles 5 and  6
of the Copyright Directive. These strike the appropriate balance –  both  by
allowing the Member States  the  flexibility  to  implement  exceptions  for
illustration for teaching purposes  as  well  as  by  encouraging  licensing
solutions negotiated with right holders. The  necessary  limits  to  protect
this balance and ensure the incentive to create new works  are  set  by  the
three-test step at the EU and international levels.

Thus,  in  the  audiovisual  sector,  the  EU   Copyright   Acquis   permits
educational  institutions  to  reproduce  and  communicate  to  the   public
materials in the  context  of  both  face  to  face  teaching  and  distance
learning. The limitation of the use of  materials  to  “illustration”  means
that the generalised making available of  copyright  materials  to  distance
learners needs to be supplemented by licensing agreements. While film  clips
could be used to illustrate teaching materials, it would not be  permissible
to make complete feature film available to remote students in a course,  for
example,  on  film  history,   except   where   such   an   arrangement   is
authorised/licensed  by  the  relevant  right  holders.   Apart   from   the
limitative effect of the reference to “illustration”,  the  three-step  test
would not be satisfied. Such use would not amount to a  “special  case”  and
would conflict with the normal exploitation of the film  through  commercial
online services or other home entertainment distribution channels.  However,
institutions which  require  broader  use  of  such  materials  can  explore
licensing alternatives  with  the  relevant  right  holders.  The  scope  of

terms, for example concerning robust technological protection measures.

Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-

arrangements between right  holders  (or  their  representatives)  and  film
archives in the context of voluntary deposit  may  also  include  provisions
related to research.


Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[48]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [49].

The Marrakesh Treaty[50] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).

  50. (a) [In particular if you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
      organisation  representing  persons  with  disabilities:]   Have   you

audio description tools are  increasingly  made  available  for  audiovisual
content. Any new separate mandatory provision, for example providing for  an
obligation to make  available  content  in  a  particular  format  would  be
incompatible with technological developments over  time  and  would  be  ill
adapted to meeting the different current  and  future  needs  of  individual
disabled users. In general, individual and  flexible  contractual  solutions

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[51] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[52].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

We recognise that non-commercial data-mining would appear  to  be  a  useful
tool particularly in the  field  of  research.  However,  an  exception  for
commercial data-mining would not be permitted under the Copyright  Directive
and for good reason. Such an exception  at  EU  level  would  raise  serious
issues  and  potentially  conflict  with  licensing  schemes  developed   in
particular by publishers. Moreover, to the extent that any  exception  might
encompass search engine and indexing activities in general, there is a  risk
that it could become a defence deployed by infringing sites.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[53]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[54].

  62. If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what  would  be
      its main elements? Which activities should be covered and  under  what
      conditions?

[Open question]
We do not consider that there is a need  for  further  legislation  in  this
field.  Copyright  is  the  driving  force  behind  innovation  and  the  EU
Copyright Acquis provides a sufficient degree  of  flexibility  for  a  wide
range of technological  developments.  However,  opponents  of  the  current
system  of  exceptions  and  limitations   argue   that   their   need   for
“flexibility" is such that they need to be able to operate businesses  based
on the exploitation of the copyright  works  of  others  without  having  to
obtain licenses (i.e. for free or under wide-ranging  exceptions),  allowing
those services and  businesses  to  monetise  advertising  and  users’  data
without paying the customary price for the content that drives  the  traffic
to the service. This results in an unjustified and detrimental  transfer  of
wealth that deprives content producers and distributors of a fair return  on
their investment and consumers of compelling content as  decreased  revenues
for  content  producers  and  distributors   invariably   result   in   less
investment,  including  the  jobs  and  tax  revenues  stemming  from   that
investment.

According to some, this alleged lack of flexibility is the  explanation  for
a deficiency in European Internet companies – when in  reality  a  range  of
other important factors are at play and may better  explain  the  situation.
These include varying degrees of access to venture capital,  risk  aversion,
R&D expenditure, social  legislation,  taxes,  and  bankruptcy  laws,  among
others. Moreover, the EU Copyright Acquis has  not  prevented  international
Internet companies from enjoying, in a number  of  prominent  cases,  market
shares in the EU that are even higher than those achieved elsewhere  in  the
world.



  63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

[Open question]

There is no evidence of  problems  which  require  a  legislative  solution.
There  are  multiple  industry  initiatives  –  developed  with  a  view  to
addressing issues arising in different content sectors – which  involve  new
services and options while at the same time respecting copyright.



  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[55]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[56][57].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

  64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and
      application of the private copying and reprography  exceptions[58]  in
      the digital environment?

€ YES – Please explain

☒NO – Please explain


The language of the Copyright Directive itself is clear and recent case  law
has provided additional interpretation.  Article  5.2(b)  provides  that  on
condition that the following conditions are met,  acts  of  private  copying
may be covered by the exception: “reproductions on any medium by  a  natural
person for private use and for ends that are neither directly or  indirectly
commercial, on condition that the right holders  receive  fair  compensation
which takes account of the application or non-application  of  technological
measures...”. Specific reference is made to copies undertaken “by a  natural
person for private use”. As a result, copies made by a third party,  or  for
a third party, are excluded from the scope of the private copy exception  as
set out in Article 5.2(b) as are  reproductions  made  by,  for,  or  within
legal entities.   In  addition,  a  reference  to  the  principle  of  legal
source/access (the private copy exception only  comes  into  play  when  the
source/access is legal) as well as strict adherence to the  three-step  test
set out in Article 5.5 of the Copyright  Directive  is  essential.  Finally,
appropriate legal  protection  of  technological  measures  as  required  by
Article 6 of the Copyright Directive must be made available  under  national
law. Appropriate legal protection includes protection for  access  and  copy
controls, prohibition of acts  of  circumvention  and  preparatory  acts  of
circumvention accompanied by effective sanctions.


The digital distribution of copyright works can be  effectively  managed  at
source through technology or content management solutions, and  payment  can
be made directly.  This presents a vast range  of  opportunities  for  right
holders to engage in direct  licensing.   As  DRM-enabled  licensing  offers
greater efficiency and reduced costs, it benefits  electronic  commerce  and
end-users.  An example is cloud-based technologies, or  digital  lockers  in
the cloud, which have boosted  the  direct  exercise  of  exclusive  rights.
Licensed copies of film and audiovisual works in the  cloud  will  not  give
rise to levies.  To  the  extent  that  technological  measures  permit  the
direct exercise of the exclusive right of reproduction,  this  benefits  not
only all  right  holders  and  licensees  (authors,  performers,  producers,
distributors and publishers), but also the market place for copyright  works
in general and the end-users, who benefit from a wider  choice  of  business
propositions at different  price  points  (no  copies,  one  copy,  multiple
copies, etc.).

€ YES – Please explain

See Question 64. Although transparency is generally the preferred  approach,
any  new  “display”  obligation  must  also  take  into  account  the  cost-
effectiveness of the proposition. Any new obligation  should  avoid  placing
unreasonable burdens on  the  market  system  as  the  application  of  such
requirements may ultimately result in additional costs being  passed  on  to
retailers and/or end-users.


It is probably undesirable to require vendors by law to display  the  amount
of the levy, not only because it will increase costs for vendors,  but  also
because users may be led to think that in some sense they have paid for  the
“right” to use the equipment for  making  copies  from  any  source.  It  is
important  to  safeguard  the  principle  that  the  private  copy  levy  is
compensation for use which falls  within  the  scope  of  the  private  copy
exception and where the relevant conditions are met.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[62] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[63]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

      mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an
      adequate  remuneration  for  the  exploitation  of  your   works   and
      performances?

[Open question]

Remuneration of relevant right holders is a  legitimate  concern  and  there
are understandable preoccupations as to how remuneration models may  operate
under  an  audiovisual  value  chain  in  which  online   distribution   may
eventually play a more important role.   Any  future  policy  in  this  area
should  be  evidence-based  and  designed  on  the  basis  of  finding  real
solutions  to  real,  evidenced  problems,  thus  avoiding   upsetting   the
remuneration mechanisms evolved over many years through negotiation  between
producers and authors or performers at national level.

The existing legal  and  contractual  infrastructure  generally  allows  for
authors and performers to be  remunerated  upfront  for  their  contribution
(unlike the producer) and to receive further income streams  from  forms  of
secondary or tertiary exploitation.  These further payments may be based  on
a variety of  formulas,  e.g.  a  proportion  of  the  initial  remuneration
package paid up on each secondary sale, or a royalty stream from  the  value
of that sale, etc.  The virtue of  the  current  model,  in  which  economic
rights  are  transferred  by  law  or  by  contract  to  the   producer   or
representative agent, is that it allows for the licensing process to  remain
streamlined and expedient.  This centralization of the economic rights  with
the producer is crucial to the process of raising  financing  prior  to  the
actual production of the film and/or audiovisual content and provides  legal
certainty in the downstream exploitation of the final work.  This  practical
economic dimension should be borne in mind before considering any  statutory
modification  to  what  is  a  delicate  equilibrium  based   on   pragmatic
adjustment to business  realities,  national  traditions  and  long-standing
collective bargaining arrangements in some countries.

Though important in its own right,  remuneration  of  all  contributors,  be
they creators or other contributors to the collective work, is only  one  of
the strategic issues pertaining to online distribution and  the  adjustments
it will require. Of equal importance is the question  of  how  transactional
online distribution and  publishing  can,  in  the  long  run,  develop  the
economic capability  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  financing  of  new
creative content.  A mere remuneration model for authors and performers  for
future online distribution would fail to acknowledge the need for a  broader
return  on  investment  necessary  to  make  the   audiovisual   production,
financing and exploitation sector sustainable and to support the  very  high
costs attached to the development, production,  marketing  and  distribution
of new audiovisual content.

The  establishment  of  an  EU-level  “national”  remuneration  right  –  if
subjected to mandatory collective licensing – would  create  yet  a  further
layer of collective management  and  administration  fees.   The  uptake  of
online distribution services will  be  handicapped  by  such  an  additional
layer of administration.  Such a system would  serve  further  to  undermine
the value of copyright online by fuelling  the  current  misconception  that
copyright is a mere right to remuneration, leaving the weight  of  the  film
production pre-financing  responsibilities  on  the  “classic”  distribution
channels (theatrical, physical carriers, TV).

As a general matter, no  right  holder  should  be  forced  into  collective
management/licensing except in cases where exclusive rights are  subject  to
mandatory collective administration  for  reasons  of  practicability  under
relevant international law. Such cases are the exception (as in the case  of
cable retransmission), not the rule.

At EU level, the list of film authors is harmonized by  the  Term  Directive
which provides that the  principal  director  shall  be  considered  as  the
author or one of the authors (with a list of other authors for the  purposes
of measuring  term  of  protection).   Member  States  can  designate  other
authors (in Germany, the list is open and depends on the level  of  creative
contribution).  Member States can  also  designate  legal  entities  as  the
author (e.g., UK and Ireland). This of course raises the question  of  which
authors would benefit from a statutory remuneration right: would it  be  the
principal  director,  just  the  list  of  possible  authors  in  the   Term
Directive, or should the question be left  up  to  the  Member  States?  Any
action limiting the scope of the making available right would  in  our  view
raise questions about the legality of the  European  Union’s  implementation
of the WIPO treaties. A statutory remuneration right  subject  to  mandatory
collective licensing would also greatly diminish the value of the  exclusive
right centralized with the producer by operation  of  law  and/or  contract.
The end result is a limitation on the  author’s  exclusive  right  –  and  a
diminishing of the value of the rights the author can transfer to  producers
– which is potentially inconsistent with  international  norms.   Collecting
societies administrating the remuneration rights will seek payment from  the
platforms (not the production  companies).  This  takes  money  out  of  the
marketplace.  Producers and distributors would find that the platforms  were
willing to  pay  less  for  the  content  –  and  to  the  extent  residuals
(supplementary payments over and above the initial  lump  sum  remuneration)
were already being paid pursuant to  individual  or  collective  agreements,
authors and performers would be getting double payments. Measures  to  avoid
double payment risk further diminishing the value of the author’s  exclusive
right.

      certain clauses in contracts)?

€ NO OPINION


  74. If you consider that the current rules are not effective,  what  would
      you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

[Open question]

The current rules are effective. They  allow  film  producers,  authors  and
performers alike to be flexible,  innovative  and  act  in  accordance  with
their national traditions, employment cultures, and industry structures.


  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[64] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[65].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[66]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[67].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

  75. Should the civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
      efficient for infringements of copyright committed with  a  commercial
      purpose?

☒YES – Please explain


As a general matter, we support strict  and  efficient  enforcement  options
against commercial scale infringements.


€ NO – Please explain


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


……………………………………………………………………………………………….


€ NO OPINION


  76. In particular, is the current legal framework  clear enough  to  allow
      for   sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet
      service providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,
      domain  name  registrars,  etc.)  in   inhibiting   online   copyright
      infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what  measures  would
      be useful to foster the cooperation of intermediaries?

[Open question]

Right holders’ cooperation with Internet stakeholders in the  fight  against
online  infringements  is  often  frustrated  by  the  fact  that   Internet
intermediaries  generally  do  not  record  client  data  or   they   record
inaccurate  client  data.  Internet  intermediaries  such  as  domain   name
providers, hosting  providers,  payment  providers,  and  online  ad-brokers
should be  subject  to  “know  your  customer”  obligations  and  the  money
laundering Directive.  In particular, right holders should  have  the  legal
means to identify and locate commercial scale infringers.  The  existing  EU
“know your customer” legislation applies  to  banks,  lawyers,  real  estate
agents, casinos and we suggest that it should also  be  made  applicable  to
Internet intermediaries.  Anonymous  businesses  prevent  the  legal  system
from working in a fair and balanced manner.

  77. Does the current civil enforcement framework  ensure  that  the  right
      balance  is  achieved  between  the  right  to  have  one’s  copyright
      respected and other rights such as the protection of private life  and
      protection of personal data?

☒YES – Please explain


The CJEU has clarified in several  recent  decisions  that  national  courts
shall apply the proportionality test,  and  that  they  have  to  weigh  all
fundamental rights before coming to a fair and balanced decision.  In  doing
so, the courts shall take into account  the  rights  and  interests  of  the
parties and stakeholders concerned.


Given the breath of case law on  this  topic  and  the  fact  that  national
courts are  effectively  applying  the  required  balancing  of  fundamental
rights, including the right to property, there are sufficient safeguards  in
place to ensure fair and balanced decisions.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

  78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title,
      as a means of establishing  a  consistent  framework  for  rights  and
      exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a  single  framework
      for enforcement?

€ YES


☒NO


The introduction of  a  European  Copyright  Code  or  an  optional  Unitary
Copyright Title is very unlikely to produce the intended results  and  might
in fact take decades to achieve given the differing  views  across  the  EU.
Copyright is protected as part of the fundamental right  to  property  under
the EU legal  order.   As  a  result,  proposals  to  reform  the  copyright
framework in this way could raise a number of complex issues.  For  example,
there could be a possible conflict of laws were  an  EU  Copyright  Code  to
result in  expropriation  of  property  that  is  protected  under  national
constitutions.


It is our view that introducing a new Regulation on a  “Community  Copyright
Title”  alongside  national  titles  would  add  an  unnecessary  layer   of
complexity.  Simply replacing  current  national  systems  with  a  European
Copyright Title would appear premature and too complex for the  reasons  set
out above.


€ NO OPINION




  79. Should this be the next step in the development of  copyright  in  the
      EU? Does the current  level  of  difference  among  the  Member  State
      legislation mean that this is a longer term project?

[Open question]

The option to replace national laws by an EU Copyright Code  would  probably
take years, if  not  decades,  to  achieve.  The  EU  Acquis  is  extensive,
flexible and perfectly sufficient. Any action is only justified where  there
are evidence-based, proven  negative  effects  on  the  functioning  of  the
internal market, of which there are none.  European  and  international  law
gives EU  Member  States  the  necessary  degree  of  flexibility  which  is
particularly  important  in  view  of  the  different  legal   systems   and
traditions of the 28 Member States.

VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

  80. Are there  any  other  important  matters  related  to  the  EU  legal
      framework for copyright? Please explain and indicate how such  matters
      should be addressed.

accessed or received. Such an approach has already  been  introduced  at  EU
level with regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive  93/83/EEC  on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright  and  rights  related
to   copyright   applicable   to   satellite    broadcasting    and    cable

[28] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[29] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
