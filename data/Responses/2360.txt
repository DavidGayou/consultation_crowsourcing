    I.     Rights and the functioning of the Single Market
A.    Why is it not possible to access many online content services from anywhere in
Europe?


1.      [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced problems when
trying to access online services in an EU Member State other than the one in which you
live?


X YES - Problems in connection with the availability of services in other member states than
the one where the user lives do not result from the current EU copyright legislation but
various other sources:


   -     Lack of demand.
   -     Application of different taxation.
   -     Frequently, technical problems and cost reasons: access from abroad to consume
         content is much more expensive than from home.
   -     Differences in language from region to region
   -     Different provisions eg in terms of youth protection or age limits,


Under these circumstances, it shall be the free choice of the more than 3000 online service in
the EU where to make business and under which conditions to make a work available in EU.


2.      [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have you faced problems when seeking
to provide online services across borders in the EU?


X NO


Providers seeking to offer online services across the borders in the EU have all legal tools at
hand to secure the rights for such service.


Regional fragmentation of the markets, in particular for language differences, is a main reason
for limited consumer demand: eg the demand for content in German language in Italy, France,
Poland or the Czech Republic is minimal. Consequently, service providers offering such
service are unlikely to make the technical and logistic investments required for the
simultaneous offering of such service as it is not economically viable.


Therefore, right holders who are entitled to multi-territorial licensing in practice split their
licensing and focus on different markets in the ways required.




                                                                                              2
3.       [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:]
How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the Member State, the sector
and the type of content concerned.


Multiterritorial licenses are frequently granted in the audio visual sector. Yet in practice, as
described in the answer to questions 1 and 2, right holders who are entitled to multi-territorial
licensing split their licensing to focus on different markets in adequate ways. This is the most
efficient approach on the basis of contractual freedom to meet local demand with its regional
peculiarities. Such practice should remain legal.


4.      If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the questions above – what
would be the best way to tackle them?


We are convinced that industry led solutions are the most pragmatic and best way to go
forward. “Licensing for Europe” is a very good example in this context.


5.      [In particular if you are a right holder or a collective management organisation:] Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you hold all the necessary rights for all the
territories in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial
restrictions on a service provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain
content is not possible in certain European countries)?


X YES


Yes, independently from copyright and marketing aspects, also the following reasons often
justify different national approaches:
   -    youth protection rules,
   -    regulations on advertising,
   -    technical reasons including roaming costs,
   -    focus on the home market to ensure financial success before taking the financial risk
        to go live in other markets.

The freedom of the right holder to decide in which market and when to exploit his rights
reflects and supports cultural diversity: the right holder is most likely to make his content
available in the very region where sufficient demand arises. If an obligation to go live in the
entire EC simultaneously has the consequence that the costs are too high for the right holder,
such provisions would be likely to deter the right holder to go live at all. Consequently, such a
regime would be detrimental to the notion of supporting cultural diversity.


6.     [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:] Are there reasons
why, even in cases where you have acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would still find it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions on

                                                                                               3
the service recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different website
than the one he is trying to access)?


X YES


Main reason for a lack of cross border licensing is cultural diversity and a lack of significant
consumer demand. Local consumer demand tends to prefer local content because of the
language as well as the cultural differences.


7.     Do you think that further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-
led solutions) are needed at EU level to increase the cross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of protection for right
holders?


X NO


In the absence of evidence of market failure, there should be no legislative or policy
intervention in the audiovisual industry’s commercial and contractual freedom with regard to
territoriality and exclusivity provisions.


B.      Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what needs to be authorised
(or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


1.      The act of “making available”


8.     Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border situations – i.e. when
content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


X YES


The provisions of the InfoSoc-Directive 2001/29, the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of
the European Union on the making available right’s scope as well as questions of private
international law have already clarified the scope of this right. The scope of the right of
making available in cross-border situations is sufficiently clear:


The making available right builds on the interactive nature of the right and needs to be
interpreted in a wide sense. Consequently the right covers acts taking place not only in the
country of origin but everywhere where the access by consumers has an economic effect to

                                                                                              4
the disadvantage of the right holder and the content provider enables such access. Questions
concerning the applicability of the right in practice remain depending on the facts of each
case. To solve them falls within the competence of the courts. The user chooses individually
from where and when he accesses the service. “Streaming” is a prime example of such
accessing of content.


In the report unanimously adopted by the ALAI executive committee on Sept 16th 2013
(available at: http://www.alai.org/en/assets/files/resolutions/making-available-right-report-
opinion.pdf ) ALAI concluded:


        The exclusive right of “making available” under the WCT and the implementing EU
        legislation covers the offering to the public of a work for individualized streaming or
        downloading; in addition, where it takes place, the actual transmission of a work to
        members of the public also is covered, both irrespective of the technical means used
        for making available. In essence, what matters is that the act (i) is performed by an
        individual person (ii) directly or indirectly has the distinct effect of addressing the
        public, irrespective of the tool used by the individual, and (iii) concerns subject matter
        protected by copyright or related rights.


9.     [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification of the territorial scope
of the “making available” right have an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g.
whether you are considered to be an author or not, whether you are considered to have
transferred your rights or not), on your remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights
(including the availability of injunctive relief1)?


X YES


Anti piracy enforcement against services made available either in other EU countries or in
third countries would seriously be impeded if such offers could not be fought against in the
very markets where such service is not originating from, but where it is accessible and
accessed. A different approach would seriously harm right holders, who then could not fight
services having a serious negative economic impact on licensed services. Quite to the
contrary, this would support anonymous infringers. We are therefore convinced that no
country of origin only approach should be introduced. Such a concept would be detrimental to
current law and jurisprudence of the CJEU and the European Charta of Human Rights.


2.      Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


10.     [In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:] Does the application of two
rights to a single act of economic exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download)
create problems for you?

1
  Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing the right holder to stop or prevent
an infringement of his/her right.

                                                                                                 5
X NO
The application of two rights to a single act of economic exploitation is a legal banality which
does not cause any problems in practice.


3.      Linking and browsing


11.    Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright, either in general or under specific circumstances, be subject to
the authorisation of the rightholder?


X YES


The term “hyperlink” covers various forms of links, many of which directly enable the access
to a work without any additional technical steps required to be taken in between. Therefore,
hypertext links and inline links need to be differentiated. ALAI has analysed the different
functional approaches and, in its report unanimously adopted by the ALAI executive
committee          on           Sept           16th       2013            (available      at:
http://www.alai.org/en/assets/files/resolutions/making-available-right-report-opinion.pdf   )
concluded:


        As applied to hyperlinks, these findings lead to the following conclusions: (i) The
        making available right covers links that enable members of the public to access
        specific protected material; (ii) the making available right does not cover links that
        merely refer to a source from which a work may subsequently be accessed. It is
        irrelevant whether the link takes the user to specific content on a third-party website,
        or whether the linking site retains a frame around the content, so that the user is not
        aware that she is accessing the content from a third-party website.


In accordance with the jurisprudence of the CJEU, the cumulative economic effects of such
forms of access and use of works has to be taken into account so that the right holders can
adequately profit from such new forms of use and the markets which come into existence on
this basis. Consequently, the provision of any form of a hyperlink directly leading to a work
should require the authorization of the rightholder. However, this question is currently
pending before the CJEU (C-279/13, C More) and will be solved by the CJEU anyway soon.
Therefore, no legislative steps need to be taken in this respect.


12.    Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the temporary reproduction of
a work or other subject matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache
memory of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific circumstances, be
subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?



                                                                                              6
X YES


The mere viewing does not require any authorization of the right holder. Yet, frequently the
“mere viewing” does cause cache copies which are in fact permanent: Depending on the
software used, cache memory copies are often stored permanently today (eg the so called
DivX player enables this). Even if only temporary copies are made, from our point of view
the concept of the “making available right” is designed to cover on demand services which are
available around the clock, 24/7, thereby substituting permanent reproductions in a truly
comfortable way for the benefit of the end user and causing a significant cumulative
economic effect. For these reasons and in line with the goal of the InfoSoc-Directive 2001/29
(eg recital 10), streaming by the end user shall continue to require the authorization of the
right holder.


4.      Download to own digital content


13.     [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced restrictions when
trying to resell digital files that you have purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?


X NO OPINION


14.     [In particular if you are a right holder or a service provider:] What would be the
consequences of providing a legal framework enabling the resale of previously purchased
digital content? Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.


Such a change in the law would contradict the InfoSoc-Directive (see Recital 29) and extend
the principle of exhaustion beyond the distribution right in connection with tangible copies of
works to services in general. The consequence would be that the right holder loses the means
to control the creation of new, distinct digital reproductions of the work which have to be
created for the resale of previously purchased digital content.


From our point of view, the concept of exhaustion in connection with physical goods does not
fit with the making available of digital services. This has already been discussed by the CJEU
in the case Oracle vs. Usedsoft (C-128/11). The CJEU has also highlighted that such a change
in the law would be detrimental to the World Copyright Treaty (par 60).


Besides such legal arguments against such a change in the law, the result would also be
uncontrollable in fact: whereas it is fairly easy to control item-specific whether consent of the
right holder has been given in connection with traded physical copies, it is impossible to
control and enforce whether the principle of exhaustion is lawfully applied to digital files.




                                                                                               7
C.     Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?

15.     Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in the identification and
licensing of works and other subject matter?


X YES, IF VOLUNTARY


From our point of view, voluntary registration systems at EU level can lead to a considerably
higher degree of transparency in connection with the identification and the licensing of works
and other subject matter. Such registration platforms have already successfully been
established, eg the Entertainment Identify Registry ( www.eidr.org ) or the International
Standard Audiovisual Number ISAN, which has become an ISO-standard norm. Demand for
such registration databases may differ for various kinds of subject matter: In the audio visual
sector, due to the fact that all rights are likely to vest with the movie producers, rights
information can easily be traced by professionals.


In such cases, registration databases are not required or, given their costs, highly questionable.
In any case, evidence is required in advance to define which information shall be subject to
possible registration processes. This information might differ considerably from the
information collected by the OHIM in connection with the database for orphan works cited by
the EU commission in footnote 30 of this questionnaire.


Yet it is crucial that no formality requirements are introduced to copyright law in connection
with such registration efforts as they would contradict international copyright law. It has been
a huge achievement in the past to establish copyright protection internationally independent
from formality or registration requirements.


Given the unprofessional handling of the new website and registration processes by the OHIM
recently, which has caused great frustration amongst professionals, it has to be doubted
whether the development of official registration databases is a good idea.


16.    What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


Such a system can achieve greater transparency and make licensing agreements faster and
easier.


17.    What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


Such databases need to be current and therefore updated permanently, are costly, have to meet
high security criteria in order to reduce risks of abuse and might give too much weight to
registration and formality requirements, thereby misleading the creators in the first place and

                                                                                                8
putting off small and independent creators. Registration in such databases needs to be
informal yet complete, cost-free and the persons filing registrations need to guarantee that
they are entitled to provide information and that the information is correct.


Given the unprofessional handling of the new website and registration processes by the OHIM
recently, which has caused great frustration amongst professionals, it has to be doubted
whether the development of official registration databases is a good idea.


As some registration databases, based on private initiatives exist, eg www.eidr.org , confusion
might also be inevitable. Therefore, it might be better if the EU Commission leaves the
creation and administration of such databases entirely to the market which will develop
adequately if sufficient demand exists. The EU Commission should therefore focus on
supporting the existing databases.


18.     What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


Easy to access, free of charge, transparency, easy to adapt, supplied in a wide range of
flexible technical formats. Incentives must not be connected to copyright privileges as this
would contradict international copyright law.


D.      How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


19.    What should be the role of the EU in promoting the adoption of identifiers in the
content sector, and in promoting the development and interoperability of rights ownership
and permissions databases?


We consider support for the named identifiers in the content sector to be better approaches
than registration databases which are subject to questions 15. to 18. of this questionnaire.
We are of the opinion that improved and linked identification systems can support right
owners in the audio visual sector and increase transparency and reliability of data. This has to
go hand in hand with increased support for all databases which have already been created by
various stakeholders in order to improve interoperability on an international scale. Such
identification systems should focus on being as freely and flexibly accessible as possible.


E.      Term of protection – is it appropriate?


20.    Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate in the digital
environment?


X YES


                                                                                              9
The current terms of copyright protection are appropriate both in the analogue as well as the
digital world. A shortening of terms of protection would be inacceptable, also from a human
rights point of view. It would also contradict the EU commission’s recent successful activities
to extend the term of protection in connection with sound recordings. In this context shall be
added that the OHIM’s recent study on the relevance of IP-protection for the EU economy
highlighted that copyright-intensive industries contribute 4.2% to the EU’s GDP.


The question which needs to be raised here is: who would benefit from a shortening of terms
of protection of copyright protected subject matter? In truth, only industries whose business
concept is built on exploiting copyright protected content without contributing to creating new
content. In the long run, the shortening of the terms of protection would do nothing but
devalue the worth of creations and intellectual property. It would be detrimental to the
interests of the EU and the welfare of its citizens to do so.



   II.    Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


21.    Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations and exceptions
provided in the EU copyright directives are optional for the Member States?


X YES


The impact of the harmonisation of limitations and exceptions according to the InfoSoc-
Directive has taken time, but become more and more evident: based on the jurisprudence of
the CJEU, especially the interpretations of key provisions of the directive including the
application of the three-step test. Therefore, the system of limitations and exceptions is more
and more practiced in a harmonised way in the EU. The member states make increasing use of
their competences according to the directive. This serves the goal of the internal market. It is
self-understanding that the different traditions of copyright in many member states cannot be
overcome too quickly and the EU system of harmonizing on the basis of directives takes time.
Modifications of limitations and exceptions at this stage require careful analysis and key
evidence in order not to impede the current harmonisation process.


22.    Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so, is there a need for
a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


X NO


No, the current legal frame is sufficient and provides the flexibility required in the current
harmonization process. No modifications are required from our point of view.




                                                                                             10
For the sake of completeness, we highlight that the frequently discussed “fair use”-doctrine as
practiced in the USA is a legal concept not compatible with the current EU copyright system:
the concept is built on massive case law which has developed over many decades. Its
application would complicate the harmonization process taking place in the EU by
introducing a new, complex and alien concept. Therefore, we are against any initiative with
the goal to introduce it in EU copyright law.


23.    Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to or removed from the existing
catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


No, the current legal frame is sufficient and provides the flexibility required in the current
harmonization process. No modifications are required from our point of view.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to provide for a greater
degree of flexibility in the EU regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?


X NO


Providing Member States with more flexibility on limitations and exceptions is not necessary
because they already enjoy a sufficient degree of flexibility.


We highlight that the frequently discussed “fair use”-doctrine as practiced in the USA is a
legal concept not compatible with the current EU copyright system: the concept is built on
massive case law which has developed over many decades. Its application would complicate
the harmonization process taking place in the EU by introducing a new, complex and alien
concept. Therefore, we oppose any initiative with the goal to introduce it in EU copyright law.


25.    If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for flexibility? (e.g. interpretation
by national courts and the ECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations by the
Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a fair-use or fair dealing provision /
open norm, etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible effects on the functioning of the
Internal Market.

                                                                                            11
26.    Does the territoriality of limitations and exceptions, in your experience, constitute
a problem?


X NO


The impact of the harmonisation of limitations and exceptions according to the InfoSoc-
Directive has taken time, but become more and more evident: based on the jurisprudence of
the CJEU, especially the interpretations of key provisions of the directive including the
application of the three-step test, the system of limitations and exceptions is more and more
practiced in a harmonised way in the EU. The member states make increasing use of their
competences according to the directive. This serves the goal of the internal market. It is self-
understanding that the different traditions of copyright in many member states cannot be
overcome too quickly. Modifications of limitations and exceptions at this stage require careful
analysis and key evidence in order not to impede the current harmonisation process.


27.    In the event that limitations and exceptions established at national level were to
have cross-border effect, how should the question of “fair compensation” be addressed,
when such compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


The member states should be free to decide whether the fair compensation schemes in place
currently shall remain in their territory. Right holders’ income shall not be weakened by any
attempts to further harmonize limitations and exceptions in the EU.

We have observed that many creators, also those who grant licenses to third parties on the
basis of creative commons licenses, find it unacceptable that persons relying on their content
do not respect their moral rights, in particular the right of attribution as well the adaptation
right. In practice, creators who devote their professional life to the creation of works, do not
consider it a compliment if their finished work is adapted, amended or changed by others. At
the same time, persons exploiting and disrespecting rights of others in this manner frequently
have the intention of exploiting such creations of others in order to monetize them, eg on
Youtube, for their own benefit. Every creator therefore should have the right to effectively
and efficiently be able to enforce how third parties use his or her work. Whether the third
party has commercial interests should not be decisive in order to be in control.

party has commercial interests should not be decisive in order to be in control.


60.    (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right holder):] Have you
experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the use of the work you have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?
(b) [In particular if you are a service provider:] Do you provide remuneration schemes for
users publishing/disseminating the works they have created (on the basis of pre-existing
works) through your service?


X YES


We have observed that many creators, also those who grant licenses to third parties on the
basis of creative commons licenses, find it unacceptable that persons relying on their content
do not respect their moral rights, in particular the right of attribution as well the adaptation
right. In practice, creators who devote their professional life to the creation of works, do not

For these reasons, the remuneration aspect is only one side of the problem, the moral right
issue being the other. Right holders observe though that works of others based on their own
pre existing works are frequently monetized, not only on platforms like Youtube, but also on
other notoriously and structurally infringing websites. Youtube provides remuneration
schemes for users uploading material including such which is based on pre-exisitng works.
The pre-upload procedure does not sufficiently control the ID of uploaders and does not deter
infringing uploaders from illegal activity: in fact, the registered user remains anonymous.
Even if blocked, it is very easy for him to be registered again with a slightly different, in fact
anonymous ID to repeat his infringing activity. Youtube intentionally takes this infringing
practice into account from our point of view.


61.     If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


The problems described above largely relate to enforcement and awareness. Therefore,
support of balanced, effective and efficient enforcement of the rights of creators plus strict
application of limits of provider liability rules in accordance with the jurisprudence of the
CJEU would be a solution.


62.   If your view is that a legislative solution is needed, what would be its main
elements? Which activities should be covered and under what conditions?

63.        If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


As traditional media are usually obliged to produce European content and as broadcasters are
obliged to broadcast such content, we consider it to be discriminating that new media are not
obliged to contribute to the financing of such content at all.


    III.     Private copying and reprography


64.     In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the scope and application of
the private copying and reprography exceptions2 in the digital environment?


X NO


The relevant provisions which are contained in the Directive 2001/29 are sufficiently clear
while leaving enough flexibility to the Member States. From our point of view, the CJEU has
already provided decisive interpretation regarding the scope and application of these
exceptions (C-467/08 – Padawan, C-462/09 – Opus, C-457/11 – Kyocera, C-521/11). Further
judgments are awaited soon (eg C-435/12 – ACI Adam). Under these circumstances, the
CJEU provides the guidance required in the process of harmonization on EU level, including
contemporary understanding of the storage media to which these exceptions and levies in this
context apply. The national courts follow this guidance, even if it takes time until cases
dealing with these issues are finally decided. In our opinion, initiatives of the legislator are
not required and would only disturb the ongoing harmonization process.


Over the years a successful system of remuneration of authors has been established in Austria
which is firmly built on the private copy levy system. Additional obligatory legislative tools
are likely to harm this system.


65.     Should digital copies made by end users for private purposes in the context of
a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and where the harm to the rightholder is
minimal, be subject to private copying levies?3




2
 Art. 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

 This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on
private copying and reprography levies

                                                                                                          20
X YES


It is unclear from our point of view on which basis the European Commission assumes that
the harm rightholders face in connection with digital copies made for private purposes from
licenced sources is per se minimal. This assumption also contradicts the CJEU’s
understanding in the Kyocera case (C-521/11) and the VG Wort case (C-457/11-C-460/11)
and that cumulative economic effects of acts of countless private internet users who are not
connected with each other need to be taken into account (see eg C-607/11 – TVCatchUp). In
fact, the number of private copies has increased dramatically with the new digital media and
has also led to a much higher level in consumer comfort. This justifies substantial private
copying levies.


66.    How would changes in levies with respect to the application to online services (e.g.
services based on cloud computing allowing, for instance, users to have copies on different
devices) impact the development and functioning of new business models on the one hand
and rightholders’ revenue on the other?


The Vitorino report ignores in this context that the licencing of new business models and
private copy levies cover totally separate ways of use of the works. The CJEU has made this
explicitly clear (eg Kyocera case, C-521/11). New business models building their success on
content produced by third parties should have to honour the creator’s interest with a fair share
and compensation. Also, the end users should contribute to the convenience gained with such
a model to use the creations of third parties. In a legal system with a fair balance of rights, it
would be unjust


    -   if such new business models would not be required to have to take the rights of third
        parties they rely on into account and

    -   if the end users’ practice would not be mirrored in private copy levy income of the
        creator as practised in many countries today.


67.     Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the invoices for products
subject to levies?4


X YES


Such a step is positive to increase a higher degree of transparency. Yet we are of the opinion
that it is not necessary to regulate this in the InfoSoc-Directive.

68.   Have you experienced a situation where a cross-border transaction resulted in
undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy, or other obstacles to the free
movement of goods or services?


X NO


We are not aware that the current system leads to any undue payments. The current
reimbursement scheme differentiates between private and commercial users. According to the
Austrian collecting society, about one third of all blank media in Austria (including hard
discs) are used by commercial entities. Cross-border transactions are no issue since any
importer and direct seller of blank media in or to Austria has to pay the levy. The importer or
direct seller may obtain reimbursement of a foreign levy from that Member State, in
accordance with the Amazon ruling. Due to their permanent increase, direct sellers should be
subject to better control and enforcement by the collecting societies, in order to fight abuse
and circumvention of the private copying regimes.


69.     What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold to persons other than natural
persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying? Do any of those transactions

  IV.     Fair remuneration of authors and performers


72.    [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or
combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the
exploitation of your works and performances?


We highlight that question 72 does not refer to producers and therefore excludes a highly
relevant group of right holders.


The real challenge is to develop an online policy which gives the online market the freedom
to develop so that the online platforms themselves are able and responsible for the
development of the financing and development of productions in order to realise a return in
investment which is worthwhile. An obligatory remuneration via a levy on EU level would
impede such a process and would directly harm the economically instable online distributors
in smaller EC member states.


73.    Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit certain clauses in
contracts)?


X NO

There is no need to act at EU level: contracts vary from sector to sector, and so do national
rules from one Member State to another. It does not appear to be necessary to harmonise these
rules in any more detail, as no problems have occurred in practice and the principle of
subsidiarity should prevail.


Different from other EC member states, minimum wages which are binding for movie
producers have been agreed in a binding way akin to a state statute. This mechanism
guarantees that all persons contributing to a movie are adequately paid. Legal instruments


                                                                                            23
intervening in this system have to be made us of very carefully and are not necessary from our
point of view.

address the shortcomings you identify?

   V.     Respect for rights


75.    Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more efficient for
infringements of copyright committed with a commercial purpose?


X NO


It is not clear how the term “commercial” is to be understood.


We are of the opinion that the European Charta of Human Rights and international copyright
law demand an efficient, proportionate and effective enforcement of copyrights regardless
whether the infringer acts for a commercial purpose.


Discrimination is only justified when it comes to the consequences of copyright infringement:
eg in Austria, commercial copyright infringements can be prosecuted criminally and not only
in civil litigation.


A discrimination differentiating between more and less effective enforcement cannot be
accepted. It would also make practice more complicated, as the InfoSoc-Directive does not
harmonise moral rights. The suggested approach would lead to a gap between enforcing the
rights which are harmonised on EU level and the ones which aren’t. The notion to improve
enforcement in general for all right holders regardless whether the infringement has any
commercial background or impact is seen positive by us.



                                                                                           24
76.    In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow for sufficient
involvement of intermediaries (such as Internet service providers, advertising brokers,
payment service providers, domain name registrars, etc.) in inhibiting online copyright
infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what measures would be useful to foster
the cooperation of intermediaries?


In our opinion, the current legal system is rightly based on a responsibility of intermediaries
(see Art 8 (3) InfoSoc-Dir). In various countries, this provision has not been implemented
though, eg in Germany. This leads to diverging jurisprudence in the member states. An
improvement for the benefit of right holders could be achieved if their legal means to identify
and locate commercial scale infringers could be extended. In practice, data protection rules
make such identification and localization impossible, in particular in Austria.


We are active in precedent, not yet finished cases, eg in connection with the biggest every
copyright infringing platform in the German speaking territories, kino.to (C-314/12). Internet
service providers are key bottlenecks for making the advertising income driven business of
online piracy worthwhile. Therefore, the providers need to contribute their share to cut such
criminals like the persons behind kino.to off from their revenue stream.


77.     Does the current civil enforcement framework ensure that the right balance is
achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected and other rights such as the
protection of private life and protection of personal data?


X YES


The jurisprudence of the CJEU has given all required guidance for national courts to achieve a
fair and proportionate weighing up of the interests of all the parties involved.


     VI. A single EU Copyright Title


78.    Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright Title, as a means
of establishing a consistent framework for rights and exceptions to copyright across the
EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?


X NO


We consider the codification of the current EU copyright directives to be of more relevance
than the establishment of a single EU copyright title. The latter would be premature and, as a
parallel copyright system, unnecessarily complicate copyright management and enforcement
in the whole EU. We are therefore against introducing such a concept.




                                                                                            25
79.    Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the EU? Does the
current level of difference among the Member State legislation mean that this is a longer
term project?


The continued, more and more harmonized application of the EU copyright acquis seems the
more pragmatic approach.


 VII.     Other issues


80.    Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal framework for
copyright? Please explain and indicate how such matters should be addressed.


We are of the opinion that the following matters should be addressed:
   a) Support for a better, faster and stricter enforcement of copyright claims, implementing
      the CJEU’s and ECHR’s standards for effective copyright enforcement.
   b) Obligatory contribution of new media and providers to the financing of the content
      they build their business case on
   c) Clearer regulations to control market dominating and oligopolistic players, especially
      of US platforms on the EC market: exactly such platforms have to bear responsibility
      for European content.
   d) Creative Europe: creation of specific support (eg for audience building) for specific
      European online initiatives, online platforms with European content or national online
      platforms with a European focus.
   e) Effectuating European quota for non linear media
   f) Extending the responsibility of the provider industry to fight copyright infringements
      and reduction of the possibility for illegal online services to generate income based on
      advertising turnover.
   g) Bundling of rights vesting with the producer also in relation to broadcasters, in
      particular a reversion of rights in the interest of the exploitation of archives.
