   I. Introduction


Context of the consultation


Over the  last  two  decades,  digital  technology  and  the  Internet  have
reshaped the ways in which content is created,  distributed,  and  accessed.
New opportunities have  materialised  for  those  that  create  and  produce
content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new  and  existing  distribution
platforms, for institutions  such  as  libraries,  for  activities  such  as
research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –  for
information,  education  or   entertainment   purposes   –   regardless   of
geographical borders.


This new environment also presents  challenges.  One  of  them  is  for  the
market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution  and  use.  Another
one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of  rights,  limitations
to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and  is  adapted  to  the  new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second  of  these  challenges:
ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays  fit  for  purpose
in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the  full
potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our  economy
and promote cultural diversity.


In its "Communication on  Content  in  the  Digital  Single  Market"[1]  the
Commission set out two parallel tracks  of  action:  on  the  one  hand,  to
complete its on-going effort to review and to  modernise  the  EU  copyright
legislative framework[2][3] with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether  to
table  legislative  reform  proposals,  and  on  the  other,  to  facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue  "Licences
for Europe" on issues on which  rapid  progress  was  deemed  necessary  and
possible.


The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now[4]. The  Commission
welcomes the practical solutions  stakeholders  have  put  forward  in  this
context  and  will  monitor  their  progress.  Pledges  have  been  made  by
stakeholders in  all  four  Working  Groups  (cross  border  portability  of
services, user-generated content, audiovisual and  film  heritage  and  text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects  these  pledges  to
be a further step in making the user environment easier  in  many  different
situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact  that  two  groups  –
user-generated content and text and data mining – did  not  reach  consensus
among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be  addressed  or
on the results. The discussions and results of "Licences  for  Europe"  will
be also taken into account in the context of the review of  the  legislative
framework.


As part of the review process, the Commission  is  now  launching  a  public
consultation on issues identified in the Communication  on  Content  in  the
Digital  Single  Market,  i.e.:  "territoriality  in  the  Internal  Market,
harmonisation, limitations and exceptions to copyright in the  digital  age;
fragmentation  of  the  EU  copyright  market;  and  how  to   improve   the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  enforcement   while   underpinning   its
legitimacy in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in  the
October 2013 European Council  Conclusions[5]  "Providing  digital  services
and content across  the  single  market  requires  the  establishment  of  a
copyright  regime  for  the  digital  age.  The  Commission  will  therefore
complete its on-going review of the EU copyright framework in  spring  2014.
It is important  to  modernise  Europe's  copyright  regime  and  facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of  intellectual  property
rights and taking into account cultural diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public  hearings,  in
particular  those  on  the  "Green  Paper  on  copyright  in  the  knowledge
economy"[6], the "Green Paper on  the  online  distribution  of  audiovisual
works"[7] and "Content Online"[8].  These  consultations  provided  valuable
feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions, on  issues  as  diverse
as  the  territoriality  of  copyright  and  possible   ways   to   overcome
territoriality,  exceptions  related  to   the   online   dissemination   of
knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in  the  audiovisual
sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in  the
value  chain,  including  right  holders,   distributors,   consumers,   and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way  to
proceed. The "Green  Paper  on  Copyright  in  the  Knowledge  Economy"  was
followed up by a Communication. The replies  to  the  "Green  Paper  on  the
online  distribution  of  audiovisual  works"  have  fed   into   subsequent
discussions on the Collective  Rights  Management  Directive  and  into  the
current review process.

  II. Rights and the functioning of the Single Market


Why is it not possible to access many online content services from  anywhere
in Europe?


[The territorial scope of the rights involved in digital  transmissions  and
the segmentation of the market through licensing agreements]


Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers,  singers,  musicians
- do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,  they  are  protected
on the basis of a bundle of national rights  in  each  Member  State.  Those
rights have been largely harmonised by the existing EU Directives.  However,
differences remain and the geographical scope of the rights  is  limited  to
the  territory  of  the  Member  State  granting  them.  Copyright  is  thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced on a country-
by-country basis under national law[9].


The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet –  e.g.  by
a music streaming service,  or  by  an  online  e-book  seller  –  therefore
requires, in principle, an authorisation  for  each  national  territory  in
which the content is  communicated  to  the  public.  Rightholders  are,  of
course, in a position to grant a multi-territorial or pan-European  licence,
such that content services can be provided  in  several  Member  States  and
across borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to  facilitate
multi-territorial licences: the  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  Collective
Rights Management[10] should significantly facilitate the delivery of multi-
territorial  licences  in  musical  works  for  online   services[11];   the
structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences  for  Europe”[12]  and  market-led
developments such as the on-going work in the Linked Content Coalition[13].


"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue  of  cross-
border portability, i.e. the  ability  of  consumers  having  subscribed  to
online  services  in  their  Member  State  to  keep  accessing  them   when
travelling temporarily to other Member States. As a result,  representatives
of  the  audio-visual  sector  issued  a  joint  statement  affirming  their
commitment to continue working towards the  further  development  of  cross-
border portability[14].


Despite  progress,  there  are  continued  problems  with  the  cross-border
provision of, and access to,  services.  These  problems  are  most  obvious
to consumers wanting to access services that are made  available  in  Member
States other than the one in which they live. Not all  online  services  are
available in all Member States  and  consumers  face  problems  when  trying
to access such services across borders.  In  some  instances,  even  if  the
“same” service is available in all Member States,  consumers  cannot  access
the service across borders (they can only access their  “national”  service,
and if they try to access the "same" service in another  Member  State  they
are redirected to the one designated for their country of residence).


This situation may in part  stem  from  the  territoriality  of  rights  and
difficulties  associated  with  the  clearing   of   rights   in   different
territories.  Contractual  clauses  in licensing  agreements  between  right
holders and distributors and/or between distributors and end users may  also
be at the origin of some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).


The main issue  at  stake  here  is,  therefore,  whether  further  measures
(legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to  be
taken at EU level in  the  medium  term[15]  to  increase  the  cross-border
availability of content services in the Single  Market,  while  ensuring  an
adequate level of protection for right holders.


1. [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have you faced  problems
when trying to access online services in an EU Member State other  than  the
one in which you live?


n/a


2. [In particular if you are a service provider:] Have  you  faced  problems
when seeking to provide online services across borders in the EU?


n/a


3. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] How often are you asked to grant multi-territorial  licences?
Please indicate, if possible, the number of requests per  year  and  provide
examples indicating the Member State, the sector and  the  type  of  content
concerned.


Sweden ranks third in the world when it comes to music  export.  The  reason
for this is that some of the most successful songwriters in the  world  come
from Sweden and are represented by music publishers here. This  success  has
led to an environment with high creative standards and a new  generation  of
talent have been nurtured.


In spite of Sweden being a small territory, our members grant licenses on  a
daily basis for local, pan-European and worldwide licenses for  both  online
and offline use and for many different campaigns. The standard  praxis  when
it comes to online licensing for advertisement and commercials  is  that  if
the territory is not restricted in  the  agreement  the  licensed  territory
will cover the world. Most TV and film licenses almost always cover  several
European territories and often the whole  of  Europe.  Most  music  services
such  as  Spotify,  iTunes,  YouTube,  wimp  are  licensed   on   a   multi-
territorial/pan-European basis  through  the  relevant  PRS  and  mechanical
society.


4. If you have identified problems in the answers to any  of  the  questions
above – what would be the best way to tackle them?


As most major music publishers have  adjusted  to  the  digital  market  via
adopting  different  licensing  schemes  for  pan-European  licensing  since
several years, we do not agree that  there  are  significant  problems  with
cross border access  of  content.  In  our  opinion  the  current  EU  legal
framework and the existing copyright framework enables  the  development  of
numerous licensing models at a pan-European basis and is  satisfactory.  The
fact that a copyright is territorial is not per se an obstacle for it  being
licensed across the whole of Europe.  If  there  is  a  restriction  to  the
access of (in  our  case)  music,  cross  borders,  it’s  the  result  of  a
commercial decision to engage  in  single  or  multi-territorial  licensing.
This decision is made by users  with  due  consideration  for  local  demand
(cultural preferences, language, etc.).


When it comes to the collecting societies and the licensing  made  by  them,
we believe that the adoption  of  the  EU  Directive  on  Collective  Rights
Management will help promote a digital  market  and  the  licensing  of  our
rights.


We would like to stress that it is vital  for  further  digital  development
within the EU that the Internet access is expanded.


5. [In particular if you are a  right  holder  or  a  collective  management
organisation:] Are there reasons why, even in cases where you hold  all  the
necessary rights for all the territories in question, you would  still  find
it necessary or justified to impose territorial restrictions  on  a  service
provider (in order, for instance, to ensure that access to  certain  content
is not possible in certain European countries)?


NO. But, this should be left in the  music  publisher’s  or  right  holder’s
discretion. Sometimes music publishers limit the territory in a license,  as
the  price  of  a  usage  of  music  in  a  commercial/advertisement  differ
depending upon the size of the territory and if the requested  territory  is
being customized by user. By limiting the territory,  music  publishers  are
able to offer the use of the music at a lower rate than if we were  required
to offer the use to all the EU.


6. [In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service provider:]  Are
there reasons why, even in cases where you have acquired all  the  necessary
rights for all  the  territories  in  question,  you  would  still  find  it
necessary or justified to impose territorial  restrictions  on  the  service
recipient (in order for instance, to redirect the  consumer  to  a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?


n/a


7. Do you think  that  further  measures  (legislative  or  non-legislative,
including market-led solutions) are needed  at  EU  level  to  increase  the
cross-border availability of content services in the  Single  Market,  while
ensuring an adequate level of protection for right holders?


NO. As said above we think the current EU legal framework and  the  existing
copyright framework is satisfactory. But again  would  like  to  stress  the
fact that it is important for the digital development  within  the  EU  that
the Internet access will be expanded.


Is there a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what  needs  to  be
authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?


[The definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]


The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights  in  the
digital environment is largely established by  Directive  2001/29/EC[16]  on
the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in  the
information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant  in
the online environment are those relating to the protection of  software[17]
and databases[18].


Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises  the  rights  of  authors  and  neighbouring
rightholders[19] which are essential for the transmission of digital  copies
of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a  record
in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.


The most relevant rights for  digital  transmissions  are  the  reproduction
right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit  the  making  of  copies[20],
(notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the  uploading  of
a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it  available  –  and
at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital  copy  of  a  work)
and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the  rights
to  authorise  or  prohibit  the  dissemination  of  the  works  in  digital
networks[21].   These   rights   are   intrinsically   linked   in   digital
transmissions and both need to be cleared.


The act of “making available”


Directive 2001/29/EC  specifies  neither  what  is  covered  by  the  making
available right (e.g. the upload,  the  accessibility  by  the  public,  the
actual reception by the public) nor where  the  act  of  “making  available”
takes place. This does not raise questions  if  the  act  is  limited  to  a
single territory. Questions  arise  however  when  the  transmission  covers
several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act  of  "making
available" happen in the  country  of  the  upload  only?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content  is  potentially  accessible?  in  each  of  the
countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent  case
law of the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)  suggests  that  a
relevant  criterion  is  the  “targeting”  of   a certain   Member   State's
public[22]. According to this approach  the  copyright-relevant  act  (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are  “targeted”
by the online service provider. A  service  provider  “targets”  a group  of
customers residing in a specific country when it  directs  its  activity  to
that group, e.g. via advertisement,  promotions,  a language  or  a currency
specifically targeted at that group.


8. Is the scope of the “making available” right in  cross-border  situations
– i.e. when content is disseminated across borders – sufficiently clear?


YES, but it is important that licensing should be  subject  to  tariffs  and
jurisdiction of targeted territories to prevent forum shopping. The country-
of-origin principle must be avoided for online licensing as  it  allows  for
forum shopping for the lowest price.





9. [In particular if you are a right holder:] Could a clarification  of  the
territorial scope of the “making available” right  have  an  effect  on  the
recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you are considered to be an  author
or not, whether you are considered to have transferred your rights or  not),
on your remuneration,  or  on  the  enforcement  of  rights  (including  the
availability of injunctive relief[23])?


€YES.


There is no need to clarify the territorial scope of the “making  available”
rights.


However,  we  do  believe  that  there  is  a  need  to  ensure   a   better
implementation of Article  8.3  of  the  Copyright  Directive.  Pan-European
injunctive reliefs should work  effectively  in  practice,  as  each  Member
State shall take any and  all  measures  necessary  to  ensure  that  rights
holders whose  interests  have  been  affected  by  an  infringing  activity
carried out on its territory can bring an action for  damages  and/or  apply
for an injunction and, where appropriate,  for  the  seizure  of  infringing
material. EU Member States  shall  ensure  that  rights  holders  are  in  a
position to apply for an injunction against  intermediaries  whose  services
are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or a related right.


Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation


Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the  current  state
of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are  two
rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right  and  the
making available right. This may  complicate  the  licensing  of  works  for
online  use  notably  when  the   two   rights   are   held   by   different
persons/entities.


10. In particular if you a service provider or  a  right  holder:  Does  the
application of two rights to a single act of economic  exploitation  in  the
online environment (e.g. a download) create problems for you?


YES, this would constitute problems for our territory.  As  78,3  %  of  the
income from music sales are digital in Sweden and 94%  of  this  comes  from
streaming, this will affect our market quite a bit. If  streaming  where  to
be considered only performance income (not as  50%  performance  income  and
50% mechanical income as today) our mechanical income from online use  would
most probable decrease significantly.  This  would  mean  the  end  for  our
mechanical society, ncb,  and  we  would  be  facing  a  new  administrative
problem of how to collect our offline mechanical income. It is  our  opinion
that today’s system of a bundle of right implicates no difficulties for  the
market.


Linking and browsing


Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in  the
Internet to another. They are  indispensable  for  the  functioning  of  the
Internet as a network. Several cases are  pending  before  the  CJEU[24]  in
which the question has been raised  whether  the  provision  of  a clickable
link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making  available  to
the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing  a  web-page)  regularly  creates
temporary  copies  of  works  and  other  subject-matter   protected   under
copyright on the screen and  in  the  'cache'  memory  of  his  computer.  A
question has been referred to the CJEU[25] as to  whether  such  copies  are
always  covered  by  the  mandatory  exception   for   temporary   acts   of
reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

11. Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or  other  subject
matter protected under  copyright,  either  in  general  or  under  specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the rightholder?

We agree with the opinion of ALAI here.  The  linking  to  targeted  content
infringes the making available right if (i) the content  is  initially  made
available without the right holders consent, or  (ii)  technical  protection
measures have been circumvented or (iii) the availability  of  the  content,
even if initially  disclosed  over  the  internet  with  consent,  otherwise
clashes with the declared or clearly implied will of the rights holder.

12. Should the viewing of  a  web-page  where  this  implies  the  temporary
reproduction of a work or other subject matter protected under copyright  on
the screen and in the  cache  memory  of  the  user’s  computer,  either  in
general or under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation  of
the rightholder?

The exemption in article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive clearly states  when
the exclusive right of reproduction can be exempted. Only temporary acts  of
reproduction,  which  are  transient  or  incidental  and  an  integral  and
essential part of a technological process  and  whose  sole  purpose  is  to
enable (a)  a  transmission  in  a  network  between  third  parties  by  an
intermediary, or (b) a lawful use of a work or other  subject-matter  to  be
made,  and  which  have  no  independent  economic  significance,  shall  be
exempted from the reproduction right. Browsing falls  within  the  scope  of
article 5.1 of the Copyright Directive. Musikförläggarna is of  the  opinion
that this copyright exception should not be made broader and  should  remain
subject to all its pre-conditions.  In  particular,  we  consider  that  the
condition  that  only  temporary  acts  of  reproduction  “which   have   no
independent economic  significance”  is  crucial.  For  example,  viewing  a
website where music is streamed can be considered as browsing. However  this
act has an “independent economic significance” and should be considered  out
of the scope of browsing  and  therefore  subject  to  the  rights  holders’
authorisation.  This  is  especially  important  bearing  in  made  the  new
websites popping up all over EU offering streaming services  of  music  that
is unauthorised.  As  you  only  stream  onto  your  media  player  in  your
computer, you actually do not copy anything and it cannot be  considered  to
be a communication to the public.

Download to own digital content


Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission  (e.g.
download to own). Questions  arise  as  to  the  possibility  for  users  to
dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by  selling  them  or  by
giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of  the  distribution
right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g.  when
a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold,  the  right  holder
cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible  article)[26].  The
issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in  the
case of an act of transmission equivalent  in  its  effect  to  distribution
(i.e. where the buyer acquires the property of the  copy)[27].  This  raises
difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application  of  such
an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using  a  copy  of  a  work
after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred  to  as  the  “forward
and delete” question) as  well  as  to  the  economic  implications  of  the
creation of a second-hand market of copies of  perfect  quality  that  never
deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).


13.  In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:  Have  you  faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files  that  you  have  purchased
(e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

would be the consequences  of  providing  a  legal  framework  enabling  the

(type                 of                 content)                  concerned



NO, digital downloads cannot be compared to physical copies  in  this  sense
and it is impossible to control the destruction  of  the  original  copy  in
reality.


Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a good idea?


Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as  the  existing
international treaties in the area prohibit formalities as a  condition  for
the protection and exercise of rights.  However,  this  prohibition  is  not
absolute[28]. Moreover a system of registration does not  need  to  be  made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and  exercise  of
rights.  With  a  longer  term  of  protection  and   with   the   increased
opportunities that digital  technology  provides  for  the  use  of  content
(including older  works  and  works  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been
disseminated), the advantages and disadvantages of a system of  registration
are increasingly being considered[29].


15. Would the creation of a registration system at  EU  level  help  in  the
identification and licensing of works and other subject matter?


NO.


The protection  originating  from  the  Berne  convention  states  that  the
protection of copyrighted works shall  not  be  subject  any  formality  and
attain legal protection just its mere creation if originality  is  achieved.
It  is  the  opinion  of  Musikförläggarna  that  the  current   system   is
satisfactory.


16. What would be the possible advantages of such a system?


-


17. What would be the possible disadvantages of such a system?


As the music publishers already register all the works they  represent  with
the PRS and also have numerous in-house databases,  more  administration  is
not needed unless it is absolutely  guaranteed  that  it  will  benefit  and
promote licensing of works and effective  protection  of  the  rights.  This
being said  we  keenly  await  the  development  of  The  Global  Repertoire
Database; a single, authoritative database on global ownership  and  control
of musical  works  would  greatly  help  the  efficiency  of  licensing  and
protection of copyrighted works.


18. What incentives for registration by rightholders could be envisaged?


Please see above question 15.


How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers


There are many private databases of works and other subject matter  held  by
producers, collective management organisations,  and  institutions  such  as
libraries, which are based to a greater or  lesser  extent  on  the  use  of
(more  or  less)  interoperable,   internationally   agreed   ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in  a  work,  are
specific to the sector in which they have been developed[30], and  identify,
variously, the work itself, the owner or the contributor to a work or  other
subject matter. There are notable examples of where industry is  undertaking
actions to improve the interoperability of such identifiers  and  databases.
The Global Repertoire  Database[31]  should,  once  operational,  provide  a
single source of information on the ownership and control of  musical  works
worldwide. The Linked  Content  Coalition[32]  was  established  to  develop
building blocks for the expression and management of  rights  and  licensing
across all content and media types. It includes the development of a  Rights
Reference Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types  of  rights
in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub[33] is seeking  to  take  such
identification systems a step further, and  to  create  a  linked  platform,
enabling automated licensing across different sectors.


19.  What  should  be  the  role  of  the  EU  in  promoting  the   adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the  development  and
interoperability of rights ownership and permissions databases?


Musikförläggarna asks EU to promote and support the already  on  going  work
with the GRD. It is  a  global  project  and  it  will  need  political  and
financial  support.  It  is  also  important   not   to   launch   competing
identification systems within the EU as this will  weaken  and  confuse  the
market.


Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected under copyright for  a  limited
period of time. After the term of protection has expired, a work falls  into
the public domain and can be freely used by anyone (in accordance  with  the
applicable  national  rules  on  moral  rights).  The  Berne  Convention[34]
requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after  the  death  of  the
author. The EU rules extend this term of protection to 70  years  after  the
death of the author (as do many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram  producers,  the
term provided for in the EU rules  also  extend  20  years  beyond  what  is
mandated in international agreements, providing for a term of protection  of
70 years after the first publication. Performers and producers in the audio-
visual sector, however, do  not  benefit  from  such  an  extended  term  of
protection.

20.   Are the current terms of copyright  protection  still  appropriate  in
the digital environment?

YES. The current protection of 70 years after the demise of  the  author  is
appropriate in the digital environment, considering the timely creative  and
financial investments made by the music publishers. Music  publishing  is  a
long-term business, as  creative  businesses  often  are.  Music  publishers
spend a  lot  of  time  finding  and  creatively  developing  new  acts  and
songwriters. Without ever knowing if it will pay off in the  end.  In  order
to financially support  the  growing  talent,  music  publishers  often  pay
advances and these investments need time to recoup.  When  music  publishers
collect the money worldwide as well as within  the  EU,  the  money  usually
travels very slowly.  It  takes  considerable  time  for  a  hit  to  become
transformed into actual money. Music publishers also spend  a  lot  of  time
and money on tracking the works and making sure the correct sums  have  been
collected on behalf of the writers. In the digital world so many more  songs
are being used and in so many different ways, compared  to  in  the  offline
world. This generates more money to the writers and to the music  publishers
and over a longer period of time. An old work might  suddenly  have  a  “new
life” on YouTube, so the life span of a  work  might  be  considered  to  be
longer in the digital era. Therefore Musikförläggarna consider  the  current
copyright protection to be appropriate.

 III. Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market


Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights  enable  the  use
of   works   and   other   protected   subject-matter,   without   obtaining
authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to  a  certain
extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from  a
novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are  established
in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive  2001/29/EC[35].



Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU  copyright  laws  have  to
respect   international   law[36].   In   accordance   with    international
obligations, the EU acquis requires  that  limitations  and  exceptions  can
only be applied in certain special  cases  which  do  not  conflict  with  a
normal exploitation  of  the  work  or  other  subject  matter  and  do  not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.


Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in  EU  law  is
exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights  harmonised  at
EU level)[37], these limitations and exceptions are often  optional[38],  in
the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation  as
many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the  formulation  of  certain
of the limitations and exceptions is  general  enough  to  give  significant
flexibility to the  Member  States  as  to  how,  and  to  what  extent,  to
implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth  noting  that
not all  of  the  limitations  and  exceptions  included  in  the  EU  legal
framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy  terms  and
in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single  Market.



In addition, in the same  manner  that  the  definition  of  the  rights  is
territorial (i.e. has an effect only within  the  territory  of  the  Member
State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to  the  rights  is
territorial too (so an act that is covered  by  an  exception  in  a  Member
State "A" may still require the authorisation of  the  rightholder  once  we
move to the Member State "B")[39].


The cross-border effect  of  limitations  and  exceptions  also  raises  the
question of fair compensation of rightholders.  In  some  instances,  Member
States are obliged to compensate rightholders  for  the  harm  inflicted  on
them by a limitation or  exception  to  their  rights.  In  other  instances
Member States  are  not  obliged,  but  may  decide,  to  provide  for  such
compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering  a mechanism  of  fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books  are  used
for illustration in an online course given  by  an  university  in  a Member
State "A" and the students are in a Member State "B") then there would  also
be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level  of  that
compensation and who should pay it.


Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised:  what
is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and  Member  States’  regulatory
frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify  that  certain  uses  are
covered  by  an  exception  or  to  confirm  that  for  certain   uses   the
authorisation of rightholders  is  required)?  The  main  question  here  is
whether a greater degree of flexibility can be  introduced  in  the  EU  and
Member  States  regulatory  framework  while  ensuring  the  required  legal
certainty,  including  for  the  functioning  of  the  Single  Market,   and
respecting the EU's international obligations.


21. Are there problems arising from  the  fact  that  most  limitations  and
exceptions provided in the EU copyright  directives  are  optional  for  the
Member States?


NO. From our perspective we cannot say that the  different  limitations  and
exceptions in different Member States have caused any problems. It does  not
affect the licensing of online rights in a way that is worth mentioning.


22. Should some/all of the exceptions be  made  mandatory  and,  if  so,  is
there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such exceptions?


NO. As we do not perceive this as a problem, (please see answer to  question
21 above) it would be unnecessary to take such measures as  a  higher  level
of harmonisation. The expectations that differ among members states are  due
to cultural and historical differences and  do  not  cause  a  problem.  The
limitations that do affect the licensing are harmonised all through Europe.


23. Should any new limitations and exceptions be added to  or  removed  from
the existing catalogue? Please explain by referring to specific cases.


Any change of the current catalogue must first  be  carefully  examined  and
analysed on the effects on Internal Market, and must ensue in good  economic
result. It goes without saying that it must be applicable to the Three  Step
Test.


24. Independently from the questions above, is there a need to  provide  for
a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  EU  regulatory  framework  for
limitations and exceptions?


NO. Please see answers to question 21 and 22.


25. If yes, what would be the best  approach  to  provide  for  flexibility?
(e.g. interpretation by national courts and the ECJ, periodic  revisions  of
the directives, interpretations by  the  Commission,  built-in  flexibility,
e.g. in the form of a fair-use  or  fair  dealing  provision  /  open  norm,
etc.)? Please explain indicating what would be the relative  advantages  and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its  possible  effects  on  the
functioning of the Internal Market.


-


26.  Does  the  territoriality  of  limitations  and  exceptions,  in   your
experience, constitute a problem?


NO.


27. In the event that limitations and  exceptions  established  at  national
level were to have cross-border effect, how should  the  question  of  “fair
compensation”  be  addressed,  when  such  compensation  is  part   of   the
exception? (e.g. who pays whom, where?)


As it is only obligatory when it comes to the  fair  compensation  principle
with regards to the private copying exception in the EU Copyright  Directive
and leaves the rest of the exceptions at the discretion of EU Member  States
we do not consider this a case of great impact on cross-border  issues.  The
question of who pays whom shall of course follow the CJEU decision  Padawan;
fair compensation should take place where the harm is done.


Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national  law
a  range  of  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the  benefit  of   publicly
accessible libraries, educational establishments and  museums,  as  well  as
archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts  of  preservation  and
archiving[40] and  enable  on-site  consultation  of  the  works  and  other
subject matter in the  collections  of  such  institutions[41].  The  public
lending (under an  exception  or  limitation)  by  these  establishments  of
physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the  Rental
and Lending Directive[42].

Questions arise as to whether the current  framework  continues  to  achieve
the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or  updated  to
cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as  to  the
effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works  and
other  subject  matter  and  as  to  the  prejudice  this   may   cause   to
rightholders. The  role  of  licensing  and  possible  framework  agreements
between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving


The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in  the
collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,  records,  or  films)  –
the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works -  may
involve the creation of another copy/ies of these  works  or  other  subject
matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their  national  laws
allowing for the making of  such  preservation  copies.  The  scope  of  the
exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type  of
beneficiary establishments, the types  of  works/subject-matter  covered  by
the exception, the mode of copying and the number of  reproductions  that  a
beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status  of  new
types of preservation activities (e.g.  harvesting  and  archiving  publicly
available web content) is often uncertain.


28. (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when trying to use an  exception  to  preserve
and archive specific works or other subject matter in your collection?


n/a


 (b) [In particular if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems with the use by libraries, educational  establishments,  museum  or
archives of the preservation exception?


NO. All these areas are covered by exceptions  in  our  territory.  However,
loans from libraries to general public is remunerated by the  government  in
Sweden. However it is principally wrong that such remuneration is given  not
to all right owners,  but  only  to  the  authors.  In  standard  publishing
agreements for music, the music publisher controls and handles the right  to
make copies and to distribute the work; therefore such  remuneration  should
be  split  between  these  parties  in  accordance  with  their  contractual
agreements.


29. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?


If there were to be problems, we would try  to  solve  them  by  negotiating
about a fair compensation with  the  part  wanting  to  be  included  by  an
exception. This specific problem described in 28 (b) must have  been  caused
by lack of information by those who have designed the  remuneration  scheme.
The easiest way to handle this should be to renew negotiation.


30. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary  institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?


Our view is that no legislative solution is needed.


31. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


No other solution needed.


Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for  the  consultation  of  works
and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via
dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the  purpose
of research and private study. The online consultation of works  and  other
subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the  premises
of the library)  requires  authorisation  and  is  generally  addressed  in
agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some  argue  that
the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility  to,  and
the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

32  (a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  institutional  user:]  Have  you
experienced specific problems when  trying  to  negotiate  agreements  with
rights holders that enable you to provide remote access,  including  across
borders,  to your collections (or parts thereof) for purposes  of  research
and private study?

n/a

 (b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:] Have  you  experienced
specific problems when trying to consult, including across  borders,  works
and other subject-matter held in the collections of  institutions  such  as
universities and national libraries when you are not on the premises of the
institutions in question?

n/a

 (c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with institutional  users  that  enable  those  institutions  to
provide remote access, including across borders,  to  the  works  or  other
subject-matter in their collections, for purposes of research  and  private
study?

No, we have not negotiated agreements with  institutional  users.  Also  see
answer to § 36c.

33. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By negotiating between the parties, not via legislation.

34. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary institutions  should
be covered and under which conditions?


Our view is that no legislative solution is needed.

35. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?


No other solution needed.


E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of  works  (i.e.
books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to  their  users.  Recent  technological
developments have made it technically  possible  for  libraries  to  provide
users with temporary access to digital content, such as  e-books,  music  or
films via networks. Under the current legal  framework,  libraries  need  to
obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to  organise  such  e-lending
activities.  In  various  Member  States,  publishers  and   libraries   are
currently experimenting  with  different  business  models  for  the  making
available of works online, including direct supply of e-books  to  libraries
by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

36. (a) [In particular if you are a library:] Have you experienced  specific
problems when trying  to  negotiate  agreements  to  enable  the  electronic
lending (e-lending), including across borders, of books or  other  materials
held in your collection?

n/a

(b) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  when  trying  to  borrow  books   or   other   materials
electronically (e-lending),  including  across  borders,  from  institutions
such as public libraries?

n/a

(c) [In  particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  negotiated
agreements with libraries to enable them to lend books  or  other  materials
electronically, including across borders?

NO, we have not yet negotiated agreements with such institutional users  for
this specific augmentation of rights for institutions to be able to  provide
for remote access. The only way to solve this –  probably  growing  –  usage
and problem is through direct negotiations between the institutions and  the
right owners, music publishers included. It is obvious that this  area  must
be negotiated and found  a  solution  to,  as  corresponding  solutions  and
agreements  already  exist  with  commercial  actors,  which  have  lead  to
advantageous outcome for all involved. A  legislative  solution  for  public
authorities (such as libraries) clearing this matter  would  be  destructive
for an already well functioning and growing market.

37. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

Please see answer to question 36 c above.

The following two questions are relevant both to this point (n° 3)  and  the
previous one (n° 2).

38. [In particular if you are an institutional user:]  What  differences  do
you see in the management of  physical  and  online  collections,  including
providing access to your subscribers? What problems have you encountered?

n/a

39. [In particular if you are a right holder:] What difference  do  you  see
between libraries’ traditional activities such as  on-premises  consultation
or public  lending  and  activities  such  as  off-premises  (online,  at  a
distance) consultation and e-lending? What problems have you encountered?

Problems from e.g. e-lending are limited so far.  Should  specific  problems
arise, these can be solved by negotiated solutions  between  rights  holders
and users, such as licensing (either directly negotiated by  rights  holders
or via CMOs). In our view, negotiations between  rights  holders  and  users
are more flexible and quicker achieved than legislation  and  therefore  the
preferred option. Whatever solution, it is important to make sure  that  all
rights holders receive adequate and satisfactory remuneration.


Mass digitisation

The term “mass digitisation”  is  normally  used  to  refer  to  efforts  by
institutions such as libraries and archives  to  digitise  (e.g.  scan)  the
entire content or part of their collections with an  objective  to  preserve
these collections and, normally, to  make  them  available  to  the  public.
Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part  of
the 20th century or whole collections of pictures of historical value.  This
matter has been partly addressed at the EU  level  by  the  2011  Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on key principles  on  the  digitisation  and  making
available of out of commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found  in
the normal channels  of  commerce),  which  is  aiming  to  facilitate  mass
digitisation efforts (for books  and  learned  journals)  on  the  basis  of
licence agreements between libraries and similar  cultural  institutions  on
the  one  hand  and  the  collecting  societies  representing  authors   and
publishers on the  other[43].  Provided  the  required  funding  is  ensured
(digitisation projects are extremely expensive),  the  result  of  this  MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found  only  in  the  archives
of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available  online  to
everyone. The MoU is based on  voluntary  licences  (granted  by  Collective
Management Organisations on the basis of  the  mandates  they  receive  from
authors and publishers). Some Member States may need  to  enact  legislation
to  ensure  the  largest  possible  effect  of  such   licences   (e.g.   by
establishing in legislation a presumption of representation of  a collecting
society  or  the  recognition  of  an  “extended  effect”  to  the  licences
granted)[44].

40. [In particular if you are an institutional user, engaging or wanting  to
engage  in  mass  digitisation  projects,  a  right  holder,  a   collective
management organisation:] Would it be necessary in  your  country  to  enact
legislation to ensure that the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the  agreements
concluded between libraries and collecting  societies)  have  a cross-border
effect so that out of commerce works can be accessed across the EU?

NO OPINION

41. Would it be  necessary  to  develop  mechanisms,  beyond  those  already
agreed  for  other  types  of  content  (e.g.  for  audio-  or  audio-visual
collections, broadcasters’ archives)?

We are in principle positive to arrangements that open up for  accessibility
to so called “out  of  commerce  works”.  Whatever  solution  to  this  must
however take into consideration that the meaning of the expression  “out  of
commerce works” is quite different if you compare traditional textbooks  and
music (in print and/or recorded). This must  be  taken  into  consideration;
music has a long life!


Teaching

Directive  2001/29/EC[45]  enables  Member  States  to  implement  in  their
national  legislation  limitations  and  exceptions  for  the   purpose   of
illustration for non-commercial teaching. Such  exceptions  would  typically
allow a teacher to use parts of or full  works  to  illustrate  his  course,
e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or of newspaper  articles
in the classroom or by showing protected content on a  smart  board  without
having to obtain authorisation from the right holders. The open  formulation
of this (optional) provision allows for rather different  implementation  at
Member States level.  The  implementation  of  the  exception  differs  from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States  providing  instead
a framework for the licensing of content for certain educational uses.  Some
argue that the law should provide  for  better  possibilities  for  distance
learning and study at home.

42.(a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer  or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to  use  works  or
other  subject-matter  for  illustration  for  teaching,  including   across
borders?

n/a

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used for illustration for teaching, including across borders?

The principle answer is NO. The music publishers receive  some  remuneration
for use within the  education  system  in  Sweden  through  Bonus  Copyright
Access. However the limits for what can be used or  not  used  are  far  too
often overruled; despite agreements have been  based  on  legislation.   The
music industry suffers heavily from such violation.

43.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By negotiating with the party concerned.

44.What mechanisms exist in the  market  place  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for illustration for teaching purposes? How successful are they?

BONUS COPYRIGHT ACCESS. Successful

45. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements? Which activities of the beneficiary  institutions  should
be covered and under what conditions?


Our view is that no legislative solution is needed.

46.If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

Please see answer to question 33 above.


Research

Directive  2001/29/EC[46]  enables  Member  States  to  choose  whether   to
implement in their national laws  a  limitation  for  the  purpose  of  non-
commercial scientific research. The  open  formulation  of  this  (optional)
provision allows for  rather  different  implementations  at  Member  States
level.

47.(a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer  or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced specific problems when trying to  use  works  or
other  subject  matter  in  the  context  of  research  projects/activities,
including across borders?

n/a

(b) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting from the way in which works  or  other  subject-
matter are used in the context of  research  projects/activities,  including
across borders?

NO.

48.If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

-

49.What mechanisms exist in the Member  States  to  facilitate  the  use  of
content for research purposes? How successful are they?

BONUS COPYRIGHT ACCESS and COPYSWEDE. Successful.

Disabilities

Directive  2001/29/EC[47]  provides  for  an  exception/limitation  for  the
benefit  of  people  with  a disability.  The  open  formulation   of   this
(optional) provision allows for rather different implementations  at  Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been  launched  to
increase the accessibility of works and  other  subject-matter  for  persons
with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of  works  published  in
special formats and facilitating  their  distribution  across  the  European
Union) [48].

The Marrakesh Treaty[49] has been adopted to facilitate access to  published
works for persons who are  blind,  visually  impaired,  or  otherwise  print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that  allows
organisations for the  blind  to  produce,  distribute  and  make  available
accessible  format  copies  to  visually  impaired   persons   without   the
authorisation of the  rightholders.  The  EU  and  its  Member  States  have
started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may  require  the  adoption
of certain provisions at  EU  level  (e.g.  to  ensure  the  possibility  to
exchange accessible format copies across borders).


50(a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  person  with  a  disability  or  an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:] Have  you  experienced
problems with accessibility to content, including  across  borders,  arising
from Member States’ implementation of this exception?


n/a


(b) [In particular  if  you  are  an  organisation  providing  services  for
persons   with   disabilities:]   Have   you   experienced   problems   when
distributing/communicating works published in  special  formats  across  the
EU?


n/a


(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific  problems  resulting  from  the  application  of   limitations   or
exceptions allowing for the distribution/communication  of  works  published
in special formats, including across borders?


NO.

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/content mining/data analytics[50] are  different  terms
used to describe increasingly important techniques  used  in  particular  by
researchers for the exploration of vast amounts of existing texts  and  data
(e.g., journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of software  or
other automated processes, an analysis is made of relevant  texts  and  data
in order to obtain new insights, patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining  are  either  freely  accessible  on  the
internet  or  accessible  through  subscriptions  to   e.g.   journals   and
periodicals that give access to the databases of publishers. A copy is  made
of the relevant texts and  data  (e.g.  on  browser  cache  memories  or  in
computers RAM memories or onto the hard disk of a computer),  prior  to  the
actual analysis. Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works  or
other subject matter, it is  necessary  to  obtain  authorisation  from  the
right holders for the making of such copies unless  such  authorisation  can
be implied (e.g. content accessible to general public  without  restrictions
on the internet, open access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are covered  by
the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of  Directive  2001/29/EC.
Others consider that text and data mining  activities  should  not  even  be
seen as covered by copyright. None of this is  clear,  in  particular  since
text and data mining does not consist only of a single method,  but  can  be
undertaken in several different ways. Important questions also remain as  to
whether the main problems arising  in  relation  to  this  issue  go  beyond
copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain the  authorisation  to
use content) and relate rather to the need to  obtain  “access”  to  content
(i.e. being able to use e.g. commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results. At the same time, practical solutions to facilitate text  and  data
mining  of  subscription-based  scientific   content   were   presented   by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”[51].  In  the  context  of
these discussions, other stakeholders argued  that  no  additional  licences
should be required to mine  material  to  which  access  has  been  provided
through a subscription agreement and considered  that  a specific  exception
for text and data mining should be introduced,  possibly  on  the  basis  of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

53 (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer  or  an  institutional
user:] Have you experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when  trying  to
use text or data mining methods, including across borders?


n/a

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing services  based  on  text  or
data mining methods, including across borders?


n/a

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
specific problems resulting  from  the  use  of  text  and  data  mining  in

NO.

This does not concern the music business to a degree worth analysing.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can copy, use  and
distribute content at little to no financial cost.  As  a  consequence,  new
types of online activities are developing rapidly, including the  making  of
so-called “user-generated content”. While users can create totally  original
content, they can also  take  one  or  several  pre-existing  works,  change
something in the work(s), and upload the result  on  the  Internet  e.g.  to
platforms and blogs[52]. User-generated content (UGC)  can  thus  cover  the
modification of pre-existing works even  if  the  newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarily require a creative effort and results from  merely
adding, subtracting or associating some pre-existing content with other pre-
existing content. This kind of activity is not “new” as such.  However,  the
development of social networking and social media sites  that  enable  users
to share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such activities  and
increased the potential economic impact for those holding rights in the pre-
existing works. Re-use is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  a technically  and
artistically  adept  elite.  With  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  new
technologies, re-use is open to  all,  at  no  cost.  This  in  turn  raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom  of  expression
and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the  framework  of  the
"Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No consensus was  reached  among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to  be  addressed  or  the
results or even the definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide range  of  views
were presented as to the best way to respond to this  phenomenon.  One  view
was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in  particular  non-
commercial activities by individuals  such  as  combining  existing  musical
works with videos, sequences of  photos,  etc.  Another  view  was  that  no
legislative change is needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes  are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between  rightholders  and
platforms as well as micro-licences concluded between rightholders  and  the
users generating the content. In any  event,  practical  solutions  to  ease
user-generated content and facilitate micro-licensing for small  users  were
pledged by  rightholders  across  different  sectors  as  a  result  of  the
“Licences for Europe” discussions[53].

58.(a)  [In  particular  if  you  are  an  end  user/consumer:]   Have   you
experienced problems when trying to use pre-existing works or other  subject
matter  to  disseminate  new  content  on  the  Internet,  including  across
borders?


n/a

(b) [In particular if you are a  service  provider:]  Have  you  experienced
problems when users  publish/disseminate  new  content  based  on  the  pre-
existing works or  other  subject-matter  through  your  service,  including
across borders?


n/a

(c) [In particular  if  you  are  a  right  holder:]  Have  you  experienced
problems resulting from the way the users are using  pre-existing  works  or
other subject-matter to disseminate new content on the  Internet,  including
across borders?

NO. But this needs to be explored further. However,  we  have  to  date  not
experienced problems resulting  from  the  way  the  users  are  using  pre-
existing works. The reason is simply that UGC is not a  new  phenomenon.  It
is a sort of extension of the synchronisation market. UGC is to be  look  at
as a derivative work and there are licensing  solutions  in  place  to  deal
with derivative works.  Rights holders have been  developing,  and  continue
doing so, licensing solutions for the so-called  UGC  and  for  small  scale
licensing. The way licences  are  being  offered  and  the  scope  of  these
licences makes it easy and swift for users to  get  a  licence  for  musical
works. In the music –publishing sector  UGC  is  mostly  on  sites  such  as
YouTube and in our territory (our PRS) STIM  and  YouTube  recently  entered
into an agreement covering synchronisation rights on behalf of  songwriters,
as well as versions of their songs. We do not believe that  UGC  raises  any
new specific issues and even if it did,  we  think  that  the  current  EU’s
Copyright law is well equipped to address them.

59 (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or  a  right  holder:]
Have you experienced problems when trying to ensure that the work  you  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing  works)  is  properly  identified  for
online use? Are proprietary systems sufficient in this context?

NO. Created works are sufficiently  identified.  Musikförläggarna  does  not
consider that legislative intervention is needed.

(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
possibilities for users that are  publishing/disseminating  the  works  they
have created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through  your  service  to
properly identify these works for online use?


n/a

60. (a) [In particular if you are an end user/consumer or a right  holder):]
Have you experienced problems when trying to be remunerated for the  use  of
the work you have created (on the basis of pre-existing works)?

NO. Agreements such as the YouTube mentioned above show that it is  possible
to ensure that creators receive fair compensation for  the  use  of  a  work
created out of an existing work.

(b)  [In  particular  if  you  are  a  service  provider:]  Do  you  provide
remuneration schemes for users publishing/disseminating the works they  have
created (on the basis of pre-existing works) through your service?


n/a

61. If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

By negotiating and licensing between the parties, not via legislation.

62. If your view is that a legislative solution is  needed,  what  would  be
its main elements?  Which  activities  should  be  covered  and  under  what
conditions?

No legislative solution needed.

63. If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would it be?

An UGC should legally be considered to be a derivative work  and  there  are
rules already in place to deal with derivative works. All right  holders  to
derivative works must obtain a license to  use  the  pre-existing  material.
Musikförläggarna sees no reason  to  grant  an  exception  for  UGC  in  the
copyright law but we must instead  continue  to  license  these  works,  and
improve the effectiveness of the licensing.


  IV. Private copying and reprography


Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement  in  their  national
legislation exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right  for  copies
made for private use and photocopying[54]. Levies  are  charges  imposed  at
national level on goods typically  used  for  such  purposes  (blank  media,
recording equipment, photocopying machines, mobile  listening  devices  such
as  mp3/mp4  players,  computers,  etc.)  with  a   view   to   compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies  are  made  without  their
authorisation by certain categories of persons (i.e. natural persons  making
copies  for  their  private  use)  or  through  use  of  certain   technique
(i.e. reprography). In that context, levies are important for rightholders.


With the constant developments in digital technology,  the  question  arises
as  to  whether  the  copying  of  files  by  consumers/end-users  who  have
purchased content online - e.g. when a person has bought  an  MP3  file  and
goes on to store multiple copies of that file (in her computer,  her  tablet
and her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should  trigger,  the  application
of private copying levies. It is argued that, in some  cases,  these  levies
may indeed be claimed by rightholders whether or not the  licence  fee  paid
by the service provider already covers copies made by  the  end  user.  This
approach could potentially lead to  instances  of  double  payments  whereby
levies could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees[55][56].

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or not of  levies
to certain types  of  cloud-based  services  such  as  personal  lockers  or
personal video recorders.

64. In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the  scope  and
application of the private copying and  reprography  exceptions[57]  in  the
digital environment?

NO need for further clarification. The  scope  and  application  of  private
copying and reprography exceptions is currently being clarified by the  CJEU
and at national level. We have a  court  case  going  on  in  Sweden,  where
Copyswede sued Sony Mobile for levies to be  paid  for  smart  phones  (Sony
Mobiles Walkman phones). The judgement is expected in late February 2104.

The CJEU has confirmed that in those countries where consumers  are  allowed
by law to  make  private  copies  of  copyright  protected  content,  rights
holders have a right to be fairly compensated for these  reproductions.  The
CJEU have made clear that levies  should  be  calculated  according  to  the
assumed  harm  sustained  by  rights  holders  by  the  private  copying  in
question.

65. Should digital copies made by end users  for  private  purposes  in  the
context of a service that has been licensed by rightholders, and  where  the
harm  to  the  rightholder  is  minimal,  be  subject  to  private   copying
levies?[58]

YES. If a license fee has already been paid for the use of a  service,  then
no additional private copying levy  is  due.   This  should  not  be  deemed
applicable when there are two  separate  uses  but  only  one  of  which  is
licensed. Double payment for double use is not double payment.

66. How would changes in levies with respect to the  application  to  online
services (e.g. services based on cloud  computing  allowing,  for  instance,
users to have copies  on  different  devices)  impact  the  development  and
functioning of new  business  models  on  the  one  hand  and  rightholders’
revenue on the other?

It is the opinion of Musikförläggarna  that  the  cloud  service  should  be
licensed and hence not to subject to levies, but the different devices  used
for accessing the content in  the  cloud  services  and  where  the  private
copying is taking place should be levied.


67. Would you see an added value in making levies visible  on  the  invoices
for products subject to levies?[59]

YES. In our territory the issue of levies have  been  much  debated  in  the
media and often  enough  facts  are  being  wrongly  presented.  Educational
measures should be envisaged and transparency is an important step.

Diverging national systems  levy  different  products  and  apply  different
tariffs. This results in obstacles to the  free  circulation  of  goods  and
services in the  Single  Market.  At  the  same  time,  many  Member  States
continue to allow the indiscriminate application of private  copying  levies
to all transactions irrespective of the person to whom the  product  subject
to a levy is sold (e.g. private person or business). In  that  context,  not
all Member States have  ex  ante  exemption  and/or  ex  post  reimbursement
schemes which could remedy these situations and reduce the number  of  undue
payments[60].

68. Have you  experienced  a  situation  where  a  cross-border  transaction
resulted in undue levy payments, or duplicate payments of the same levy,  or
other obstacles to the free movement of goods or services?

NO OPINION

69.What percentage of products subject to a levy is sold  to  persons  other
than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private  copying?  Do
any of those transactions  result  in  undue  payments?  Please  explain  in
detail the example you provide  (type  of  products,  type  of  transaction,
stakeholders, etc.).

-

70.Where such undue  payments  arise,  what  percentage  of  trade  do  they
affect?  To  what  extent  could  a  priori  exemptions   and/or   ex   post
reimbursement schemes existing in some Member  States  help  to  remedy  the
situation?

-

71. If you have identified specific problems with  the  current  functioning
of the levy system, how would these problems best be solved?

NO OPINION.

   V. Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers  a  number  of
exclusive rights and, in the  case  of  performers  whose  performances  are
fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few  provisions  in  the
EU  copyright  law  governing  the  transfer  of  rights  from  authors   or
performers to producers[61] or determining who the owner of  the  rights  is
when the work or other subject matter  is  created  in  the  context  of  an
employment contract[62]. This is an area that has  been  traditionally  left
for Member States to regulate  and  there  are  significant  differences  in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between  different
sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns  continue  to  be  raised  that  authors  and  performers  are  not
adequately remunerated, in particular but  not  solely,  as  regards  online
exploitation. Many consider that  the  economic  benefit  of  new  forms  of
exploitation is not  being  fairly  shared  along  the  whole  value  chain.
Another commonly raised issue concerns  contractual  practices,  negotiation
mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of  rights,  buy-out  clauses  and  the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some  stakeholders  are  of  the
opinion that rules at  national  level  do  not  suffice  to  improve  their
situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

72. [In particular if  you  are  an  author/performer:]  What  is  the  best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms)  to  ensure  that  you  receive  an
adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and performances?

Effective copyright systems and effective measures on IPR enforcement;  this
gives the best chance of receiving a fair remuneration for the  exploitation
of  works  and  performances  both  when  negotiated   by   author/performer
themselves and by representatives such as PROs.

73. Is there a need to act  at  the  EU  level  (for  instance  to  prohibit
certain clauses in contracts)?

NO. Contracts should be negotiated by parties concerned and not  be  decided
on a EU level.

74. If you consider that the current rules are  not  effective,  what  would
you suggest to address the shortcomings you identify?

-

  VI. Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE[63] provides for a harmonised framework for  the  civil
enforcement  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  copyright   and
related rights. The Commission  has  consulted  broadly  on  this  text[64].
Concerns have been raised as to whether some of  its  provisions  are  still
fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the digital age. On the  one
hand, the current measures seem to be insufficient  to  deal  with  the  new
challenges brought by the dissemination of digital content on the  internet;
on the other hand, there are concerns  about  the  current  balance  between
enforcement of copyright  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  in
particular the right for a  private  life  and  data  protection.  While  it
cannot be contested  that enforcement measures should  always  be  available
in case  of  infringement  of  copyright,  measures  could  be  proposed  to
strengthen respect for copyright when the infringed content is  used  for  a
commercial purpose[65]. One means to do this could be to  clarify  the  role
of intermediaries in the IP infrastructure[66].  At  the  same  time,  there
could be clarification of the safeguards for respect  of  private  life  and
data protection for private users.

75. Should  the  civil  enforcement  system  in  the  EU  be  rendered  more
efficient  for  infringements  of  copyright  committed  with  a  commercial
purpose?

YES. This needs to be explored further. In the opinion  of  Musikförläggarna
the civil enforcement system in our territory could be  more  efficient  and
effective.  Most  infringement  cases  are  solved  by  alternative  dispute
resolution and settled out of court. This is due to the long time  it  takes
to litigate and also the costs concerned. There might also be  a  difficulty
of identifying and establishing the territorial liability of the  infringer.
It could be useful to establish at EU  level  model  rules  for  fast  track
proceedings for civil  law  cases  concerning  copyright  infringements.  In
relation to damages and injunctions in the 2004  Enforcement  Directive,  we
would appreciate clarification in some aspects. In  particularly  concerning
Article 11 on injunctions and Article 13 on damages, where  there  is  great
inconsistency among Member States, which leads  to  uncertainty  on  how  to
deal with injunctions  and  damages  and  how  to  implement  the  Directive
effective.

76. In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to allow  for
  sufficient  involvement  of  intermediaries  (such  as  Internet   service
providers, advertising  brokers,  payment  service  providers,  domain  name
registrars, etc.)  in  inhibiting  online  copyright  infringements  with  a
commercial purpose? If not, what measures would  be  useful  to  foster  the
cooperation of intermediaries?

NO. As ISPs thrive on the communication of content  and  is  dependent  upon
content for survival, it should be in their interest to be  more  alert  and
take greater responsibilities for the illegal  content  on  their  services.
This is however, not the case in our territory, as we find it  difficult  to
collaborate the ISPs and other intermediaries. It is our opinion  that  they
should be able to prevent illegal activities on their sites,  due  to  their
size, technical access and because they have created  their  business  based
on copyrighted works. We wish for more voluntary agreements  between  rights
holders and ISPs and for the business to  be  self-regulating.  However,  as
that seems to be hard to achieve, as not all ISPs are willing to  cooperate,
we call for legislating. The EU needs  effective  rules  that  impose  clear
obligations for ISPs and other intermediaries to cooperate.

77. Does the current civil  enforcement  framework  ensure  that  the  right
balance is achieved between the right to have one’s copyright respected  and
other rights such as the  protection  of  private  life  and  protection  of
personal data?

YES. However, sometimes the music  publisher  might  find  it  difficult  to
prove infringement without the information that they are seeking  under  the
right of information. In order to  ensure  that  music  publishers  are  not
prevented from gathering  evidence  of  online  copyright  infringement,  we
would like to be confirmed that collecting and processing IP  addresses  for
the purposes of collecting evidence of infringement is not  contrary  to  EU
Law. We encourage this to be investigated further and clarified.

 VII. A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has  been  present  in
the copyright debate for quite some time  now,  although  views  as  to  the
merits and the feasibility of such an objective are divided.  A  unified  EU
Copyright Title would totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the  EU
and replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title instead  of
a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the only  manner  in  which  a
truly Single Market for content  protected  by  copyright  can  be  ensured,
while others believe that the same  objective  can  better  be  achieved  by
establishing a higher level of harmonisation while allowing  for  a  certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal systems.

78. Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU  Copyright  Title,
as a means of establishing a consistent framework for rights and  exceptions
to copyright across the EU, as well as a single framework for enforcement?

NO. Fully harmonising the EU copyright laws would imply Member States  might
lose the ability to implement their own cultural values  through  copyright.
Musikförläggarna is of the opinion  that  the  current  system  works  fine,
considering pan-European licences are  already  up  and  running  and  being
granted without a EU Title.


79. Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in the  EU?
Does the current level of difference  among  the  Member  State  legislation
mean that this is a longer term project?

NO. Please see above answer to question 78.


VIII. Other issues

The above questionnaire aims to provide a comprehensive consultation on  the
most important matters relating  to  the  current  EU  legal  framework  for
copyright.  Should  any  important  matters  have  been  omitted,  we  would
appreciate if you could  bring  them  to  our  attention,  so  they  can  be
properly addressed in the future.

80. Are there any other important matters related to the EU legal  framework
for copyright? Please explain  and  indicate  how  such  matters  should  be
addressed.

[17] Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council  of
23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs.
[18] Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.
[19] Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are  holders  of
so-called “neighbouring rights”  in,  respectively,  their  films,  records,
performances and broadcast.  Authors’  content  protected  by  copyright  is
referred to as a “work” or “works”, while content protected by  neighbouring
rights is referred to as “other subject matter”.
[20] The right to “authorise or prohibit direct or  indirect,  temporary  or
permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole  or  in  part”
(see  Art.  2  of  Directive  2001/29/EC)   although   temporary   acts   of
reproduction  of  a  transient  or  incidental  nature  are,  under  certain
conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)  of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[21] The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the  public  by
wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit the making available  to
the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC).
[22] See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football  Dataco  vs  Sportradar)  and
Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related  rights,  and  Case  C-324/09
(L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks.  With  regard  to  jurisdiction  see  also
joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 (Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof)  and  pending
CaseC-441/13 (Pez Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach,  Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).
[23] Injunctive relief is a  temporary  or  permanent  remedy  allowing  the
right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her right.
[24]   Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)  and C-
279/13 (C More entertainment).
[25]  Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd). See
also http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-
cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.
[26] See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.
[27] In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled  that  an  author
cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence  that  allows  downloading
his computer program from his website and using it for an  unlimited  period
of time. The exclusive right  of  distribution  of  a  copy  of  a  computer
program covered by such a licence is exhausted on its first sale.  While  it
is thus admitted that the distribution right may be  subject  to  exhaustion
in case of computer programs offered for download with  the  right  holder’s
consent, the Court was careful to emphasise that it  reached  this  decision
based on the  Computer  Programs  Directive.   It  was  stressed  that  this
exhaustion rule constituted a lex specialis in relation to  the  Information
Society Directive (UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).
[28] For  example,  it  does  not  affect  “domestic”  works  –  i.e.  works
originating in the country imposing the  formalities  as  opposed  to  works
originating in another country.
[29] On the basis  of  Article  3.6  of  the  Directive  2012/28/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  certain
permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly  accessible  online  database  is
currently being set up by the  Office  for  Harmonisation  of  the  Internal
Market (OHIM) for the registration of orphan works.
[30] E.g. the International  Standard  Recording  Code  (ISRC)  is  used  to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)  is  used
to identify books.

[34] Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.
[35] Plus Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases;  Directive
2009/24/EC on the legal  protection  of  computer  programs,  and  Directive
92/100/EC on rental right and lending right.
[36] Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for  the  Protection  of  Literary
and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement (Trade  Related
Intellectual Property Rights) 1994; Article 16(2)  of  the  WIPO  Performers
and Phonograms Treaty (1996); Article 9(2)  of  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty
(1996).
[37] Other than the grandfathering of the  exceptions  of  minor  importance
for analogue uses existing in Member States  at  the  time  of  adoption  of
Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art. 5(3)(o)).
[38] With  the  exception  of  certain  limitations:  (i)  in  the  Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)  Article  5(1)  in
the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan Works Directive.
[39] Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works Directive  (a
mandatory exception to copyright and related rights in the  case  where  the
rightholders are not known or cannot be located) has  been  given  a  cross-
border effect, which means that, for instance, once a literary  work  –  for
instance a novel – is considered an orphan work  in  a  Member  State,  that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States  and  can
be used and accessed in all Member States.
[40] Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.
[41] Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

website:               http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-
commerce/index_en.htm .
[44] France and  Germany  have  already  adopted  legislation  to  back  the
effects of the MoU. The French  act  (LOI  n°  2012-287  du  1er  mars  2012
relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres indisponibles du xxe  siècle)
foresees collective management, unless the author or publisher  in  question
opposes such management. The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung  verwaister  und
vergriffener Werke und einer  weiteren  Änderung  des  Urheberrechtsgesetzes
vom 1. Oktober 2013) contains a legal presumption  of  representation  by  a
collecting society in relation to works whose rightholders are  not  members
of the collecting society.

[52] A typical example could be the “kitchen”  or  “wedding”  video  (adding
one's own video to a pre-existing sound  recording),  or  adding  one's  own
text to a pre-existing photograph. Other examples are  “mash-ups”  (blending
two sound recordings), and reproducing parts of journalistic  work  (report,
review etc.) in a blog.

intermediary  service  providers  established  by  Directive  2000/31/EC  on
electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.
