Public Consultation
on the review of the EU copyright rules

I. Fair remuneration of authors and performers
The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a number of exclusive rights and, in the case of

performers whose performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There are few provisions in the

                                                                                            62
EU copyright law governing the transfer of rights from authors or performers to producers or determining
who the owner of the rights is when the work or other subject matter is created in the context of an employment

        63
contract . This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member States to regulate and there are significant
differences in regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist between different sectors of the creative
industries.


Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are not adequately remunerated, in particular but not
solely, as regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic benefit of new forms of exploitation is
not being fairly shared along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue concerns contractual
practices, negotiation mechanisms, presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the lack of possibility
to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice to improve
their situation and that action at EU level is necessary.

1. [In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best mechanism (or combination of
mechanisms) to ensure that you receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your works and
performances?

[Open question]

A levy (from 4% to 8%) to every Internet subscription, would be fair somehow, for rights loses from users, alike
the "Blank Recording Media" levy, that collecting societies would handle.
