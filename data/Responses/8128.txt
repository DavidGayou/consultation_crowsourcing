Introduction

Contextof the consultation

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet
have reshaped the ways in which content is created,
distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised
for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, anovel,
a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for
institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research
and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content –
for information, education or entertainment purposes –
regardless of geographical borders.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is
for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of
distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to
ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and
enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new
environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these
challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework
stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support
creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single
Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote
cultural diversity.

In its "Communication on Content in the Digital Single Market"1

COM (2012)789 final, 18/12/2012.

the Commission set out two parallel tracks of action:on the one
hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to
modernise the EU copyright legislative framework2

As announced in the Intellectual Property Strategy ' A single
market for Intellectual Property Rights: COM (2011)287 final,
24/05/2011.

"Based on market studies and impact assessment and legal
drafting work"as announced in the Communication (2012)789.

with a view to a decision in 2014 on whether to table
legislative reform proposals, andon the other, to facilitate
practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder
dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid
progress was deemed necessary and possible.

The "Licences for Europe" process has been finalised now4

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders
have put forward in this context and will monitor their
progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four
Working Groups (cross border portability of services,
user-generated content, audiovisual and film heritage and text
and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these
pledges to be a further step in making the user environment
easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes
note of the fact that two groups – user-generated content and
text and data mining – did not reach consensus among
participating stakeholders on either the problems to be
addressed or on the results. The discussions and results of
"Licences for Europe" will be also taken into account in the
context of the review of the legislative framework.

As part of the review process, theCommission is now launching a
public consultation on issues identified in the Communication
on Content in the Digital Single Market, i.e.:"territoriality
in the Internal Market, harmonisation, limitations and
exceptions to copyright in the digital age; fragmentation of
the EU copyright market; and how to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of enforcement while underpinning its legitimacy
in the wider context of copyright reform". As highlighted in the
October 2013 European CouncilConclusions5

EUCO169/13, 24/25 October 2013.

"Providing digital services and content across the single market
requires the establishment of a copyright regime for the digital
age. The Commission will therefore complete its on-going review
of the EU copyright framework in spring 2014. It is important
to modernise Europe's copyright regime and facilitate
licensing, while ensuring a high level protection of
intellectual property rights and taking into account cultural
diversity".

This consultation builds on previous consultations and public
hearings, in particular those on the "Green Paper on copyright
in the knowledge economy"6

COM(2008)
466/3,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2.

, the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual
works"7

COM(2011) 427
final,http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2011/audiovisual_en.htm.

and "Content Online"8

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2009/content_online_en.htm.

. These consultations provided valuable feedback from
stakeholders on a number of questions, on issues as diverse as
the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome
territoriality, exceptions related to the online
disseminationof knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration,
particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by
stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain,
including right holders, distributors, consumers, and
academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the
best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the
Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The
replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of
audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the
Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current
review process.

Rights and the functioning of the Single Market

Why isit not possible to access many online content services
from anywhere in Europe?[The territorial scope of the rights
involved in digital transmissions and the segmentation of the
market through licensing agreements]

Holders of copyright and related rights – e.g. writers, singers,
musicians - do not enjoy a single protection in the EU. Instead,
they are protected on the basis of a bundle of national rights
in each Member State. Those rights have been largely harmonised
by the existing EU Directives. However, differences remain and
the geographical scope of the rights is limited to the
territory of the Member State granting them. Copyright is thus
territorial in the sense that rights are acquired and enforced
on a country-by-country basis under national law9

This principle has been confirmed by the Court of justice on
several occasions.

.

The dissemination of copyright-protected content on the Internet
– e.g. by a music streaming service, or by an online e-book
seller – therefore requires, in principle, anauthorisation for
each national territory in which the content is communicated to
the public. Rightholders are, of course, in a position to grant
a multi-territorial or pan-European licence, such that content
services can be provided in several Member States and across
borders. A number of steps have been taken at EU level to
facilitate multi-territorial licences: the proposal for a
Directive on Collective Rights Management10

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 July2012 on collective management of copyright
and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in
musical works for online uses in the internal market, COM(2012)
372 final.

should significantly facilitate the delivery of
multi-territorial licences in musical works for online
services11

Collective Management Organisations play a significant role in
the management of online rights for musical works in contrast
to the situation where online rights are licensed directly by
right holders such as filmor record producers or by newspaper
or book publishers.

; the structured stakeholder dialogue “Licences for Europe”12

You can find more information on the following website:
http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/.

and market-led developments such as the on-going work in the
Linked Content Coalition13

You can find more information on the following
website:http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/.

.

"Licences for Europe" addressed in particular the specific issue
of cross-border portability, i.e. the ability of consumers
having subscribed to online services in their Member State to
keep accessing them when travelling temporarilyto other Member
States. As a result, representatives of the audio-visual sector
issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue
working towards the further development of cross-border
portability14

See the document “Licences for Europe – tem pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

.

Despite progress, there are continued problems with the
cross-border provision of, and access to, services. These
problems are most obvious to consumers wanting to access
services that are made available in Member States other than
the one in which they live. Not all online services are
available in all Member States and consumers face problems when
trying to access such services across borders. In some
instances, even if the “same” service is available in all
Member States, consumers cannot access the service across
borders (they can only access their “national” service, and if
they try to access the "same" service in another Member State
they are redirected to the one designated for their country of
residence).

This situation may in part stem from the territoriality of
rights and difficulties associated with the clearing of rights
in different territories. Contractual clauses in licensing
agreements between right holders and distributors and/or
between distributors and end users may also be at the origin of
some of the problems (denial of access, redirection).

The main issue at stake here is, therefore, whether further
measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led
solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium term15

For possible long term measures such as the establishment of a
European Copyright Code (establishing a single title) see
section VII of this consultation document.

to increase the cross-border availability of content services in
the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level of
protection for right holders.

[In particular if you arean end user/consumer:]Have you faced
problems when trying to access online services in an EU Member
State other than the one in which you live?

YES- Please provide examples indicating the Member State, the
sector and the type of content concerned (e.g. premium content
such as certain films and TV series, audio-visual content in
general, music, e-books, magazines, journals and newspapers,
games, applications and other software)

Member state = UK. Non premium content such as video extracts
embedded in newspaper web sites. “Premium” content such as
previously broadcasted TV shows from the BBC or Channel 4
firms.

Also paying for goods with a credit card which is not registered
in the same member state as the seller sometimes is not
possible. Registering with content providers is sometimes not
possible as they don't expect postcodes and so on from other
states.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you faced
problems when seeking to provide online services across borders
inthe EU?

YES- Please explain whether such problems, in your
experience, are related to copyright or to other issues (e.g.
business decisions relating to the cost of providing services
across borders, compliance with other laws such as consumer
protection)? Please provide examples indicating the Member
State, the sector and the type of content concerned (e.g.
premium content such as certain films and TV series,
audio-visual content in general, music, e-books, magazines,
journals and newspapers, games, applications and other
software).

(opinion only) 2 factors – if a member of another EU state
downloads my copyrighted material inappropriately, is there a
realistic chance I can obtain remittance / compensation for
this act? No. Secondly, the EU has a large and growing
population. Can I realistically afford the infrastructure to
provide my copyrighted content to them all? It is cheaper and
easier to restrict downloads to the local community of my own
EU member state.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if youare a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]How often are you asked to grant
multi-territorial licences? Please indicate, if possible, the
number of requests per year and provide examples indicating the
Member State, the sector and the type of content concerned.

[Open question]

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If you have identified problems in the answers to any of the
questions above – what would be the best way to tackle them?

[Openquestion]

As a consumer, if a publisher restricts content of (eg TV shows)
based on my location, this is an irritation. I can easily obtain
the content by using a 'proxy' service, which dupes the
publisher into thinking I am downloading content from
theirmember state, or I can find an illegal copy of the
material in a Torrent site and download from there. Publishers
need to accept that information they release on their web pages
should be freely available to consumers from all member states.
If downloads need to be controlled this should be made on a
user by user basis, not a member-state by member-state basis.
Current IP-based control techniques do not work in any case.

Publishers should expect that consumers will be located overseas
and may wish to consume and pay for their goods using
international credit cards (eg VISA) registered in other member
states. They should be prepared for delivery addresses from
other states. This is a big opportunity for them.

It is not appropriate that we have different 'versions' of the
internet, IE where content differs depending upon the assumed
location of the consumer. Perhaps legislation or guidelines
would help this. Content owners need to feel confident that
their rights will be upheld in other member states. Perhaps EU
wide mechanisms or a copyright violation insurance would help
this.

[In particular if you are a right holder or a collective
management organisation:]Are there reasons why, even in cases
where you hold all the necessary rights for all the territories
in question, you would still find it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions on a service provider (in
order, for instance, to ensure that access to certain content
is not possible in certain European countries)?

YES– Please explain by giving examples

NO

Provided there was not undue undue bureaucracy associated with
providing content for other territories, nor a requirement to
translate or reformat published works.

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are e.g. a broadcaster or a service
provider:]Are there reasons why, even in cases where you have
acquired all the necessary rights for all the territories in
question, you would stillfind it necessary or justified to
impose territorial restrictions onthe service recipient (in
order for instance, to redirect the consumer to a different
website than the one he is trying to access)?

YES– Please explain by giving examples

As mentioned.If I am the BBC, for example, I know that most of
the TV licensing payers live in the UK. Therefore if I provide
TV-related content, such as previously broadcasted shows, I
wish this to be primarily available for the local audience:
those who pay and those who can cause the most damage to the
company if the service is poor.

Technically transmission of video to non-local consumers is
likely to be slower and thus take up more of the publisher's
resources. Additionally the number of consumers will be much
larger without territorial restrictions, further burdening the
publisher's technical infrastructure.

 NO

 NO OPINION

Do you think that further measures (legislative or
non-legislative, including market-led solutions) are needed at
EU level to increase thecross-border availability of content
services in the Single Market, while ensuring an adequate level
of protection for right holders?

YES– Please explain

It benefits all of us if content is available freely throughout
the EU, and if publishers changetheir mindset to expect
consumers to consume from throughout the EU.

It is primarily a question of education and trust building.
Content owners need to have faith that they will receive their
fair dues, content distributors need to expect that consumers
will come from all EU states and that they can and should
provide content to them.

Non-legislative measures in these areas would be required. Using
key distributors and content owners to lead the way and set an
example would help.

Legislative measuressuch as the recent “cookie” law, I feel,
achieved little except more red-tape for the producers and more
annoying pop-ups for the consumers.

 NO – Please explain

Isthere a need for more clarity as regards the scope of what
needs to be authorised (or not) in digital transmissions?[The
definition of the rights involved in digital transmissions]

The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related
rights in thedigital environment is largely established by
Directive 2001/29/EC16

Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects
of copyright and related rights in the information society.

on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
rights in the information society. OtherEU directives in
thisfield that are relevant in the online environment are those
relating to the protection of software17

Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer
programs.

and databases18

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

.

Directive 2001/29/ECharmonises the rights of authors and
neighbouring rightholders19

Film and record producers, performers and broadcasters are
holders of so-called “neighbouring rights” in, respectively,
their films, records, performances and broadcast. Authors’
content protected by copyright is referred to as a “work” or
“works”, while content protected by neighbouring rights is
referred to as “other subject matter”.

which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of
works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g.
a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital
networks.

The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the
reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the
making of copies20

The right to“authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary
or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole
or in part” (see Art. 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC) although
temporary acts of reproduction of a transient or incidental
nature are, under certain conditions, excluded (see art. 5(1)
of Directive 2001/29/EC).

, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the
uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of
making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a
userdownloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication
to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to
authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital
networks21

The right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the
public by wire or wireless means and to authorise or prohibit
the making available to the public “on demand” (see Art. 3 of
Directive 2001/29/EC).

. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions
and both need to be cleared.

The act of “making available”

Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neitherwhatis covered by the
making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by
the public, the actual reception by the public) norwherethe act
of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions
if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise
however when the transmission covers several territories and
rights need to be cleared (does the act of "making available"
happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the
countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each
of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?).
The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the
“targeting” of a certain Member State's public22

See in particular Case C-173/11 (Football Dataco vs Sportradar)
and Case C-5/11 (Donner) for copyright and related rights, and
Case C-324/09 (L’Oréal vs eBay) for trademarks. With regard to
jurisdiction see also joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09
(Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof) and pending CaseC-441/13 (Pez
Hejduk); see however, adopting a different approach, Case
C-170/12 (Pinckney vs KDG Mediatech).

. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which
has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which
are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service
provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific
country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via
advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency
specifically targeted at that group.

Is the scope of the “making available” right in cross-border
situations – i.e. when content is disseminated across borders –
sufficiently clear?

 YES

NO– Please explain how this could be clarified and what type
of clarification would be required (e.g. as in "targeting"
approach explained above, as in "country of origin" approach23

The objective of implementing a “country of origin” approach is
tolocalise the copyright relevant act that must be licenced in
a single Member State (the "country of origin", which could be
for example the Member State in which the content is uploaded
or where the service provider is established), regardless of in
how many Member States the work can be accessed or received.
Such an approach has already been introduced at EU level with
regard to broadcasting by satellite (see Directive 93/83/EEC on
the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and
rights related to copyright applicable to satellite
broadcasting and cable retransmission).

)

If it was sufficiently clear this question would not be
required.

Clarify – is the JCEU statement the rule that should be used
going forward. You don't seem sure. I don't think “targetting”
is relevant. Consumers can come from any country, regardless of
the intents of the service provider. This is the reality of the
internet. If the service provider has to pay licenses in
advance for particular countries then of course they will want
to restrict access to the content. So, it might make sense for
producers to pay a single license fee for all of the EU or to
pay retrospectively depending on which countries actually
consume the content.

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a rightholder:]Could a clarification
of the territorial scope of the “making available” right have
an effect on the recognition of your rights (e.g. whether you
are considered to be an author or not, whether you are
considered to have transferred your rights ornot), on your
remuneration, or on the enforcement of rights (including the
availability of injunctive relief24

Injunctive relief is a temporary or permanent remedy allowing
the right holder to stop or prevent an infringement of his/her
right.

)?

YES– Please explain how such potential effects could be
addressed

Clearly. As discussed, making content available online means it
is practically available to all EU member states. If the
“making available” right is clear then I know whether I have
the rightto request licenses / renumeration from just those
“targetted” states or from all states which consume my
content in reality.

 NO

 NO OPINION

Two rights involved in a single act of exploitation

Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the
current state of technology and law) several reproductions.
This means that there are two rights that apply to digital
transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available
right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online
use notablywhen the two rights are held by different
persons/entities.

[In particular if you a service provider or a right holder:]Does
the application of two rights to a single act of economic
exploitation in the online environment (e.g. a download) create
problems for you?

YES– Please explain what type of measures would be needed in
order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint
licences when the rights are in different hands, legislation to
achieve the "bundling of rights")

I don't think the right to reproduce and the right to make
available fit well to the reality of the internet and the
content therein. I have attached a memo at the end of this
document which explains my position.

NO

 NO OPINION

Linking and browsing

Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one
location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for
the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are
pending before the CJEU25

Cases C-466/12 (Svensson), C-348/13 (Bestwater International)
and C-279/13 (C More entertainment).

in which the question has been raised whether the provision of
a clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the
public/making available to the public subject to the
authorisation ofthe rightholder.

A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly
creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache'
memory of his computer. A question has been referred tothe
CJEU26

Case C-360/13 (Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd).
See
alsohttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_PressSummary.pdf.

as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory
exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

Should the provision of a hyperlink leading to a work or other
subject matter protected under copyright, either in general or
under specific circumstances, be subject to the authorisation
of the rightholder?

NO– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
becauseit does not amount to an act of communication to the
public – or to a new public, or because it should be covered by
a copyright exception)

Hyperlinking to publically available internet content has
nothing to do with the copyright holder. No more than if
Imention to my colleague about a particular book in a
particular book store. (That being a verbal reference).

Hyperlinking to content with restricted access is also without
copyright impact as those without access will not be able to
follow the linkssuccessfully.

In general, the internet operates by copying content. Content
which is placed on an open access web page must be expected to
be freely copied and referenced. Please see attached memo. The
mentioned idea of “temporary copies” I believe is false.

YES– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case

Should the viewing of a web-page where this implies the
temporary reproduction of a work or other subject matter
protected under copyright on the screen and in the cache memory
of the user’s computer, either in general or under specific
circumstances, be subject to the authorisation of the
rightholder?

YES– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why

NO– Please explain whether you consider this to be the case
in general, or under specific circumstances, and why (e.g.
because it is or should be covered by a copyright exception)

In the general case content owners must expect that copyrighted
material which is posted on publicly accessible web pages, IE
those that can be freely accessed with a browser, without
registration and usernames and costs and so on, can and will be
freely copied without restriction. Ref attached memo.

Download to owndigital content

Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital
transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the
possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this
manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as agift). The
principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in
the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a
tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the
right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of
thattangible article)27

See also recital 28 of Directive 2001/29/EC.

. The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also
be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in
its effect to distribution (i.e. where the buyer acquires the
property of the copy)28

In Case C-128/11 (Oracle vs. UsedSoft) the CJEU ruled that an
author cannot oppose the resale of a second-hand licence that
allows downloading his computer program from his website and
using it for an unlimited period of time. The exclusive right
of distribution of a copy of a computer program covered by such
a licence is exhausted on its first sale. While it is thus
admitted that the distribution right may be subject to
exhaustion in case of computer programs offered for download
with the right holder’s consent, the Court was careful to
emphasise that it reached this decision based on the Computer
Programs Directive. It was stressed that this exhaustion rule
constituted alex specialisin relation to the Information
Society Directive(UsedSoft, par. 51, 56).

. This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the
practical application of such an approach (how to avoid
re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have
“re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and
delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of
the creation of a second-hand market of copies of perfect
quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand
market for physical goods).

[In particular if you are an end user/consumer:]Have you faced
restrictions when trying to resell digital files that you have
purchased (e.g. mp3 file, e-book)?

YES– Please explain by giving examples

I am under the impression that this would be illegal in my
member-state. IE I have mp3 files which I have downloaded. They
look the same as mp3 files which I could create by borrowing a
friends CD and copying it. I think the law would assume
copyright infringement if I sell them.

 NO

 NO OPINION

[In particular if you are a right holder ora service provider:]
What would be the consequences of providing a legal framework
enabling the resale of previously purchased digital content?
Please specify per market (type of content) concerned.

[Open question]

I do not feel this makes sense in themodern world. If I want to
consume copyrighted material, I should pay for the right to
consume that material. If another person wants to consume that
material they should pay for the right to consume it also. It
makes rather little difference whether or not they actually
obtain the content from me or from a distributor. The important
thing is the consumption not the obtaining. The fees for
consumption should go to the owner. Ref, attached memo.

Registration of works and other subject matter – is it a
goodidea?

Registration is not often discussed in copyright in the EU as
the existing international treaties in the area prohibit
formalities as a condition for the protection and exercise of
rights. However, this prohibition is not absolute29

For example, itdoes not affect “domestic” works – i.e. works
originating in the country imposing the formalities as opposed
to works originating in another country.

. Moreover a system of registration does not need to be made
compulsory or constitute a precondition for the protection and
exercise of rights. With a longer term of protection and with
the increased opportunities that digital technology provides
for the use of content (including older works and works that
otherwise would not have been disseminated), the advantages and
disadvantages of a system of registration are increasingly being
considered30

On the basis of Article 3.6 of the Directive 2012/28/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on
certain permitted uses of orphan works, a publicly accessible
online database is currently being set up by the Office for
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) for the
registration of orphan works.

.

Would the creation of a registration system at EU level help in
the identification and licensing of works and other subject
matter?

YES

 NO

 NO OPINION

What would be the possible advantages of such a system?

[Open question]

Copyright holders need to feel confident that they can defend
their works from misuse and misrepresentation andtheft.
Copyright holders may be more ready to make their works
publicly available if there is a voluntary registration system.
IE if there is a formal record that they own their work and what
that work comprises.

What would be the possible disadvantagesof such a system?

[Open question]

It may lead to the gradual introduction of enforced registration
for all copyright works which would be a disaster; content
creators would have no automatic rights to their own content,
privacy would impacted, costs would rise and so on.

So, it must be voluntary. It must not be a precondition for the
protection and exercise of rights. It should be complimentary
and supportive.

What incentives for registration by rightholders could be
envisaged?

[Open question]

Iobject to this stance – a registration system should be there
to support and protect copyright holders. We should not try to
force or dupe them into using such a system. We should
primarily make them aware of such a system and educate them on
the benefits.

How to improve the use and interoperability of identifiers

There are many private databases of works and other subject
matter held by producers, collective management organisations,
and institutions such as libraries, which are based to
a greater orlesser extent on the use of (more or less)
interoperable, internationally agreed ‘identifiers’.
Identifiers can be compared to a reference number embedded in a
work, are specific to the sector in which they have been
developed31

E.g. the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is used to
identify recordings, the International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) is used to identify books.

, and identify, variously, the work itself, the owner or the
contributor to a work or other subject matter. There are
notable examples of where industry is undertaking actions to
improve the interoperability of such identifiers and databases.
The Global Repertoire Database32

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.globalrepertoiredatabase.com/.

should, once operational, provide a single source of information
on the ownership and control of musical works worldwide. The
Linked Content Coalition33

You will find more information about this initiative (funded in
part by the European Commission) on the following website:
www.linkedcontentcoalition.org.

was established to develop building blocks for the expression
and management of rights and licensing across all content and
media types. It includes the development of a Rights Reference
Model (RRM) – a comprehensive data model for all types of
rights in all types of content. The UK Copyright Hub34

You will find more information about this initiative on the
following website:http://www.copyrighthub.co.uk/.

is seeking to take such identification systems a step further,
and to create a linked platform, enabling automated licensing
across different sectors.

What should be the role ofthe EU in promoting the adoption
of identifiers in the content sector, and in promoting the
development and interoperability of rights ownership and
permissions databases?

[Open question]

Clearly being organised, having a clear understanding of which
workis which, how works interrelate and who owns the copyright
for which works makes a lot of sense. The EU should support
these mechanisms where they simplify and clarify. The EU needs
to contribute to the current ongoing approaches and consider
whether anyof them would be appropriate to use at an EU level.
If they are appropriate artists and content owners need to be
encouraged to obtain an appropriate identifier.

Term of protection – is it appropriate?

Works and other subject matter are protected undercopyright for
a limited period of time. After the term of protection has
expired, a work falls into the public domain and can be
freelyused by anyone (in accordance with the applicable
national rules on moral rights). The Berne Convention35

Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works,http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/.

requires a minimum term of protection of 50 years after the
death of the author. The EU rules extend this term of
protection to 70 years after the death of the author (as do
many other countries, e.g. the US).

With regard to performers in the music sector and phonogram
producers, the term provided for in the EU rules also extend 20
years beyond what is mandated in international agreements,
providing for a term of protection of 70 years after the first
publication. Performers and producers in the audio-visual
sector, however, do not benefit from such an extended term of
protection.

Are the current terms of copyright protection still appropriate
in the digital environment?

YES– Please explain

NO– Please explain if they should be longer or shorter

I don’t think copyright protection is what we need in the
future. See attached memo. If we do retainwhat we have today,
however, then Yes the terms are fine.

 NO OPINION

Limitations and exceptions in the Single Market

Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights
enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter,
without obtainingauthorisation from the rightholders, for
certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use
for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a
teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are
established in a number of copyright directives, most notably
Directive 2001/29/EC36

Plus Directive 96/9/ECon the legal protection of
databases;Directive 2009/24/ECon the legal protection of
computer programs,and Directive 92/100/ECon rental right and
lending right.

.

Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws
have to respect international law37

Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (1971); Article 13 of the TRIPS
Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights)1994;
Article 16(2) of the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty
(1996); Article 9(2) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996).

. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis
requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in
certainspecial cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the
rightholders.

Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in
EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the
rights harmonised at EU level)38

Other than the grandfathering of the exceptions of minor
importance for analogue uses existing in Member States at the
time of adoption of Directive 2001/29/EC (see, Art.5(3)(o)).

, these limitations and exceptions are often optional39

With the exception of certain limitations: (i) in the Computer
Programs Directive, (ii) in the Database Directive, (iii)
Article 5(1) in the Directive 2001/29/EC and (iv) the Orphan
Works Directive.

, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in
national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish.
Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and
exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to
the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement
them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting
that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the
EU legal frameworkfor copyright are of equivalent significance
in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the
functioning of the Single Market.

In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the
rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the
territory of the Member State), the definition of
thelimitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too
(so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State
"A" may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once
we move to the Member State "B")40

Only the exception established in the recent Orphan Works
Directive (a mandatory exception to copyright and related
rights in the case where the rightholders are not known or
cannot be located) has been given a cross-border effect, which
means that, for instance, once a literary work – forinstance a
novel – is considered an orphan work in a Member State, that
same novel shall be considered an orphan work in all Member
States and can be used and accessed in all Member States.

.

The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also
raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In
some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate
rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or
exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are
not obliged, butmay decide, to provide for such compensation. If
a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair
compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the
books are used for illustration in an online course given by an
university in a Member State "A" and the students are in a
Member State "B") then there would also be a need to clarify
which national law should determine the level of that
compensation and who should pay it.

Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being
raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and
Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary
(either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an
exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation
of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether
a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and
Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required
legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single
Market, and respecting the EU'sinternational obligations.

Are there problems arising from the fact that most limitations
and exceptions provided in the EU copyright directives are
optional for the Member States?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

It is a problem if we as a union cannot agree on what copyright
means and how to enforce it. It is a problem if we need very
complicated bureaucracy to manage a simple facet of our
everyday lives. The paragraph above reads as though a lot of
money has been spent on rules and regulations and we are not
sure about their validity but we under no circumstances are we
going to change them.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

Should some/all of the exceptions be made mandatory and, if so,
is there a need for a higher level of harmonisation of such
exceptions?

YES– Please explain by referring to specific cases

A higher level of harmonisation benefits us all, it simplifies
legislation and enhances communication.

 NO – Please explain

NO OPINION

Should any newlimitations and exceptions be added to or removed
from the existing catalogue?Please explain by referring to
specific cases.

[Open question]

I get the general impression that if the EU has a long list of
exceptions and special cases, then really the concept of
copyright as a whole is not well thought out. I make an
alternative suggestion in the attached memo.

Independently from the questions above, is there a need to
provide for a greater degree of flexibility in the EU
regulatory framework for limitations and exceptions?

YES– Please explain why

 NO – Please explain why

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

NO OPINION

If yes, what would be the best approach to provide for
flexibility? (e.g. interpretation by national courts and
theECJ, periodic revisions of the directives, interpretations
by the Commission, built-in flexibility, e.g. in the form of a
fair-use or fair dealing provision / open norm, etc.)? Please
explain indicating what would be the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such an approach as well as its possible
effects on the functioning of the Internal Market.

[Open question]

The current system does not well fit to the reality of the use
of and distribution of content. The reason we have so many
exceptions and special cases is because the model we are using
is inappropriate and must be patched up. If we had a (rights)
model more closely aligned with reality, we could make it
simple and elegant and the need for exceptions would be
minimised.

Does the territorialityof limitations and exceptions, in your
experience, constitute a problem?

 YES – Please explain why and specify which exceptions you
are referring to

compensation is part of the exception? (e.g. who pays whom,
where?)

[Open question]

Access to content in libraries and archives

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their
national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the
benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational
establishments and museums, as well as archives. If
implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and
archiving41

Article 5(2)c of Directive 2001/29.

and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject
matter in the collections of such institutions42

Article 5(3)n of Directive 2001/29.

. The publiclending (under an exception or limitation) by these
establishments of physical copies of works and other subject
matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive43

Article 5 of Directive 2006/115/EC.

.

Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to
achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be
clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the
same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible
expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject
matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders.
The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between
different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.

Preservation and archiving

The preservation of the copies ofworks or other subject-matter
held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books,
records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works,
the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of
another copy/ies of these works or othersubject matter. Most
Member States provide for an exception in their national laws
allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope
of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as
regards the type of beneficiary establishments,the types of
works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of
copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary
establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new
types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving
publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

Off-premises access to library collections

Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation
ofworks and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book,
watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises
of such establishments for the purpose of research and private
study. The online consultation of works and other
subject-matter remotely(i.e. when the library user is not on
the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is
generally addressed in agreements between
universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law
rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to,
and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

experienced specific problems when trying to negotiate
agreements with rights holders that enable you to provide

[Open question]

I don’t understand. Why should lending material via online means
be any different from lending physical material. If content
owners agree that I can distributetheir content in a limited,
time-based fashion, then I don't think consumer location really
comes into it.

E – lending

Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of
works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users.
Recent technological developments have made it technically
possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access
to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via
networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to
obtain the authorisationof the rights holders to organise such
e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and
libraries are currently experimenting with different business
models for the making available of works online, including
direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling
by aggregators.

we can protect the rights of the owners.

[Open question]

We have a fear, don't we, that everyone is interested in making
an illegal copy of our work. We feel safe if libraries operate
in a traditional fashion; it is relatively hard work to
manually photocopy abook for example. We feel exposed if the
content is digitally conveyed; the expectation is that copies
can be made far more easily.

I think we need to change our whole idea of copyright and I’ve
detailed this in the attached memo.

Mass digitisation

Theterm “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts
by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g.
scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an
objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make
themavailable to the public. Examples are efforts by libraries
to digitise novels form the early part of the 20thcentury or
whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter
has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the
digitisation and making available of out of commerce works
(i.e. works which are no longerfound in the normal channels of
commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation
efforts (for books and learnedjournals) on the basis of licence
agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions
on the one hand and the collecting societies representing
authors and publishers on the other44

You will find more information about his MoU on the
followingwebsite:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/out-of-commerce/index_en.htm.

. Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation
projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU
should be that books that are currently to be found only in the
archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made
available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary
licences (granted by CollectiveManagement Organisations on the
basis of the mandates they receive from authors and
publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation
to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by
establishing in legislation a presumption ofrepresentation of
a collecting society or the recognition of an “extended
effect” to the licences granted)45

France and Germany have already adopted legislation to back the
effects of the MoU.The French act (LOI n° 2012-287 du 1er mars
2012 relative à l'exploitation numérique des livres
indisponibles du xxe siècle) foresees collective management,
unless the author or publisher in question opposes such
management.The German act (Gesetz zur Nutzung verwaister und
vergriffener Werke und einer weiteren Änderung des
Urheberrechtsgesetzes vom 1.Oktober 2013) contains a legal
presumption of representation by a collecting society in
relation to works whose rightholders are not members of the
collecting society.

.

[In particular if you are an institutional user,engaging or
wanting to engage in mass digitisation projects, a right
holder, a collective management organisation:]Would it be
necessary in your country to enact legislation to ensure that
the results of the 2011 MoU (i.e. the agreements concluded
between libraries and collecting societies) have a cross-border

EU?

digitisation should be simply permissible. Again, I feel we
need to change our view, consumption of the content should be
viewed as an act separate from the reproduction of the content.

Teaching

Directive 2001/29/EC46

Article 5(3)a ofDirective 2001/29.

enables Member States to implement in their national legislation
limitations and exceptions for the purpose of illustration for
non-commercial teaching. Such exceptions would typically allow
a teacher to use parts of or full works to illustrate his
course, e.g. by distributing copies of fragments of a book or
of newspaper articles in the classroom or by showing protected
content on a smart board without having to obtain authorisation
from the right holders. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementation at Member
States level. The implementation of the exception differs from
Member State to Member State, with several Member States
providing instead a framework for the licensing of content
forcertain educational uses. Some argue that the law should
provide for better possibilities for distance learning and
study at home.

works or other subject-matter are used in the context of
research projects/activities, including across borders?

YES

As an independent researcher, yes, of course I have had problems
trying to use works for research. It is more and more the case
that research materials (journals etc) are restricted access
only. IE I would need to purchase many journals to effectively
research. Or manually travel to a university library with the
content I am interested in.

NO

As a rights holder I have not had specific problems. For
research papers I am usually happy for others to be able to
read my content and make use of it. However, in reality, the
first step in publishing is usually to sign over the copyrights
to the publisher who then restricts access.

 NO OPINION

If there are problems, how would they best be solved?

[Open question]

Perhaps we should provide online access to as much content as
possibleand have separate mechanism for users to purchase
consumption rights. Perhaps some content should be free for
non-commercial use.

What mechanisms exist in the Member States to facilitate the use
of content for research purposes? How successful are they?

Disabilities

Directive 2001/29/EC48

Article 5 (3)b of Directive 2001/29.

provides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people
with a disability. The open formulation of this (optional)
provision allows for rather different implementations at Member
States level. At EU and international level projects have been
launched to increase the accessibility of works and other
subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by
increasing the number of works published in special formats and
facilitating their distribution across the European Union)49

The European TrustedIntermediaries Network (ETIN) resulting from
a Memorandum of Understanding between representatives of the
right-holder community (publishers, authors, collecting
societies) and interested parties such as associations for
blind and dyslexic persons
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/initiatives/access/index_en.htm)
and the Trusted Intermediary Global Accessible Resources (TIGAR)
project in WIPO (http://www.visionip.org/portal/en/).

The Marrakesh Treaty50

Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by
Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities,
Marrakesh, June 17 to 282013.

has been adopted to facilitate access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print
disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright
that allows organisations for the blind to produce,
distributeand make available accessible format copies to
visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the
rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to
sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of
certain provisions at EUlevel (e.g. to ensure the possibility
to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

(a)[In particular if you are a person with a disability or an
organisation representing persons with disabilities:]Have you
experienced problems with accessibility to content, including
across borders, arising from Member States’ implementation of
this exception?

(b)[In particular if you are an organisation providing services
for persons with disabilities:]Have you experienced problems
when distributing/communicating works published in special
formats across the EU?

(c)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experienced specific problems resulting from the application of
limitations or exceptions allowing for the
distribution/communication of workspublished in special
formats, including across borders?

 YES – Please explain by giving examples

Text and data mining

Text and data mining/contentmining/data analytics51

For the purpose of the present document, the term “text and data
mining” will be used.

are different terms used to describe increasingly important
techniques used in particular by researchers for the
exploration of vast amounts ofexisting texts and data (e.g.,
journals, web sites, databases etc.). Through the use of
software or other automated processes, an analysis is made of
relevant texts and data in order to obtain new insights,
patterns and trends.

The texts and data used for mining are either freely accessible
on the internet or accessible through subscriptions to e.g.
journals and periodicals that give access to the databases of
publishers. A copy is made of the relevant texts and data (e.g.
on browser cache memories or incomputers RAM memories or onto
the hard disk of a computer), prior to the actual analysis.
Normally, it is considered that to mine protected works or
other subject matter, it is necessary to obtain authorisation
from the right holders for the making of such copies unless
such authorisation can be implied (e.g. content accessible to
general public without restrictions on the internet, open
access).

Some argue that the copies required for text and data mining are
covered by the exception for temporary copies in Article 5.1 of
Directive 2001/29/EC. Others consider that text and data mining
activities should not even be seen as covered by copyright. None
of this is clear, in particular since text and data mining does
not consist only of a single method, but can be undertaken in
several different ways. Important questions also remain as to
whether the main problems arising in relation to this issue go
beyond copyright (i.e. beyond the necessity or not to obtain
the authorisation to use content) and relate ratherto the need
to obtain “access” to content (i.e. being able to use e.g.
commercial databases).

A specific Working Group was set up on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results. At the same time,
practical solutions to facilitate text and data mining of
subscription-based scientific content were presented by
publishers as an outcome of “Licences for Europe”52

See the document “Licences for Europe – ten pledges to bring
more content
online”:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/licences-for-europe/131113_ten-pledges_en.pdf.

. In the context of these discussions, other stakeholders argued
that no additional licences should be required to mine material
to which access has been provided through a subscription
agreement and considered thata specific exception for text and
data mining should be introduced, possibly on the basis of
a distinction between commercial and non-commercial.

(a)[In particular if you are an end user/consumeror an
institutional user:]Have you experienced obstacles, linked to
copyright, when trying to use text or data mining methods,
including across borders?

(b)[In particular if you are a service provider:]Have you
experienced obstacles, linked to copyright, when providing
services based on text or data mining methods, including across
borders?

(c)[In particular if you are a right holder:]Have you
experiencedspecific problems resulting from the use of text and
data mining in relation to copyright protected content,
including across borders?

YES– Please explain

As a copyright holder I do feel rather miffed that companies
such as Google appear to have granted themselves the right to
copy and index content that I have produced. I would not mind
however if my documents were used for research purposes. I
think the problem is that the activities going on in the real
world don't necessarily match with our currentunderstanding of
the legislation. Ideally text and data mining should, indeed,
be unrestricted.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

and under what conditions?

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

If your view is that a different solution is needed, what would
it be?

[Open question]

Please see attached memo.

Are there other issues, unrelated to copyright, that constitute
barriers to the use of text or datamining methods?

[Open question]

Well, of course, the data needs to be imported into your data
mining system. Books may need to be scanned etc, languages
might need to be translated and so on. Keywords might need to
be chosen to describe the texts or thosethat are provided might
need to be rationalised across the whole set.

User-generated content

Technological and service developments mean that citizens can
copy, use and distribute content at little to no financial
cost. As a consequence, new types of online activities are
developing rapidly, including the making of so-called
“user-generated content”. While users can create totally
original content, they can also take one or several
pre-existing works, change something in the work(s), and upload
the result on the Internet e.g. to platforms and blogs53

A typical example could be the “kitchen” or “wedding” video
(adding one's own video to a pre-existing sound recording), or
adding one's own text to a pre-existing photograph. Other
examples are “mash-ups” (blending two sound recordings), and
reproducing parts of journalistic work (report, review etc.) in
a blog.

. User-generated content (UGC) can thus cover the modification
of pre-existing works even if the newly-generated/"uploaded"
work does not necessarilyrequire a creative effort and results
from merely adding, subtracting or associating some
pre-existing content with other pre-existing content. This kind
of activity is not “new” as such. However, the development of
social networking and social media sitesthat enable users to
share content widely has vastly changed the scale of such
activities and increased the potential economic impact for
those holding rights in the pre-existing works. Re-use is no
longer the preserve of a technically and artistically adept
elite. With the possibilities offered by the new technologies,
re-use is open to all, at no cost. This in turn raises
questions with regard to fundamental rights such the freedom of
expression and the right to property.

A specific Working Group was setup on this issue in the
framework of the "Licences for Europe" stakeholder dialogue. No
consensus was reached among participating stakeholders on either
the problems to be addressed or the results or even the
definition of UGC. Nevertheless, a wide rangeof views were
presented as to the best way to respond to this phenomenon. One
view was to say that a new exception is needed to cover UGC, in
particular non-commercial activities by individuals such as
combining existing musical works with videos, sequences of
photos, etc. Another view was that no legislative change is
needed: UGC is flourishing, and licensing schemes are
increasingly available (licence schemes concluded between
rightholders and platforms as well as micro-licences concluded
between rightholders and the users generating the content. In
any event, practical solutions to ease user-generated content
and facilitate micro-licensing for small users were pledged by
rightholders across different sectors as a result of the
“Licences for Europe” discussions54

I believe people should be free to create derived works. They

Private copying and reprography

Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to implement in their
national legislation exceptions or limitations tothe
reproduction right for copies made for private use and
photocopying55

Article 5. 2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2001/29.

. Levies are charges imposed at national level on goods
typically used for such purposes (blank media, recording
equipment, photocopying machines, mobile listening devices such
as mp3/mp4 players, computers, etc.) with a view to compensating
rightholders for the harm they suffer when copies are made
without their authorisation by certain categories of persons
(i.e. natural persons makingcopies for their private use) or
through use of certain technique (i.e. reprography). In that
context, levies are important for rightholders.

With the constant developments in digital technology, the
question arises as to whether the copying of files
byconsumers/end-users who have purchased content online - e.g.
when a person has bought an MP3 file and goes on to store
multiple copies of that file (in her computer, her tablet and
her mobile phone) - also triggers, or should trigger, the
application of private copying levies. It is argued that, in
some cases, these levies may indeed be claimed by rightholders
whether or not the licence fee paid by the service provider
already covers copies made by the end user. This approach could
potentially lead to instances of double payments whereby levies
could be claimed on top of service providers’ licence fees56

Communication "Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in
Europe", COM(2012) 529 final.

These issues were addressed in the recommendations of Mr António
Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private copying and
reprography levies. You can consult these recommendations on
the following

.

There is also an on-going discussion as to the application or
not of levies to certain types of cloud-based services such
aspersonal lockers or personal video recorders.

In your view, is there a need to clarify at the EU level the
scope and application of the private copying and reprography
exceptions58

How would changes in levies with respect to the application to
online services (e.g. services based on cloud computing

devices) impact thedevelopment and functioning of new business
models on the one hand and rightholders’ revenue on the other?

[Open question]

Clearly additional costs would dissuade users from using cloud
computing for example, but I think a greater deterrent would be
the bureaucracy of registering and adding payment details.
Perhaps cloud services would just encrypt users data and choose
to not know what they store there.

Would you see an added value in making levies visible on the
invoices for products subject to levies?60

NO OPINION

Diverging national systems levy different products and apply
different tariffs. This results in obstacles to the free
circulation of goods andservices in the Single Market. At the
same time, many Member States continue to allow the
indiscriminate application of private copying levies to all
transactions irrespective of the person to whom the product
subject to a levy is sold (e.g. private personor business). In
that context, not all Member States have ex ante exemption
and/or ex post reimbursement schemes which could remedy these
situations and reduce the number of undue payments61

This issue was also addressed in the recommendations of Mr
Antonio Vitorino resulting from the mediation on private
copying and reprography levies.

Fair remuneration of authors and performers

The EU copyright acquis recognises for authors and performers a
number of exclusive rights and, in the case of performers whose
performances are fixed in phonograms, remuneration rights. There
are few provisions in the EU copyright law governing
thetransferof rights from authors or performers to producers62

See e.g. Directive 92/100/EEC, Art.2(4)-(7).

or determining who the owner of the rights is when the work or
other subject matter is created in the context of an employment
contract63

See e.g. Art. 2.3. of Directive 2009/24/EC, Art. 4 of Directive
96/9/EC.

. This is an area that has been traditionally left for Member
States to regulate and there are significant differences in
regulatory approaches. Substantial differences also exist
between different sectors of the creative industries.

Concerns continue to be raised that authors and performers are
not adequatelyremunerated, in particular but not solely, as
regards online exploitation. Many consider that the economic
benefit of new forms of exploitation is not being fairly shared
along the whole value chain. Another commonly raised issue
concerns contractual practices, negotiation mechanisms,
presumptions of transfer of rights, buy-out clauses and the
lack of possibility to terminate contracts. Some stakeholders
are of the opinion that rules at national level do not suffice
to improve their situation and that action at EU level is
necessary.

[In particular if you are an author/performer:] What is the best
mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) to ensure that you
receive an adequate remuneration for the exploitation of your
works and performances?

Is there a need to act at the EU level (for instance to prohibit

Currently companies in positions of power are able to exert a
great force on the content producers. For example e-book

Respect for rights

Directive 2004/48/EE64

Directive 2004/48/ECof the European Parliament and of the
Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights.

provides for a harmonised framework for the civil enforcement of
intellectual property rights, including copyright and related
rights. The Commission has consulted broadly on this text65

You will find more information on the following
website:http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/iprenforcement/directive/index_en.htm

. Concerns have been raised as to whether some of its provisions
are still fit to ensure a proper respect for copyright in the
digital age. On the one hand, the current measures seem to be
insufficient to deal with the new challenges brought by the
dissemination of digital content on the internet; on the other
hand, there are concerns about the current balance between
enforcement of copyright and the protection of fundamental
rights, in particular the right for a private life and data
protection. While it cannot be contested that enforcement
measures should always be available in case of infringement of
copyright, measures could be proposed to strengthen respect for
copyright when the infringed content is used for a commercial
purpose66

For example when the infringing content is offered on a website
which gets advertising revenues that depend on the volume of
traffic.

. One means to do this could be to clarify the role of
intermediaries in the IP infrastructure67

This clarification should not affect the liability regime of
intermediary service providers established by Directive
2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, which will remain unchanged.

. At the same time, there could be clarification of the
safeguards for respect of private life and data protection for
private users.

Should the civil enforcement system in the EU be rendered more
efficient for infringements of copyright committed with a
commercial purpose?

YES– Please explain

If a large corporation takes content which belongs to me, which
I have copyright over, it should be simple for me to assert my
rights over that content. Currently I believe it would be next
to impossible due to the legal costs involved.

 NO – Please explain

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

……………………………………………………………………………………………….

 NO OPINION

In particular, is the current legal framework clear enough to
allow for sufficient involvement of intermediaries (such as
Internet serviceproviders, advertising brokers, payment service

copyright infringements with a commercial purpose? If not, what
measures would be useful to foster the cooperation of
intermediaries?

A single EU Copyright Title

The idea of establishing a unified EU Copyright Title has been
present in the copyright debate for quite some time now,
although views as to the merits and the feasibility of such an
objective are divided. A unifiedEU Copyright Title would
totally harmonise the area of copyright law in the EU and
replace national laws. There would then be a single EU title
instead of a bundle of national rights. Some see this as the
only manner in which a truly Single Market for content
protected by copyright can be ensured, while others believe
that the same objective can better be achieved by establishing
a higher level of harmonisation while allowing for a certain
degree of flexibility and specificity in Member States’ legal
systems.

Should the EU pursue the establishment of a single EU Copyright
Title, as a means of establishing a consistent framework for
rights and exceptions to copyright across the EU, as well as a
single framework for enforcement?

YES

I don’t feel that copyright as such is the way forward. See
memo. However, I feel there would be great value in having a
clear and consistent approach applied throughout the EU. This
would best ensure maximum exposure and therefore revenue for
content owners and maximum availability for consumers. It would
simplify legislation and might provide and example for other
nations to follow.

 NO

Should this be the next step in the development of copyright in
the EU? Does the current level of difference among the

project?

Memo: A Suggested Future Approach To Copyright
==============================================

Dr Stuart Meikle

eucopyright@stumeikle.org

Executive Summary
-----------------

Copying content is easy and that is not likely to change.
Copying is a fundamental part of how the internet works.
Therefore having a "copy-right" is somewhat nonsensical in
today’s world. I propose droppingthis right and replacing it
with the "right to consume" and the "right to distribute". This
would rationalise the approach: it would leave content owners
able to make money form their content, it would simplify the
legal situation (exceptions such as the right to copy books
into Braille would be automatic), it would allow users to take
copies of their purchased content for preservation purposes. It
would be better grounded in the reality of the world we live in.

Introduction
------------

Copying content is today very easy, and will remain so. It
appears more and more the case that copyright protection
mechanisms will be unable to stop content being copied.
Computers and the internet greatly facilitate this process -
the copying and distribution of those copies.

Theinternet functions through copying content. If I visit a web
page the content stored on the servers there is copied to my
computer. If I attach a photograph to an email the photograph
is copied to the mail server before being transferred and
further copied as it moves from server to server to its
destination. Some servers will retain copies, even if I do not
request or authorize it. You make the statement on page 15 of
your consultation document that:

"A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page)
regularly creates temporary copies of works and other
subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in
the 'cache' memory of his computer"

This term "temporary copies" is not correct. Content is not only
shown on screen and kept in the computers memory. Cached content
is always also copied as a file to disk. There is no obligation
for these browser cache files to be deleted. They may exist for
a short period or indefinitely. “temporary copies” is a comfort
term we use to prevent us havingto consider the true complexity
of the situation. Examples: home backup routines may
incidentally back up browser cache files, transferring them to
permanent storage. Any company or library which provides access
to the internet will have a cache of internet content stored on
disk. As mentioned, email systems may retain copies of content
indefinitely.

Thus, any work which is made publicly available on the internet
(IE not being password or registration restricted) must be
expected to be copied freely. This is how the internet works.

Proposal
--------

Abandon "copyright" as a legal right, and replace it with a new
set of rights. The right to copy should be automatic and free
for all.

Example: I purchase some content from a content creator. I am
free to make copies of that content without restriction. If the
content is a painting I can photograph it, if the content is a
DVD I can "rip" it and so on. (These acts cannot in any case be
realistically prevented).

Having the right to copy however, does not mean thatthe right to
distribute those copies is given, nor even the right to consume.
These are detailed below.

Rights
------

The right to consume
--------------------

"Consume" here means, for example, reading a book, watching a
DVD, looking at a painting, executing software, and so on.
Consuming the content as opposed to simply having the content.
The right to consume may not automatically be given. For
example, I download a movie file from the internet. This means
I copy it onto mylocal computer hard drive. This act of copying
is legal in this proposal. I would not, however, have the right
to consume this media until I purchase the right to consume.

This is how television licenses work today. (In the UK at
least). I can purchase a television but before I can watch the
broadcasted content I need to buy a TV license. In the UK most
consumers purchase these rights freely. (Approx 95% according
to wikipedia).

It is assumed that the right to consume would be attached to
physical media. If a consumer buys a DVD then they gain the
right to consume that DVD. If they sell the DVD then they lose
the right to consume that DVD and the new owner gains the
right.

The right to consume may be limited - consumption rights may be
granted for a period of time perhaps, or within a specific
location.Consumption rights may also have an attached "feature
level". For example I may own the right to consume a given
movie at a particular resolution but I may need to purchase
additional rights to consume at a higher resolution. It may
also be restricted to "non-commercial purposes", for example I
might obtain software and be only able to use it for
non-commercial purposes.

The right to distribute
-----------------------

This means the right to assign the "right to consume". Like the
right to consume, may be attached to a time orplace or other
circumstances and feature levels. Example - if a consumer buys
an e-book from Amazon, Amazon transfers the contents to them
and Amazon grants them the right to consume that content. If I
buy a book there is an implied right to distribute 1 "right to
consume" with that book; I am able to sell the book and
transfer the right to consume. If I own a cinema and show a
movie, I need the right to distribute that content so that
people in the cinema have the right to consume (watch in this
case) themovie within the confines of the theatre.

Use Cases
---------

The "Use Cases" below show examples of content consumption and
how the proposed rights would be used.

Content placed as open access on the internet
---------------------------------------------

Unless stated otherwise consumers would have theautomatic right
to consume and the right to distribute. IE a consumer could
look at the web content, or listen to the audio and they could
also create their own web pages which use the content and thus
implicitly transfer the right to consume.

Content placed for free but restricted access on the internet
-------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the right to consume is given to the consumer but
(expected) that the right to distribute is not. The consumer
can consume but cannot derive works from the content or
directly link to thecontent in their own web pages.

Content sold via the internet
-----------------------------

The right to consume is really what is being purchased in this
case as the right to copy is implicit. If I purchase and
download an mp3 file from a web page I gain the right to
consume it but not the right to distribute.

Content rented via libraries
----------------------------

The borrower, renter, of library content has the right to
consume but restricted to the lending period stipulated by the
library. If the borrow makes a copy of the material, they do
not have the right to consume that material outside the lending
period stipulated by the library. They may of course purchase
the right elsewhere.

Content viewed in the cinema or art galleries
---------------------------------------------

The right to consume is given to those people visiting the
gallery orviewing the film in the cinema. IE it is location and
time bound. The right to distribute is not given. The cinemas
could also ban the use of recording devices if they so choose,
though this would be their house rules rather than the word of
law.

Content used for research, for data mining etc.
-----------------------------------------------

Provided that the researchers have the right to consume the
given content there is no issue. Copyright is implicit. No
exception is needed in this case.

Content copied for preservation purposes
----------------------------------------

Similarly to the previous case, copying for preservation
purposes is an implicit right.

Purchasing Media
----------------

It would assumed that purchasing original, physical copies of
content, such as DVDs and books, would confer to the purchaser
the right to consume and the right to distribute 1 copy of the
work. IE I have the right to read the book I buy and I have the
right to sell it on (once only) to a third party.

Creation of Derived Works
-------------------------

Everyone is free to create new works based on previous works.
Distribution of these new works would require the right to
distribute the source works also. In the case of internet
content this would generally be the case. The original content
owners should be acknowledged when the derived work is
distributed. If the derived work is damagingto the original
works owner (for example if brand images are tarnished through
negative association) then that may be a case for "normal",
non-rights related legislation.

Copying of ideas, look and feel
-------------------------------

It is expected that this is covered by existinglaws. IE where
content is not copied but where the style of the content, the
design language, the look and feel is copied, then existing
laws would protect this. Much as is with patents.

Content Identifiers
-------------------

An agreed set of content identifiers supportsthis work. If all
stake holders can agree that a particular content at a
particular feature level has a particular identifier this
naturally helps manage the consumption and distribution rights
of that content, particularly across borders. It is not a
requirement but it would facilitate management.

Content Registration
--------------------

Again, not a requirement but a facilitator. If, as a content
owner, I can register my content, perhaps together with its
identifier, then I can be more confident that my content will
notbe stolen or misused. I can more easily assert my rights to
control that content.

It may also be envisioned, in a futuristic sense, that a
database might be maintained which records which consumers have
the rights to consume and distribute which content. This may
protect consumers who purchase rights (see below) separately
from the content.

Advantages of Proposed Approach
-------------------------------

The proposed approach largely fits in with practises of today.
There is no suggestion to change current behaviours. I still
envisage purchasing, consuming, distributing content much as it
is today. However the proposed legislation is more realistic,
acknowledging how the world is today, in this information age;
it acknowledges how the internet functions without requiring
hazy "temporary copies" terms. It does not open any doors to
illegal activity which are not already open.

It simplifies current legislation. Much of the exception cases
we have, such as the right to make copies for preservation, the
right to copy books into Braille,the right make derived content,
the right to data minding, would not be required. These would be
an implicit right.

It promotes the use or development of a system of international
content identifiers.

It promotes the use or development of a register orcontent
owners and consumers rights to consume and distribute.

People want to consume content. They want quick and easy access
to content. They don't want to undertake illegal activities but
they want content more than this. So they will break the law in
order to obtain the content they want if that enables them to
obtain it in the time frames they want. They would prefer to
pay a small or reasonable fee to obtain the content legally
(ref: BBC TV license adoption rates mentioned above). Current
methods of legal purchasing are generally slow - buying
physical media from shops or online is slow and often content
is not available. Approaches such as regular small payments for
downloads are becoming popular. Eg Lovefilm.com and so on.

So, human preference when obtaining content is stipulated as
being: obtain content rapidly and legally, else obtain content
rapidly and illegally else obtain content by normal physical
purchase legally else obtain content by physical means
illegally.

This approach decouples the distribution of content from the
acquisition of consumption and distribution rights which has
the potential to make content far more readily available and to
open up new markets for the buying and selling of rights. For
example, it could be envisaged that movies could be distributed
to consumers via Torrent-based web services. (As it is today,
illegally). Users would be free to download content as they
wish but they would have to separately purchase consumption
rights. This might be done online, perhaps,or there may be
multiple competing firms selling consumption rights. With
regards to the previous paragraphs this would greatly improve
access to content and would increase revenues to content
owners.

Disadvantages
-------------

This approach is fanciful andforward looking. It is supposed
that implementation would require substantial changes to
existing legislation. It would require considerable further
discussion and considerable time and cost to implement. It
would be a long term investment.
